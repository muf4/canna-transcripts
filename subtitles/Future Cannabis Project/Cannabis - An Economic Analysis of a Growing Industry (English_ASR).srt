1
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:22,379
really California trip I mentioned

2
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,109
earlier California has always been at

3
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:28,559
the forefront of marijuana reform past

4
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,449
proposition 215 almost 20 years ago and

5
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,070
have had a very those activists in the

6
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,450
room I've been doing this for 10 years

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,140
there's activists in the room of been

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,329
doing it much longer than that and now

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,058
we're standing here in a world that is

10
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,939
completely different than - 10 20 years

11
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:48,089
ago not only do we have medical cannabis

12
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:51,420
in 23 states but in the District of

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,539
Columbia we also have adult use markets

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,899
emerging Colorado Washington Oregon soon

15
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:01,558
Alaska and DC soon enough here in

16
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,320
California it's ours to lose 2016 but

17
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,030
these markets are also different every

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,438
every regulation every regulatory

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,299
framework and structure is different

20
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,649
than the one before it and sometimes

21
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,110
especially on the East Coast like the

22
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,900
the regulation seemed crazier than the

23
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,759
one before that came before it so and

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,100
there's also a little micro economies

25
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,549
within each state especially a huge

26
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:26,519
state like California where Los Angeles

27
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,460
is vastly different than in San

28
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:32,519
Francisco and so we have a assembled a

29
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,139
great panel from states across the

30
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,030
country and also national players to

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,200
kind of give a look from their

32
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,840
perspective at the different markets and

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,329
the economic opportunities because even

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,210
in these these heavily regulated markets

35
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:50,508
like New York Illinois there are

36
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:53,429
opportunities I'm so I'm going to start

37
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:56,118
with Jill actually always introduce the

38
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:00,030
whole panel to lamoureux

39
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:02,938
an advisor with bo tech and several

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,519
other other hats and then we have James

41
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:09,079
Slavik with Bank Corporation and Midwest

42
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,669
Matt Carnes with green wave advisors

43
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,920
Erin justice of buds and roses here in

44
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:14,239
LA

45
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:17,780
and you just told me your name and I

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,580
made you give me your card John KJ with

47
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,110
new fronts here so we'll start with Jill

48
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,110
since you're here to my right

49
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:31,039
so my name is Jill Amaro I am a former

50
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:34,489
operator in Colorado starting about 2008

51
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:37,039
i have worn several hats but most of

52
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,480
them focus on regulatory analysis and i

53
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,810
kind of wanted to talk a little bit

54
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,429
about how regulation actually drives all

55
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,250
of these different markets we're going

56
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,540
to be talking about so when we look at

57
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,520
new states one of the things i hope

58
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:51,560
people do is apply in the onboarding

59
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,469
states and come up with pro formas and

60
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,709
financials and the first thing that i do

61
00:02:54,469 --> 00:03:00,349
when making projections first state is

62
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,509
go to the regulations and say what do

63
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:04,849
they say about the potential market size

64
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:07,370
and so I just kind of wanted to talk

65
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:09,259
about a couple of the major inputs and

66
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,959
and you guys in California have the

67
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:13,699
opportunity I've had a lot of people ask

68
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,739
me oh if you read the regulations and

69
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:18,048
I'm like you don't have regulations yet

70
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:20,900
this is legislation we have about

71
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:22,640
another five six hundred pages coming

72
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,289
and hopefully there'll be the

73
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,179
opportunity to provide a lot of input

74
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:27,949
into that process for those of you who

75
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,159
are here on the ground and advocates and

76
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:33,109
looking to make sure that this market

77
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,299
evolves the way that you can capitalize

78
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,910
on it so some of the major drivers the

79
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,019
one of the first things we look at you

80
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:40,609
know the economics start with the

81
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,409
patients one of the first things we look

82
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,610
at is what's the condition list and

83
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,810
that's not going to change here in

84
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,269
California probably has the best

85
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,400
condition listed in the country other

86
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,019
than maybe Massachusetts in Maryland and

87
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,730
a few states where they let doctors

88
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:56,269
prescribe for pretty much anything they

89
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:59,238
want but chronic pain and PTSD are the

90
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:01,579
two indicators we look at first 90% of

91
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,379
patients report chronic pain is why they

92
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:06,110
are using medical cannabis so it is

93
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:09,560
crucial in a good market for that to be

94
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:11,739
there the other thing with patients is

95
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,629
how hard is it to obtain a card are

96
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:16,000
there very few doctors because there's a

97
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,199
lot of pressure on them

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,420
there are a lot of doctors is it

99
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,430
expensive in Illinois you have to be

100
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,949
fingerprinted as a patient so that

101
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,600
drives our estimate of patient basis way

102
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:28,449
way down because not many people want to

103
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,830
subject themselves to that and I talked

104
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:31,420
a little bit about the environment for

105
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:33,279
the doctors so then the next thing is

106
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,350
what is it going to cost operators to

107
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,409
grow so what regulations really impact

108
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:41,260
operators plant limits canopy limits

109
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,780
really dictate how a market is if they

110
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:46,139
restrict the size of an operation you're

111
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:48,459
cutting down on economies of scale in

112
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:51,099
Washington for example where they have

113
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:52,269
plant canopies you have operators going

114
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,280
well can i stack

115
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:56,889
can I go vertical can I have three tiers

116
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:59,799
so there's always going to be that how

117
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:03,668
limited is my actual potential growth

118
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,040
and the other thing cannabinoid limits

119
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:08,560
so we see in Florida where you have to

120
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,750
be under point eight percent THC we see

121
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,759
in New York you can only have five

122
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,350
brands and they must be within one

123
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,469
hundred and five percent of this ratio

124
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,390
that drives up costs significantly when

125
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,130
you have to you know fraction eight and

126
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,949
separate Cambo noids and make sure that

127
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:26,319
your formulations are really on par with

128
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:28,870
what the legislation says and then

129
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,930
limited licenses that I mean for sure

130
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,790
dictates the size of a market is there

131
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,850
going to be competition or they're only

132
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,260
going to be 15 operators if there's only

133
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,350
Connecticut for example there's four if

134
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:43,120
one of those operators fails great for

135
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,790
the other operators but are they scaled

136
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,860
properly can they pick up the slack can

137
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,660
they you know can four people with all

138
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:53,560
that capex on them the amount of

139
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,689
investment they had to put into these

140
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,939
grows it was huge and so if they're not

141
00:05:55,689 --> 00:06:00,129
prepared for that or they're not ready

142
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:02,500
for the market to come out way slower

143
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:05,079
than they anticipated it can really

144
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,540
impact the market if nobody is supplying

145
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:10,089
or producing or marketing to create a

146
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,270
patient base it can be really really

147
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:15,369
terrible what are the excise or VAT tax

148
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:17,199
and you know in Washington it was a

149
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,120
three-tiered system where it was 25

150
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,849
percent on top of 25 percent on top of

151
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,769
25 percent and they've already looked at

152
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,450
reworking that because if the taxes are

153
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:28,060
too high you obviously can't compete

154
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:29,469
with the black market what are the

155
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,089
Quality Assurance requirement

156
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,100
what are the testing requirements what

157
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,989
are the compliance requirements in

158
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,800
Colorado it started out that there was

159
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,389
zero quality assurance items at all and

160
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,460
as we have evolved now you have to have

161
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,219
an industrial hygienist you have to

162
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:47,199
touch a test every batch are there batch

163
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,700
limits does a lot size have to be five

164
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,529
pounds am I going to be testing every

165
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:53,529
five pounds or every twenty pounds and

166
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:55,659
what is the you know what is the number

167
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:57,339
of tests I have to do is this a twenty

168
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,770
five dollar potency test or is this a

169
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:02,829
thousand dollar full slate of tests on

170
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:04,659
every five pounds accounting and

171
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:06,159
record-keeping requirements you know you

172
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,900
wouldn't even think about this but if

173
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,350
they tell you you have to store camera

174
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:14,620
data for 90 days your you know server

175
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:16,660
and your computer costs go way way up

176
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,030
and so even the simplest thing like that

177
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,919
and how long are we gonna store these

178
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:21,939
videos for is critical so when you're

179
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:24,399
going through this mind-numbing

180
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:26,290
regulatory process you gotta look at

181
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,029
those little things and be like is this

182
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,300
gonna cost me money and those are the

183
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:33,959
ones to fight for or against and then

184
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,579
the demand factors are their purchase or

185
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:39,339
possession requirements or their limited

186
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:41,829
amounts that a patient can buy that

187
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:43,750
really really drives your budget as well

188
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:45,849
and then you know most recently

189
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,079
Minnesota just had an article about how

190
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,360
everybody's still on the black market

191
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,909
because the cost is just too high there

192
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,139
so when talking with regulators those

193
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,760
are the kind of things that you want to

194
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,860
pay attention to and be like if we drive

195
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,870
the cost way way we have an established

196
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,210
market here in California you have a set

197
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,069
price if the regulations drive that up

198
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:08,168
too much they're gonna force people back

199
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:10,750
into the black market so my talk will be

200
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:12,159
entirely different than Jill's because

201
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,220
I'm gonna take a step back because this

202
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,160
is the economics of cannabis so I'm

203
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,690
involved I started in 2009 on the

204
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,290
packaging side I started a company

205
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:26,350
called pop bottles calm and then kind of

206
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:28,180
morphed into the medicine side and now I

207
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:31,390
think arguably were when the largest

208
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,700
companies were in multiple states and so

209
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:36,639
I've seen the evolution of this industry

210
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,080
and now it's sort of at another croc

211
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,299
strip if you were here for the last

212
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,288
session trip was hitting on this and we

213
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:45,198
say you know the next great American in

214
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:47,870
stree and so when we talk about the the

215
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:51,289
economics of that there's you know the

216
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:54,440
challenges and the opportunities Aaron

217
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:56,750
is involved and and also I I must

218
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,759
preface this by saying there's always

219
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,440
the activism side because we're still

220
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,350
putting people in jail for possession of

221
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,500
this plant and that's kind of what got

222
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:09,680
me involved in the activism side a a

223
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:12,980
very quick story I was delivering I met

224
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,979
a elderly couple and they were getting a

225
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,449
cookie because this woman had

226
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,550
osteoarthritis and she was in pain in

227
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:22,068
the city of San Diego where we lived

228
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:23,809
they decided to shut down all the

229
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:26,360
collectives including that one where

230
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:27,828
this this elderly couple lived in an old

231
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,539
folks home and they came down they

232
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:31,698
didn't know about delivery service or

233
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:33,259
weed maps or Swede Maps they just knew

234
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:35,948
that this helped her more than the

235
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:38,060
vicodin they said the vicodin made her a

236
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:39,889
vegetable and you know all the other

237
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:43,250
side effects which I know about now -

238
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:44,959
I'm having that but they should the city

239
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,539
of San Diego and your government thought

240
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,369
better than them being able to have

241
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:50,929
access to that so they shut down that

242
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,690
collective and I was like you know what

243
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:56,388
that's just not right so I was like they

244
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,889
can't fight their eighty and infirm and

245
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:59,568
and I have a little bit of money and a

246
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:02,000
lot of gray hair so I'm gonna fight for

247
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:04,909
them I got on the activism side and I'm

248
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,679
on boards you know with MPP and I think

249
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:08,389
was one of the first people to get

250
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,969
involved with Aaron and the National

251
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:12,740
cannabis Industry Association so please

252
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,319
if you're not if you're just here for

253
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,360
the economic side of cannabis please

254
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:19,219
leave immediately because we're still

255
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,509
putting people in jail for this plant

256
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:26,120
and in harm reduction and what it's

257
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:28,399
doing to families and so forth and if we

258
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,709
don't address that we're really building

259
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,948
a house on a foundation of sand so

260
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:37,909
that's that's the the preface of speech

261
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:40,250
and Susan Susan knows that very well

262
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:43,250
so then back to the back to the business

263
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:46,370
opportunity so we've heard the the first

264
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,110
inning of the doubleheader or seven game

265
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:52,250
series or so forth there's no doubt it's

266
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:54,139
at the beginning so the what would I see

267
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,259
from from my level from going around the

268
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:59,120
the business interests and art view and

269
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:03,379
and the investors that at the very

270
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,480
beginning in 2009 10 and 11 no one would

271
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:07,759
invest so of course we have a hard time

272
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,370
getting banking of course we have a hard

273
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,318
time with the you know the IRS and 280e

274
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,509
and a number of things and we're doing

275
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:16,519
everything we can to resolve that but

276
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:18,409
there was just really no mechanism to do

277
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,389
a real business in California have to be

278
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:22,399
nonprofit other states you can be

279
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:24,589
for-profit so you know we're still

280
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,870
dealing that our corporate structure is

281
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:28,069
is convoluted because you know you're

282
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,778
not allowed to make a profit in

283
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:34,519
California from the sale of cannabis so

284
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:38,958
half the time you're dealing with

285
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:43,730
regulatory banks I've had ten banks in

286
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:46,369
six years and we are a there's a

287
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:48,528
multi-million dollar company and you

288
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,230
know we have a 401 K we have health

289
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:53,809
insurance we have corporate matching and

290
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,629
then they go oh yeah you have no bank

291
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:59,208
account I'm actually getting my

292
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:01,818
statements and then putting cash in an

293
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:06,258
envelope and we paid the tax payment

294
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:08,629
payments for the employees so very hard

295
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:11,990
to navigate that so you have a great

296
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:13,639
business model you've gone out and

297
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,948
you've raised your friends and family

298
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,680
capital and you're walking it out to the

299
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:21,799
marketplace well make sure that you

300
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,599
budget you know 30% for your of your

301
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:26,088
time for issues that you would never

302
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,100
deal with in any other business so if

303
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:29,449
you don't do that you're you're gonna be

304
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,720
in big trouble because when you get that

305
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:34,458
letter from Wells Fargo saying yes

306
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,278
you're dirty cannabis money is not

307
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:39,409
welcome here and we don't have to give

308
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:42,860
you a reason why and and and they won't

309
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:45,559
I've also been evicted twice we wanted a

310
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,810
buying a building in in San Diego

311
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,750
because we've been evicted twice and it

312
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:54,769
very costly to move so that impacts the

313
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:59,899
you know the business and its future so

314
00:12:54,769 --> 00:13:03,329
going back to investment the future

315
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:05,850
we're seeing a very very very big

316
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,460
morphing now of the level of

317
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,370
sophistication of investors at the

318
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,680
beginning of art view we had 13 people

319
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,060
sit around a conference table and and we

320
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,769
were gonna put our own money in and

321
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,509
people came and pitched us a PowerPoint

322
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:20,370
and then he said who's interested in

323
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:23,610
that would raise our hand now ArcView

324
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:26,509
has over 450 maybe 500 accredited

325
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:29,940
investors people are now coming from

326
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:33,299
from Europe seeing the opportunity here

327
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,940
and in investing in this industry

328
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:37,259
originally they wouldn't touch the plant

329
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,990
still a lot of them are like that they

330
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:42,269
will invest in software and security and

331
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,600
and you know business services or

332
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:47,069
containers or any one of a myriad of

333
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,600
things that don't actually touch the

334
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,140
plant but are involved and generally in

335
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:56,899
the issue in this space that is now

336
00:13:52,139 --> 00:14:00,600
changing more and more I'd say easily

337
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:02,429
50% of the investment companies firms

338
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:08,070
and individuals are now willing to

339
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:10,529
invest in grows processing you know we

340
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,420
see a lot of action and a space that

341
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:15,959
we're in the vape pen and concentrate

342
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:18,899
space and so we expect that to continue

343
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,240
so the risk profile originally no and

344
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,399
very few investors were willing to touch

345
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,250
over you touch a plant well no I much

346
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,079
rather invest in a software program that

347
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,419
helps people you know attract patients

348
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:34,110
so for a long time the largest company

349
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:35,579
in the space was weed maps because they

350
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,919
had what we call the first mover

351
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,910
advantage and they had a model that drew

352
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:44,370
a lot of traffic to dispensaries and you

353
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:45,870
know I'm gonna take a wild guess and say

354
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,778
there about a twenty five million dollar

355
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,850
company so in any multi billion-dollar

356
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:52,740
industry if the biggest company in the

357
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,100
space is twenty five million dollars in

358
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,009
revenue

359
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:59,909
it shows how how fractionated it it's

360
00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:02,610
just use a cannabis term we it's so

361
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:05,129
segmented so small so nobody is

362
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:09,120
is a bent there's no you know Kleenex or

363
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:12,208
band-aid in in cannabis as yet as much

364
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,799
as brands like bang or Dixie would like

365
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:16,049
to think you know Oh everybody knows

366
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:17,789
knows us well you know we're in the

367
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,319
industry so people in the industry you

368
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:21,480
go to somebody in the general public and

369
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,190
say you know what's Dixie or what's bang

370
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,899
and they're like I have no frickin idea

371
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:32,700
so we're seeing this with media there's

372
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:36,299
a lot of media ideas we saw a new media

373
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:39,839
venture that Snoop Dogg was launching

374
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:41,490
this week and so where is that target

375
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,300
what are people going after what they're

376
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:47,549
going after is the Millennials that's

377
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:50,419
you know the biggest spender and the

378
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:54,809
biggest growth area in cannabis and

379
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:58,588
we've all been fighting over this this

380
00:15:54,809 --> 00:16:01,049
core group of stoners the the ones that

381
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:04,800
love it and we got in the arms race of

382
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:06,659
the higher and higher dosages because

383
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,909
you know it was like an arms race if you

384
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:11,789
sold you know our bar we went for the

385
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:14,969
chocolate we went from you know 60 to

386
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:17,219
120 to 180 in the milligram strength and

387
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,860
every time we did that the sales doubled

388
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,870
of the higher milligram so you know like

389
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,629
how high was up when we started seeing

390
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,889
things in the thousand milligrams now

391
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:30,088
regulations are coming in with those

392
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:31,740
specific type situations and I believe

393
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,529
personally that that's where the growth

394
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:37,350
is and the so-called low dose 5 10 15

395
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:38,759
milligram products and that's going to

396
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,100
appeal because we've all heard the

397
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,620
horror stories of IOD Don edibles and

398
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,839
I've od'd on edibles so I I have

399
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,129
personal experience there and then a lot

400
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,660
of times people once they OD and it

401
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:50,309
almost like fuck that I'm never gonna

402
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:51,809
eat that it yeah I'm not I'm that don't

403
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:54,000
give me that cookie like forget it

404
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:55,439
because you know if you had a bad

405
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,419
experience then you're kind of out of

406
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,500
the market so you know the education

407
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:04,139
side the low dosing side that's gonna

408
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,140
bring in about another core group of

409
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,809
about 30 million so we estimate that the

410
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:12,990
the hardcore stoner market is about 10

411
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:16,109
million people and that the Millennials

412
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,789
that know cannabis maybe tried it

413
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:19,919
really know where to go where to get the

414
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:22,409
information we think that is about 30

415
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,900
million so it's three times bigger so

416
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:27,449
you got like 25 companies all fighting

417
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,900
over that hardcore $10,000,000 stoner

418
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,240
market

419
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,210
I'd much rather target that 30 million

420
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,279
market that likes it thinks that it

421
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,710
could be cool but don't know where to go

422
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,339
what to get what's the cool thing and

423
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:46,470
that's that's the next frontier I feel

424
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:54,119
in the economic growth of cannabis so

425
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:58,798
that's my five minutes thanks James all

426
00:17:54,119 --> 00:18:01,349
right well I'm a I'm a numbers guy I've

427
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,730
never actually touched the plant well

428
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:04,709
that's not actually true but I have

429
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:07,079
never worked touching the plant I should

430
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,569
say that and I'm a numbers guy I worked

431
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:13,289
I started my career as an auditor with

432
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:16,379
Price Waterhouse and I then went to Wall

433
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:19,168
Street and so to me I really find this

434
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,840
industry of great intrigue from a

435
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:23,640
numbers perspective because you know we

436
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,859
all know that this is an industry that's

437
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,020
really thriving and is going to continue

438
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:31,649
to do so but I really felt it was

439
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:33,389
necessary to get an understanding of you

440
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:37,250
know the industry dynamics what is

441
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:40,320
unfolding to help investors understand

442
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,730
the different dynamics that we're seeing

443
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,099
in each state so what I've done the last

444
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,860
year I started Green Wave advisors and

445
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:48,689
I'm leveraging my prior work experience

446
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:51,298
to really get an understanding of what's

447
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,640
going on state by state I've gone

448
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:55,619
through the arduous tasks

449
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,590
single-handedly of going to each state

450
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:01,019
compiling data and analyzing that data

451
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:03,928
and trying to make sense of the industry

452
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:06,329
so that investors are better informed so

453
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:09,169
when the day comes they'll they'll have

454
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:11,460
something for them to you know really

455
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:14,280
give a better understanding of what's

456
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,380
going on the industry and so what we've

457
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,269
done is we've went state-by-state we've

458
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,770
defined like what the addressable market

459
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:22,079
is on the medical marijuana side

460
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:24,240
determining how many people have cancer

461
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,460
how many people have glaucoma etc etc

462
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,980
and then we determine what the potential

463
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,009
market sizes so and these are all

464
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,620
broad-based assumptions

465
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:34,119
you know in certain categories and then

466
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:35,889
we looked at Colorado we looked at the

467
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:37,899
penetration rates and we apply this

468
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:40,150
exercise state-by-state and you know we

469
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,810
drilled out and we of course focused in

470
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:45,130
also on California and as we did that we

471
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:47,470
then also determine what the

472
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,030
recreational market would look like now

473
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,220
that's a little bit more difficult to

474
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:53,589
assess because we don't have the data in

475
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:57,039
every state either the data is provided

476
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:58,899
by the state or if you're proactive you

477
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,309
could approach the state in in most

478
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,650
cases under the Freedom of Information

479
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:04,599
Act and get the information that you

480
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:08,320
need and so we compiled all this data

481
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:10,029
and now you know May it's the medical

482
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,819
mark it's a lot easier to assess because

483
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:15,039
then you could kind of determine what

484
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:16,210
average revenues are per patient and so

485
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,339
forth and we're developing all these

486
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,860
metrics the recreational side was still

487
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:22,689
continuing to evaluate so we sized the

488
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:24,519
market and we put our estimates you know

489
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,950
in a model and we have full transparency

490
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:30,730
as to how we get to our our numbers and

491
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,259
we estimate by 2020 under the normal

492
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,970
trajectory of when we think states are

493
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:37,150
going to legalize we expect a market of

494
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:40,779
about 22 billion and if you if you then

495
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:43,480
say okay in that first year remaining

496
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:49,690
states are legalized we easily get to 35

497
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:53,289
billion but then we kind of Auto report

498
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:56,890
last year we did what we expected that

499
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:58,750
when that the the medical market would

500
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,610
be disrupted by the recreational market

501
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,559
in Colorado it's the first state where

502
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:04,509
we have both a medical and a

503
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,519
recreational market that's commercially

504
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:08,349
available and so we're seeing will

505
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,089
continue to see a decline in

506
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:12,549
fundamentals and we expect that same

507
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:14,919
trend to happen in other states that

508
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:16,299
implement a recreational program where

509
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,009
there's a medical program so if you're

510
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:20,559
going to open a business in a medical

511
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:23,589
facility of a dispensary just be

512
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,359
cognizant and be mindful and and hope

513
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:28,899
that there would be state protections

514
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:30,759
that would enable you to have first dibs

515
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,460
on a recreational license like they did

516
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:35,680
in Colorado and they think they're doing

517
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,410
that in some other states as well so

518
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,570
then what we looked at from that we

519
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,250
really also have an industry thesis and

520
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:45,250
what we think is going to happen

521
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,799
is that the way the markets are right

522
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,059
now the the medical and the recreational

523
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,549
market will combine into one

524
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:53,829
substantially larger market and then the

525
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:55,960
medical market will recalibrate and that

526
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:59,319
will be defined they'll be more precise

527
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,329
dosage and so forth and Big Pharma will

528
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,220
probably come in and it will be

529
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:05,559
regulated by the FDA and really what

530
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,779
underscores that when I flew out here

531
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,519
yesterday it was a flight from hell I

532
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:12,819
miss my first flight and the silver

533
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,950
lining was that I was in a mil seat and

534
00:22:12,819 --> 00:22:17,349
I was next to a physician and a

535
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,400
pharmaceutical rep and I was like wow

536
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:19,779
this is gonna be a really good

537
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,220
conversation this isn't gonna be a

538
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:24,690
horrible flight but I'm gonna get a lot

539
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:27,039
of good information and and the doctor

540
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,350
really kind of underscored what we

541
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,409
believe is that the Met community the

542
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:34,599
met the medical marijuana market is only

543
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,269
as good as the doctors are willing to

544
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:39,849
recommend the product and it's right now

545
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:42,430
the patients are having to push the

546
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:43,959
product rather than the doctor I'm sorry

547
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,970
pull the prior to rather than the

548
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,130
doctors push the product to their

549
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,559
patients and the the doctor the

550
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,180
physician from Michigan said basically

551
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,579
you know we have a lot of concerns about

552
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,870
you know prescribing marijuana because

553
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:57,970
we don't know what's gonna happen we

554
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:59,379
don't know if then you know we tell one

555
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,850
guy that it's good and then he brings

556
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,980
five other people and they don't really

557
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:04,569
need it and so forth so there's a lot of

558
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,069
concern so then when I was talking to

559
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:07,929
the pharmaceutical rep and she said you

560
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:09,519
know some of my colleagues are really

561
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,779
concerned about the pharmaceutical

562
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,490
market that they're gonna lose their

563
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:13,450
jobs in a few years because marijuana is

564
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,819
gonna replace a lot of these

565
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,920
pharmaceuticals so I said well what what

566
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:19,839
do you sell what drug you sell she said

567
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,190
I sell for fertility drugs

568
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,689
I said well you don't have to worry

569
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,390
about your drug because as far as I know

570
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,960
there's no cannabinoid that is going to

571
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:31,090
address that right now you never know

572
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,069
and so what we're really striving to do

573
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:34,480
is to continue to evaluate all the

574
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:36,970
information that's coming out of these

575
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,710
states and it's like really

576
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,539
Lucy and Ethel and the Chocolate Factory

577
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:43,480
and there's there's just more and more

578
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:46,659
information coming out and what we are

579
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,400
really focused in on is to collect this

580
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,610
data and really analyze it and make

581
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,769
sense of it so when the time comes you

582
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:57,969
know you'll all be better informed

583
00:23:53,769 --> 00:24:00,879
and I on a personal note my mother I

584
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:03,279
mean a lot of this is really driven for

585
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,790
in memory of my mother she had Crohn's

586
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:08,470
disease and she was miserable and there

587
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:10,420
was nothing that was working and she got

588
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,700
sicker and sicker and sicker and she

589
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:15,190
just got more and more bitter among

590
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,559
about the medical profession finally we

591
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,660
got something for her up in Vermont that

592
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:22,089
you know alleviated a lot of the pain

593
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,410
well guess what then about I know six

594
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:27,429
months later she got diagnosed with lung

595
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:29,529
cancer and she went to chemotherapy so

596
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,630
it was early stage she had surgery and

597
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:33,160
you know it was four years and we just

598
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,020
watched her kind of you know we knew

599
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,360
that time is gonna come but during that

600
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:38,920
time we go the doctor you think any of

601
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,659
them said hey once try some marijuana

602
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,550
because every time they offered her

603
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:47,200
something for nausea it was making her

604
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:49,089
more sick so I wanted to do the my

605
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,069
brother's a lawyer he's like no no no my

606
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:53,169
sister likes to bake I'm like I live in

607
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:55,289
Manhattan I could get marijuana quicker

608
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:58,840
than I can get a pizza delivered so

609
00:24:55,289 --> 00:25:01,629
there was really nothing we could do and

610
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,579
then to add salt to injury for months

611
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,650
before she passed checked kidney stones

612
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:10,919
so if nothing else I needed the

613
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:10,920
marijuana so anyway that's my story

614
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:21,700
so my name is Aaron justice as Aaron

615
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,160
said I am the president of buds and

616
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,809
roses here in Los Angeles I also serve

617
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,460
on the board of directors for the

618
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:31,059
National cannabis Industry Association

619
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,620
with Aaron as our director I am on the

620
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:34,569
steering committee of glocca the Greater

621
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:36,099
Los Angeles collective Alliance where

622
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:40,539
our president is sitting right there

623
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:43,000
Yami bolaños say hi and glocca has been

624
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,009
trying to regulate cannabis dispensaries

625
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,519
in Los Angeles for almost 10 years

626
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:51,250
Yami's been at the forefront of that and

627
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:53,589
and I serve on other various committees

628
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,410
the patient provider network for

629
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:58,359
Americans for safe access do work with

630
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:01,480
American Herbal Products Association and

631
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:04,479
so on so for those of you who don't know

632
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,299
Los Angeles is by far the largest

633
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:12,539
cannabis marketplace city in the country

634
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:17,940
we currently have maybe 12 to 1800

635
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:20,559
dispensaries in the city of La the the

636
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:24,160
the big thing is that all of those

637
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:27,339
dispensaries are basically illegal about

638
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,170
100 of us have limited immunity from

639
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:32,259
prosecution where one of those

640
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:35,320
dispensaries and I pulled some numbers

641
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:38,230
from the office of Finance and last year

642
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:41,019
there was 100 million reported in sales

643
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:44,319
in the city of LA this is with all

644
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:47,710
illegal dispensaries as I said besides

645
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:49,450
some that have limited immunity and that

646
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:52,090
seems like a high number it's higher

647
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:54,870
than some states but the truth is I

648
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:59,169
believe it is grossly under reported

649
00:26:54,869 --> 00:27:01,479
almost 1,000 dispensaries reported to

650
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:04,000
the office of Finance and paid taxes but

651
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,269
if you do the math that's only 100,000

652
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,509
per dispensary which is not the average

653
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:12,099
it's much less than the average some

654
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:14,740
people looked into this some tax

655
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:17,769
authorities and found that a the

656
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:20,799
minority of these dispensaries paid the

657
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,369
majority of taxes and that makes perfect

658
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,909
sense

659
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:27,399
Los Angeles is similar to Washington DC

660
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,840
if you know they always scream about

661
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,970
taxation with

662
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:34,089
about representation and that's kind of

663
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:39,100
the thing in Los Angeles so we pay a 6%

664
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:41,889
gross sales tax but we're illegal and so

665
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:44,709
what I think is that the only way to

666
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:47,110
really get this under control is to

667
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,940
regulate it to a certain amount of

668
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:51,639
dispensaries we've been trying to do

669
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:55,298
that for years and to really audit these

670
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,460
dispensaries and to license them so that

671
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:59,679
we can build a real system here that

672
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,259
brings in instead of five million

673
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,600
dollars for the city which is nothing in

674
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:07,538
Los Angeles absolutely nothing that it

675
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:10,538
brings in forty to sixty million dollars

676
00:28:07,538 --> 00:28:13,808
in taxes and that's you know a number

677
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:17,379
that our officials will listen to beyond

678
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:19,808
that there is the sales tax I believe

679
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,000
that if we were doing those numbers a

680
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:24,759
billion dollars a years what I believe

681
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,619
the Los Angeles marketplace is today if

682
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:29,079
we were doing those kind of numbers we

683
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:31,359
would bring in 100 million dollars in

684
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:34,869
sales tax for the BOE

685
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:36,699
our Board of Equalization last I talked

686
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:39,099
to the BOE they were expecting to bring

687
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,798
in 100 million in the entire state I

688
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:44,259
believe that they have grossly

689
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:45,849
underestimated that and so what we're

690
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:49,000
doing is what we've always been trying

691
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:51,730
to do we just passed state well the

692
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,759
governor is almost signed state state

693
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:57,579
legislation here and what we are trying

694
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:59,440
to do is make the dispensaries in LA

695
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:01,298
that are under limited immunity we're

696
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,519
not authorized to operate which means

697
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:06,460
that this whole marketplace could

698
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,730
disappear or be completely black market

699
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,710
if the city doesn't act to regulate it

700
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:16,569
so again we are back in the trenches

701
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:18,819
glocca with asa most likely the union we

702
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:21,038
are trying to figure out for the city

703
00:29:18,819 --> 00:29:24,939
how to make a path to state licensure

704
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:27,369
and and and bring in the revenues that

705
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,669
the city should bring in and the state

706
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:33,129
should bring in and and basically

707
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:35,049
finally have a regulated system so what

708
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,760
we have now in the largest city the

709
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:39,879
largest retail market for cannabis in

710
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:42,400
the country is a really poor regulatory

711
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,250
system and hopefully our

712
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,740
vermin will act to reconcile this

713
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,259
because the excuse was always we have to

714
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,579
wait for the state let the state figure

715
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:54,700
out and then we'll go from there

716
00:29:51,579 --> 00:30:04,329
so hopefully we can turn this into a

717
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:06,309
real marketplace that's regulated thank

718
00:30:04,329 --> 00:30:08,349
you everyone and good afternoon my name

719
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:10,299
is John Katya and I am the director of

720
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:12,789
industry analytics with new frontier I

721
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:14,349
should preface this by saying I'm

722
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:16,359
sitting in for Giada Dakar sera new

723
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:18,789
frontier CEO who unfortunately got

724
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:20,229
detained in Washington and so even

725
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:23,740
though I'm nowhere near as attractive I

726
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:26,370
will try and present our points here as

727
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:29,200
well as she did as well she would have

728
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:31,719
so for those of you who don't know us

729
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,200
new frontiers a big data company focused

730
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,610
exclusively in the cannabis industry we

731
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,920
founded the company because we realized

732
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:41,229
that there was a dearth of good

733
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,509
intelligence about what's happening in

734
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,730
the industry how it was growing how it

735
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:48,220
was evolving and what market forces were

736
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:51,430
shrimping it's evolution so we brought

737
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,970
together a team of market strategists

738
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:58,299
economists strata statisticians

739
00:30:53,970 --> 00:31:01,150
technologists and industry analysts and

740
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:03,940
have done nothing but pour through data

741
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:07,180
from every state that has an active

742
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:11,380
market for the past year to really get

743
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:12,940
our hands into richer insight into some

744
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:16,870
of the factors that are shaping this

745
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:18,460
markets growth in evolution so to try

746
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:19,779
and help contextualize just some of the

747
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,299
things that we have found in our

748
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:24,069
research I'm gonna speak about five

749
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,480
different markets and just pick a point

750
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:27,669
about each market that I think is

751
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,430
illustrative of some of the issues that

752
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:31,960
are shaping this industry and I think

753
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:34,690
that we should consider as we look

754
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:39,039
forward to the markets growth so

755
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:41,500
starting first with a national market we

756
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,450
have spent a lot of time trying to get

757
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,279
our hands around how big this national

758
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,500
market is and as everyone here has

759
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,230
mentioned already this data is very very

760
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:53,460
difficult to come by but we have a team

761
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:55,680
of econometricians who applied a

762
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:58,980
patented very very sophisticated model

763
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:02,430
to all of the data that we have and we

764
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:04,049
project that this year the US market

765
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:06,840
will be slightly over five billion

766
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:08,519
dollars and that will grow to over seven

767
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:12,449
and a half seventeen and a half billion

768
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:14,879
dollars by 2020 one of the things that

769
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,799
were particularly focused on in the

770
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,290
national market as we have this

771
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,250
discussion about the US market overall

772
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:24,809
is what's going to happen in 2016 so we

773
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:31,349
have a major election going to happen in

774
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:32,519
2016 with three actually four candidates

775
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,109
representing states that will have

776
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:36,240
initiatives on the ballot John Kasich

777
00:32:34,109 --> 00:32:39,929
from Ohio bush and Rubio from Florida

778
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,430
and Bernie Sanders from Vermont this is

779
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:43,590
gonna make the discussion about

780
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:46,500
marijuana more prominent and prevalent

781
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:48,269
in a way that we haven't had in a

782
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,549
generation and I can assure you by the

783
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:52,559
time you get to 2016 the idea of

784
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:55,349
marijuana legalization - effects on

785
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:58,529
society marijuana is the effect of the

786
00:32:55,349 --> 00:33:00,449
Prohibition regime is going to be part

787
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:02,970
of the public discourse in a way that we

788
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:05,279
have not seen yet and one of the

789
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:07,019
potentially interesting things about

790
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,359
that is that I think that could be

791
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:11,759
proved to be a catalyst in reshaping the

792
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:14,579
way we are approaching our federal

793
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,920
policy you may have seen yesterday this

794
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:21,689
article that came out that the DEA

795
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:23,850
spending $60 per plant to approve plants

796
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,920
in Oregon and people in are gonna sing

797
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:30,629
but it's legal why are we spending that

798
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:32,400
much money to address illegal grows the

799
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:35,360
national debate that's going to happen

800
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,160
during the presidential election will be

801
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,319
bringing these sorts of points about how

802
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,210
federal policy into lighting away that

803
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,009
it hasn't done before and I think that

804
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:48,750
could be one of the major catalysts for

805
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:52,349
change as we look at the years post 2016

806
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:55,859
and as you heard Tripp has bet MPPs

807
00:33:52,349 --> 00:34:00,179
as he $1,000 that there's going to be a

808
00:33:55,859 --> 00:34:02,609
federal pivot in 2017 some say 2019 but

809
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:06,169
it is coming and and that's going to

810
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:09,858
help really transform this industry

811
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:11,628
a second market Ohio and political

812
00:34:09,858 --> 00:34:14,480
circles does a statement that says as

813
00:34:11,628 --> 00:34:17,269
goes Ohio so goes the nation well as you

814
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,750
may know Ohio has a ballot initiative on

815
00:34:17,269 --> 00:34:21,619
the books for this November

816
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,599
somewhat controversial quite

817
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:26,419
controversial for some in that one of

818
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,669
the stipulations in it is that it limits

819
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:30,318
the number of licenses to ten producers

820
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:33,199
however despite the controversy

821
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:35,929
surrounding the the way they have

822
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,068
drafted the ballot initiative and we

823
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:39,619
think it has a very good likelihood of

824
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:41,719
passing there's a couple of things about

825
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,429
Ohio that make it unique it's going to

826
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:46,269
be the first state that has legalized

827
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:49,548
medical and recreational marijuana

828
00:34:46,269 --> 00:34:51,889
simultaneously now we forecast that by

829
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:54,648
2020 the Ohio market is going to be

830
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:57,019
generating 1.8 billion dollars in sales

831
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:59,389
that's slightly lower than responsible

832
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:01,639
house projection of 2.2 billion but

833
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:04,969
either way that's some very very serious

834
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:07,578
money and I think one of the outcomes of

835
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:09,828
Ohio is that we expect to see other

836
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:12,980
states that have a similar marijuana use

837
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:14,990
profile as Ohio to adopt similar

838
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,818
approaches to legalization so here we're

839
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:19,539
looking at states like Kentucky like

840
00:35:16,818 --> 00:35:22,460
Tennessee and the two Carolinas where

841
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:25,279
they don't have medical marijuana or if

842
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:28,369
they do it as a th a low THC high CBD

843
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,339
only program they're much more likely to

844
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:33,140
adopt the type of regime where it was a

845
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:36,889
group of investors who were designing a

846
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:38,358
ballot initiative that works to their

847
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:40,879
advantage rather than the more

848
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:44,409
egalitarian models that we have seen in

849
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:48,980
the marijuana programs adopted to date

850
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:52,219
third California the powerhouse stage I

851
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:54,048
think is an beautifully said la is the

852
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:57,289
biggest market and country in California

853
00:35:54,048 --> 00:36:01,548
is far and away the biggest state in the

854
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:04,099
country by our modeling we estimate the

855
00:36:01,548 --> 00:36:05,838
California's market this year alone the

856
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:07,609
medical market alone will generate two

857
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:10,298
and a half billion dollars in revenue

858
00:36:07,608 --> 00:36:16,639
which is half of the national total and

859
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:19,190
by 2020 that will have grown to over

860
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:23,059
five and a half billion

861
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:27,320
with expected legalization in 2016 and

862
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:30,380
the market coming online in 2020 now I

863
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,910
know we'll have in 2018 I know we're

864
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,079
gonna be discussing California in a

865
00:36:31,909 --> 00:36:34,219
little more detail here so don't want to

866
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,989
belabor the point but there's one aspect

867
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:38,119
as I was reading the proposed

868
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:40,599
legislation that really caught my eye

869
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:43,130
and that was on the creation of

870
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:46,339
standards for organic marijuana

871
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:47,599
certification California's going to be

872
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,300
the first state that's attempted this

873
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,860
and I think it will be a signal because

874
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:55,039
if the program is effective here other

875
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:57,470
states are gonna follow suit and as I

876
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,239
was thinking about what models we can

877
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:01,730
look at as analogies for what might

878
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:04,729
happen with Agana organic marijuana

879
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:07,090
standards I looked at American spirit

880
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:10,340
the tobacco company that's not owned by

881
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:14,720
r.j. Reynolds that offers natural and

882
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:17,450
organic cigarettes now the only

883
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,769
cigarette consumption has fallen fairly

884
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:20,480
dramatically over the past fifteen to

885
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:22,239
twenty years and that there's a

886
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,030
consistent in fairly strong trend

887
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:32,509
however American spirit sales have gone

888
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:34,760
from 260 million in 2009 to over 650

889
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:36,530
million last year

890
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,170
they're doing very very well then I have

891
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:40,610
2% of a market and this for a company

892
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,320
which one was founded people thought was

893
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,410
absolutely ridiculous that because who

894
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,090
is going to smoke organic cigarettes

895
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:49,759
this huge demand for this and I think

896
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:52,340
it's it's illustrative of the sort of

897
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:56,570
demand that we might expect to see for

898
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:58,370
organic cannabis and I think in

899
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:00,230
California the organic cannabis market

900
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:03,199
could it could be a small but

901
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:09,619
potentially very very lucrative segment

902
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:11,179
of the market forth Oregon organs a

903
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:13,250
particularly exciting market for a

904
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:15,710
couple of reasons one right now it's set

905
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,670
the lowest tax rate in the country and

906
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,220
there's a lot of states which are going

907
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,329
to be watching this quite closely our

908
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:24,319
analysis has shown that marijuana is

909
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:27,469
very price elastic which means that even

910
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:31,100
small changes in price will dramatically

911
00:38:27,469 --> 00:38:31,609
reduce demand now it's not that the

912
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:32,960
demand

913
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,670
goes away it just means that the man

914
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,220
stays in the black market I mean that's

915
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:40,309
the reality of it legal cannabis is

916
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:44,209
competing with the black market and so

917
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:46,489
when states set their taxes very high as

918
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:48,679
Washington did the ostensibly almost

919
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:50,659
guaranteeing that consumers who may want

920
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:52,669
to be active participating in the legal

921
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:54,589
market are being priced out of it

922
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,900
they're not going to be spending twice

923
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:59,720
the product what they have been spending

924
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:02,059
in the black markets by the Mart buy the

925
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:06,349
product from the legal market and this

926
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:09,079
is why Oregon's model is so interesting

927
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:11,539
at 17% it's the lowest tax rate in the

928
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:12,949
country and both Washington and

929
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:15,009
California are going to be watching very

930
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:18,169
closely how the market does from outset

931
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:21,470
because and we expect that demand is

932
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:24,289
going to be very very strong we will

933
00:39:21,469 --> 00:39:27,500
start to see states gradually lower

934
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:30,619
their tax rates because in one of the

935
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:33,079
paradoxical aspects of this industry the

936
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:34,909
lower tax rates the more tax rate tax

937
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:37,069
revenue you will generate because more

938
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:39,619
consumers will come into your stores to

939
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:44,710
buy legally as opposed to continuing to

940
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:48,469
buy from the black market and then v

941
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:50,949
Washington DC we actually based in DC so

942
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:53,719
we have a unique view into that market

943
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:55,519
and Washington is unique in a couple of

944
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:56,869
respects one it's it's the only

945
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,119
jurisdiction I believe in the world

946
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:01,699
where marijuana is completely legal for

947
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,469
adults to use and to cultivate but there

948
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:07,399
is no regulatory model by which you can

949
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:08,989
buy it and so earlier this year they had

950
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,910
a seed giveaway and apparently was the

951
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:13,069
largest seed giveaway that has ever been

952
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:15,139
held in the country and now all of the

953
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:16,340
product that folks went home and plant

954
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:18,019
into the basements is actually now

955
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:21,820
coming into the market when we're seeing

956
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:23,929
a graph of this product being sold

957
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,200
people are selling it even though

958
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:28,460
technically it's not legal but that's

959
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:31,399
unfortunately one of the byproducts of

960
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:33,769
congressional oversight we're not

961
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,139
allowed legally to set up a regulatory

962
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:37,670
framework and our council members have

963
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:40,519
been threatened will with Jane with jail

964
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:42,170
time if they spend any time even having

965
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:43,139
meetings discussing the possibility of a

966
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,460
regulatory frame

967
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:48,339
but Washington is important in another

968
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:52,269
respect as the nation's capital as a top

969
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:55,300
domestic tourist destination it's one of

970
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:57,610
the first places Americans are coming to

971
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:01,030
to end it's the first time they're in a

972
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:02,890
legal marijuana environment and you know

973
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,180
I spend a lot of time in the tourist

974
00:41:02,889 --> 00:41:05,710
destinations in Washington and so it's

975
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:08,230
interesting to hear people sound

976
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:11,380
completely gobsmacked that marijuana is

977
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:14,559
legal in the nation's capital Washington

978
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:16,869
is also the epicenter of public global

979
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,579
public diplomacy we have virtually all

980
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:20,019
of the country's embassies all of the

981
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:22,569
international embassies based there a

982
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:24,719
huge intimate international contingency

983
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:26,380
based in the city and you have

984
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:30,089
representatives from other countries who

985
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:33,730
are saying the United States has pegged

986
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:35,079
aid money cooperation and the

987
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:38,619
development of our strategic

988
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:40,690
partnerships on how strictly we enforce

989
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:44,259
marijuana prohibition in our country

990
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:47,019
whereas you u.s. continues to expand

991
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,220
marijuana legalization in fact I

992
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:50,110
speaking to someone in South America who

993
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:52,899
is complaining about this quite visibly

994
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:55,240
I think the fact that Washington is

995
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,250
legal means that it is going to be part

996
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:59,349
of this conversation that is going to

997
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:02,469
lead to a broader discussion globally

998
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:06,819
about marijuana public policy and I

999
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:09,609
think it's going to help begin this

1000
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:13,900
discussion about whether to dismantle

1001
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:16,720
our Convention on narcotics or whether

1002
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,760
to exclude marijuana from that given the

1003
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:22,089
size of the markets that we are seeing

1004
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,730
and as Amanda raman had said earlier in

1005
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:26,230
this market when California goes legal

1006
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,199
and be fully expect that it will

1007
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:32,889
countries like Mexico and and a lot of

1008
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:35,559
other countries which have long

1009
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:37,359
histories with marijuana but have made

1010
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:39,789
it illegal due to the rules that were

1011
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,740
imposed upon them by this narcotics

1012
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:43,989
regime will begin to push back against

1013
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:45,250
that which could catalyze a global

1014
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:48,669
market unlike anything we have seen

1015
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:53,579
before so a pause they're happy to

1016
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:53,579
discuss further thanks John Thanks

1017
00:42:54,139 --> 00:43:00,719
I'm told we need to wrap up but I wanna

1018
00:42:57,768 --> 00:43:03,389
but before doing that one I compose a

1019
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,699
question too to any of you and really

1020
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:09,179
you know as this market has evolved out

1021
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:11,548
of a from first a criminal marketed into

1022
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:13,558
kind of a gray market in this Wild West

1023
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:15,420
that we're still in in California and

1024
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,309
have been in in Colorado and other

1025
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,289
states so the unregulated markets one

1026
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:22,200
benefit of that is we've created these

1027
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:23,519
quintessential American success stories

1028
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:26,730
in the cannabis industry where you have

1029
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:28,318
world-class business is now operating

1030
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,358
that started with a couple pounds of

1031
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:34,079
product and a few thousand dollars and

1032
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:35,639
with the you know the current regime the

1033
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,450
current regime now that seems like those

1034
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:38,639
days are over

1035
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:41,389
and sometimes I know a lot of us are

1036
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:44,518
concerned that the opportunities for

1037
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:46,288
small entrepreneurs and mom and pops and

1038
00:43:44,518 --> 00:43:49,139
middle-class folks to get involved and

1039
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:51,960
get become successful in this industry

1040
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:54,298
are dwindling and I just want to ask

1041
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,338
those who have been around in all of the

1042
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:59,670
around the country what do you think

1043
00:43:56,338 --> 00:44:02,338
that there are still opportunities Aaron

1044
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:04,259
well yeah I would say that you know one

1045
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:06,480
thing about Los Angeles and I said there

1046
00:44:04,259 --> 00:44:08,309
was limited immunity that was about what

1047
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:13,559
happened was and it will probably never

1048
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:16,109
happen again but in 2007 in activists on

1049
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:18,240
Duncan from Americans for safe access he

1050
00:44:16,108 --> 00:44:20,400
floated a resolution and got a city

1051
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:23,189
council member to basically say anyone

1052
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,309
who comes forward can be registered with

1053
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:28,650
the city of La and 185 people came

1054
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:30,960
forward and they said okay no more no

1055
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:35,460
more and so I think those days are over

1056
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,500
but with the state legislation that was

1057
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,619
just or almost signed by the governor

1058
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:43,469
and probably will be this leaves a lot

1059
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:46,048
of opportunity in California still for

1060
00:44:43,469 --> 00:44:48,328
smaller players because it is a you have

1061
00:44:46,048 --> 00:44:50,670
to get your license locally you have to

1062
00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:52,410
convince your locality for it and it's

1063
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,079
an it's not like you're just applying at

1064
00:44:52,409 --> 00:44:58,139
the state so California when it comes to

1065
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:00,630
wineries when it comes to craft beer you

1066
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:03,420
have a very similar model and we believe

1067
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,970
maybe there's 50,000 growers in

1068
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,740
California and

1069
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:09,169
I'm also a member of the California

1070
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:11,598
Growers Association hopefully soon to be

1071
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:14,000
a board member and we are pushing to

1072
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,460
license tens of thousands of growers in

1073
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,889
the state so California is going to keep

1074
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:21,679
that tradition alive opposite of Ohio

1075
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:31,460
that wants to give the license to ten

1076
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:34,730
people I would say coming from Colorado

1077
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:37,400
that I work nationally and I'm in Denver

1078
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,539
now anytime I go to the East Coast I get

1079
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,119
off the plane and I have to remind

1080
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:42,769
myself I'm not in Kansas anymore I think

1081
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,890
the opportunity you know west of the

1082
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:48,530
Mississippi California Oregon Washington

1083
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:50,750
Colorado where we had very entrenched

1084
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:52,730
cannabis cultures that opportunity to

1085
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:54,559
still exist but when you go to the East

1086
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:56,510
Coast and there's only five people in

1087
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,809
New York who can get a license yeah I

1088
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:02,030
mean it's over so hold on hold on tight

1089
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:04,279
build what you can build now because

1090
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:08,480
this is one of the last few places where

1091
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:10,640
that mom-and-pop spirit can survive you

1092
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,650
know the ancillary entrepreneurship and

1093
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:15,529
finding a good product and a new idea

1094
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:17,660
that will always work but when you talk

1095
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:19,190
about you know micro wineries or micro

1096
00:46:17,659 --> 00:46:21,199
breweries those cost millions of dollars

1097
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:25,670
to start I mean you can't start a

1098
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:28,368
microbrew with a six-pack and $1000 so I

1099
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:31,760
mean it's it's it has evolved and it is

1100
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:35,240
kind of unfortunate but that is just

1101
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:38,570
yeah that's the way it's going I know in

1102
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:41,959
Connecticut where I'm from there's more

1103
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:45,349
and more there's added expansion in

1104
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,030
other counties there's probably you know

1105
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:49,010
I don't know how many more licenses are

1106
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:50,990
on the table right now

1107
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:53,380
and you know I think the what will

1108
00:46:50,989 --> 00:46:56,059
happen to is they'll be looking for

1109
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:58,700
different types of products to stock on

1110
00:46:56,059 --> 00:47:01,639
their shelves in these dispensaries so

1111
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:03,588
there's the innovative opportunity that

1112
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:07,029
will transpire in Connecticut further

1113
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:09,858
and you know New York is you know very a

1114
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:12,680
unique animal I think it will its baby

1115
00:47:09,858 --> 00:47:14,329
steps right now and eventually the

1116
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:16,119
products will become more widely

1117
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:21,059
available and

1118
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:21,059
more abundant in terms of selection

1119
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:28,800
Thanks well I'm told we are out of time

1120
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:28,800
but the panelists will be around
