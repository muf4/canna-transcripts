1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,629
one thing I will say because of my

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,080
expense in the CCA that the one thing

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:10,710
where labs and manufacturers come come

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,469
together on is is where testing happens

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,719
right so in a lot of industries right

6
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:19,259
especially Pharma right so you don't

7
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:21,509
test the product in its final package

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,480
right you test the product in its final

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,240
form right but you can be delivered that

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,849
final form in bulk to test its

11
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,229
quarantine until I get the coa and then

12
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,079
everything's hunky-dory and you release

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,058
it then they can package it and go right

14
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:39,320
in our industry we have to receive it in

15
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:42,030
its final package right which means

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,390
childproof packaging blister packaging

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,689
oh and great babe cartridges dude it

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,859
takes to get enough sample and we're

19
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:52,259
only talking like two and a half or

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,789
three grams total right all right so we

21
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,859
got to go through especially if it's

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,689
half gram cartridges well you can only

23
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:58,799
get two tenths of a gram maybe three

24
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:00,210
tenths of a gram I'm out of a half-game

25
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,030
cartridge right so if I'm trying to get

26
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,820
three grams right that's how I'm looking

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,439
at 10 to 15 cartridges that have to be

28
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,069
opened well that's about 30 minutes of

29
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:14,639
time so now I charge my customers labor

30
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:17,399
right for that kind of stuff I have to

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,159
all right otherwise I don't make back my

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,670
margin on my tests and it's not fair to

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,320
them it's not fair to us but it's the

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,530
way the regular regulations are written

35
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,508
and it's just one of those things where

36
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:33,450
manufacturers are pushing for testing at

37
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,299
final at final formulation or final

38
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,799
product but not final package the lab

39
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,500
has been screaming about this for two

40
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,630
frickin years dude because before they

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,000
went into the the real rights wanted to

42
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:48,298
effect this the past year or you know

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,759
the year before under the the temporary

44
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,710
you know practice regs was still in

45
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,118
cartridges right and we were still

46
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:56,539
complaining back then two years ago

47
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:56,540
right
