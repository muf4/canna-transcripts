1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,078
mm-hmm

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:20,160
[Music]

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,719
and then I when the sting was gone I

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,100
went back because they had got me for a

5
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,599
you know I had been collecting for a

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,300
long time at that point

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,039
and they got a collection that I would

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,099
put against anybody's collection today

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,660
in terms of sheer quality of plants like

10
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,000
that was that was real because I was

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,979
touching all the older people that were

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,558
getting out of cannabis and they would

13
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:43,738
allow me to access it in the whole year

14
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:46,039
one off that one Farm had for that and

15
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,238
that made that one Farm Service

16
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,640
and everybody would go to them first

17
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,919
yeah so I never I haven't been able to

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,960
Humble Legacy but the main point of any

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,640
of these funds isn't so much that you're

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,520
going to be first it's and it's not

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,219
about your ego about like I'm doing it

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,198
you're sharing your excitement that's

23
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,478
love it's passion yeah you're hunting

24
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:08,819
and that what you're trying to do is

25
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,519
you're trying to encourage like for me I

26
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:15,478
know my role because I know that I I've

27
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:18,118
got 40 40 odd years here now in canvas

28
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:21,060
we can't go on forever I'm going to get

29
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,500
old and fucking die and so what you what

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,060
you and I look I learned this from this

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
old martial artist too with this old

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,200
martial artist I met was talking about

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,299
you know why he created this program to

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,460
find the new Master for his Kung Fu

35
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,640
world because he said I'm thinking about

36
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,919
death which means my time is coming and

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,680
I have to create the future and what I

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,259
have to do is I have to help build the

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,659
future I want to see and the future that

40
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,618
I wanted to see was that people

41
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,960
interested in chasing their desire right

42
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:53,819
so like half the shit that I do has

43
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,459
nothing to fucking do with anybody but

44
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:59,219
me all the all the projects that we'll

45
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:01,139
talk about publicly are mine

46
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,519
the ones that I don't talk about are the

47
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,159
ones that I work with the global

48
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,959
operations because I'm on Andes right so

49
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,399
I don't talk about those because they

50
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,318
don't want the information revealed this

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,060
is the system and and those in their

52
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,159
facilities there's so much going on

53
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,080
internationally that the US is being

54
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,000
really left behind in a lot of ways

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,760
within what's happening like not from a

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,340
genetic standpoint but from just like a

57
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:27,060
global economy it's amazing what like

58
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,659
Jamaica Canada Germany Switzerland South

59
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,659
Africa

60
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:39,239
because it's usury the American system

61
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,919
the American system is different because

62
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,819
every all the drugs in the world end up

63
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,679
in America

64
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:45,659
so Americans if you're not selling in

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,580
America you're not selling when you sell

66
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:49,560
into Europe like when we're moving herb

67
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,060
to other countries we're moving 200 250

68
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,340
kilograms at a time and that's a big

69
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,560
fucking load yeah the vacuum is still

70
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,780
Paladin I'll show you a picture yeah

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,620
there we go

72
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,620
oh my God pictures

73
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:16,759
moving into another legal country

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,640
and so that's a big deal right

75
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,259
that's not a big deal when like my young

76
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,279
partner Gabe was probably moving you

77
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,799
know I don't know fucking thousand

78
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,239
pounds every 10 days for years out of

79
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,400
the neighborhood

80
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,200
um when you know kids that were 17 that

81
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,239
were moving a thousand pounds at a time

82
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,639
300 400 500 pounds isn't a big fucking

83
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,620
deal when Germany announced big deal is

84
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,899
it's Crossing legally Crossing

85
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,420
International line that's the big deal

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,299
no no I understand that the reality is

87
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:50,518
how much money is being made

88
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,260
it's small quantities of these pieces

89
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,000
when wherever's moving from Portugal to

90
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,679
Israel when it's moving from Canada to

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,299
Australia and it's moving internally

92
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,299
from Colombia to Europe

93
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:05,579
it's it's business but the quantity of

94
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,400
consumption isn't like the consumption

95
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,040
quantity in the United States the U.S

96
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,900
Burns a lot of herb if you're selling

97
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,039
cocaine you're selling more cocaine in

98
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,798
America than anywhere else in the

99
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,959
fucking world you're selling any drugs

100
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,459
I guarantee we're taking more Fentanyl

101
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,459
and meth than any other anybody else

102
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:32,939
it doesn't mean that that we own

103
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,799
anything or better in any way it just

104
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,100
means that our population is drug

105
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,100
addiction

106
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,418
we like a lot of drugs and

107
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:47,099
the the thing is that when you're moving

108
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,539
to these other places these markets are

109
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,639
smaller but what they do is they let you

110
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,740
understand the relationships between

111
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,180
premises that we have built here and

112
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,418
premises that we can see hold true

113
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,459
around the world and we can see Regional

114
00:04:56,418 --> 00:05:01,799
and and

115
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:04,560
demographic identities that want certain

116
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,879
things in very specific ways if you are

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,740
if you're messing around in certain

118
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,500
parts of the world all cannabis is

119
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,379
consumed with tobacco it's either almost

120
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,600
no one is

121
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:19,500
interesting watching that specific

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,479
kind of usage kind of change as as

123
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,220
legalization comes through and the price

124
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,199
of herb goes down and the acceptance

125
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,639
gets better like like I don't think

126
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,620
you're ever going to get drugs from

127
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,879
Spain to fully give up their tobacco

128
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,879
it's not about the order

129
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:37,319
because it is real I learned the truth

130
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:40,859
of this one the herb produced in these

131
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,659
regions doesn't produce enough wax

132
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,479
there's no need for the plant to create

133
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,539
the anti-desicant because it's too moist

134
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:51,680
and so what you end up having

135
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:54,560
this weed that doesn't want to work

136
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,120
no that's um

137
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,519
the weed doesn't want to burn well and

138
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,740
so what I did I said and I every place I

139
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,079
traveled I'm Gonna Roll that up I have

140
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,620
them I have the the people in it kind of

141
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,620
scared of this stuff

142
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,400
strong strong yeah

143
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:17,099
I like to keep myself to like three bomb

144
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:20,120
hits and if I do anymore that's when

145
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:24,919
like I start to get into that like real

146
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,918
anxiety totally like heart palpitations

147
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:30,418
I guess I got so high on some hash that

148
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,919
I I was doing some hash research you

149
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:33,959
know like I was I was doing reading and

150
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,399
I was looking for rosin lines can't look

151
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,579
at people in the eye I can't find your

152
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,579
words

153
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,459
and I was questioning my ability to

154
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,319
function at that level of like do I have

155
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,000
the ability to actually use the tool and

156
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,160
I'm laughing because oh I have the

157
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,180
ability I want to eat a part

158
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,039
and I had to like get myself emotionally

159
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,680
stable and I was cracking up so I'm like

160
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,659
oh I'm fucked up right now this stuff is

161
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,918
real and then I went in the garage to go

162
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,020
get my tools

163
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,939
and then forgot why I was there and then

164
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:07,258
started to question I'm lost and I'm

165
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:08,579
like no I'm not lost I'm lost because I

166
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,160
can't find my fucking tools what do I do

167
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:13,560
now what do I do now it's so funny when

168
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,240
I do that and I get to like I'll go from

169
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,500
one room to the other and I'll just be

170
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,300
like but I don't remember where I was

171
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,038
supposed to come here and then I'll have

172
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,660
a good idea to go into a different room

173
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,000
to do something else by the time I get

174
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,620
into that room then you also forget I

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,339
just keep going from like ruin your room

176
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:32,660
oh fuck knock your fucking done those

177
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:32,659
hides are piddling streams

178
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,240
but you know but if we would answer

179
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:50,039
look at this

180
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,299
what should a farmer grow that's growing

181
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:53,038
for other people or what should like the

182
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,900
average Backyard Farmer well the average

183
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,339
Backyard Farmer who's getting as is the

184
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,439
most options they've ever had in history

185
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:01,019
because seeds are legal now so the

186
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,660
ability for you to to access seed stock

187
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:06,000
is phenomenal and so what you what you

188
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,680
want to do as an individual wants to

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,180
experiment cannabis is you want to be

190
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,918
able to say okay what is it that I want

191
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,439
this canvas what am I looking for yeah

192
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:15,359
what am I looking for and then ideally

193
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,519
you would look for someone who was doing

194
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,759
the work in a similar climactic

195
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:24,598
situations yourself so I know that if

196
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:27,500
I'm or at least have the data to help

197
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,519
inform your house if I

198
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,560
it'd be nice if you would do in the

199
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,899
greenhouse work because then what I know

200
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,240
is the stock you chose worked in that

201
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,679
higher humidity environment if you

202
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,918
worked in you said you were doing

203
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,778
Outdoors it lets me know

204
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:45,299
that it's resistant enough to the forces

205
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:47,899
of outdoor where some rainfall and some

206
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:51,240
wind is not going to fall apart

207
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,820
so and then what I would recommend for

208
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,039
you know the average individual is to

209
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,200
you know get some diversity in what

210
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,659
they're doing and if you have

211
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,220
uh you know six that you can do in your

212
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:04,139
yard and you have six that your neighbor

213
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,240
can do great that gives you that gives

214
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,980
you a possibility of 12. that's the

215
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,419
funnest part back in the day is like

216
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,000
trading if you're home he was like Hey I

217
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,259
did this what did you do just like

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,580
Auntie your uncle come through and

219
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,919
they're like man I got this old

220
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,300
craftsman forever girl you know oh and

221
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:20,519
that that way what that does it lets you

222
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:23,338
enjoy you know the cultivation process

223
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,419
and it allows you to steer in the

224
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,160
directions you want because everything

225
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:28,799
is choosing your own adventure and then

226
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:31,740
what you do is you go online into forums

227
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:34,019
or you listen to podcasts of uh people

228
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,399
that are about it and then you start to

229
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,379
be able to make connections with people

230
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,139
about hey that seems to be where I'd

231
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:43,799
like to try and enjoy those flavors so

232
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:46,259
as a specific case study my friend in

233
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:49,319
California so I was like look at this

234
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:53,338
menu of hot dog Haze hazes and Hayden

235
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,080
crosses and uh let me know what yeah you

236
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,820
might want to run we'll say could you

237
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,200
find out which has the best so he's

238
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,778
trying to decide

239
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,879
like do I do long flowering stuff for

240
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:04,439
the California market so he said can you

241
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,360
find out which has the best structure

242
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,240
and it's not crazy long on the flower

243
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,399
time while still I mean that really hay

244
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,440
smell and high type I know that sounds

245
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,419
like a unicorn but as a grower that is

246
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,940
what I am looking for you know if she

247
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:20,939
like if you go like to Haze and into

248
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,860
like like a m91 right because a little

249
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,779
longer not like like a cat four it's a

250
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,700
little shorter

251
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:30,480
and you can go into that into like like

252
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:32,180
an F2 you can pull out stuff that's

253
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,940
containing

254
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:38,939
a little bit better blood solidity

255
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,399
and the the high is a little bit more

256
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,640
rounded because most people when you get

257
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,700
right down to it they don't really know

258
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,500
what real

259
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,720
equatorial is like what they want is

260
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,799
they want to uplift them but when you

261
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,660
give them something that makes them

262
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,419
question their fucking validity they

263
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:59,639
don't and they're looking at in a jar

264
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,559
like what is this

265
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,078
right and like I just so it's very

266
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,458
certain type that likes this and and I

267
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,439
have to play with it at the right time

268
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:09,419
too needing that like I mean it's

269
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,459
Pharaoh weed it's primordial it's just

270
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,979
like this is the building blocks of all

271
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:16,259
of it oh this is foundation herb and

272
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,000
what we what we know is that you have to

273
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,100
match it to the right time and what I

274
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,220
know too is from like fucking with the

275
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,620
Colombians their view on cannabis is one

276
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,200
of that when you go into broadleaf City

277
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,480
it pollutes your cannabinoid system with

278
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,959
adulterants that prohibits you from

279
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,480
uptaking Daryl Leaf cerebral effects to

280
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,859
the maximum advantage and so they

281
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,778
recommended to me this was an old

282
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,759
Columbia dude that was a collector and

283
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:43,679
it was killing to talk to him because he

284
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,139
collected everything from their parents

285
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,599
his collection was all over South

286
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:50,399
America Central America he was the only

287
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,220
person ever met that went that route and

288
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,179
he lived in Colombia and he and I get

289
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,560
together Malibu guys

290
00:11:56,179 --> 00:12:02,299
this is this is fucking like Colombian

291
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:06,179
Jorge and and but this guy

292
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:08,819
who's giving me an education about

293
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:11,219
how they saw the relationship between

294
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,200
the products not from the lab point of

295
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,959
view but from Human point of views yeah

296
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,079
experiential yeah cultural communities

297
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:21,000
like that's what that's what like the

298
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,278
most interest is me about like world

299
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,200
like Global cannabis populations is the

300
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,000
cultures that have grown up around them

301
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,399
and how those cultures have developed

302
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,259
independently from like one even like

303
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,659
you go to the parts of Africa like one

304
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:35,700
Village under another Village slightly

305
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:37,559
different variations they're really the

306
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,278
same in terms of

307
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:46,559
people that burn are in general a little

308
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:48,120
cooler like in general but not smoke

309
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,859
yeah like there's never been a place no

310
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,459
matter where you go in the world that I

311
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,740
don't notice it's something about herbs

312
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:58,638
it softens everyone

313
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:03,379
wear like alcohol like like

314
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,379
it turns it up to 11.

315
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,839
a lot of that was really like normal

316
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:14,819
like fives hazes so you had a little bit

317
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,100
later yeah they laid them they laid

318
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,420
these because you can't cultivate any of

319
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,500
these true mazes those are like the

320
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:21,559
modern those are a little bit more

321
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,578
domesticated

322
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:25,559
you know I think it was like you know

323
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:27,239
three to five percent is what you want

324
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:31,099
the Northern Lights influence to be oh

325
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,100
shit oh yeah do we have another battery

326
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,680
hold on hold on

327
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:39,919
I'm sure you can edit it splice it in

328
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,919
like jeans

329
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,299
it's a whole nother level

330
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:54,899
they're every day they're

331
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:59,000
taking more larger and larger snips

332
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:59,000
I've got a good backup track too yeah

333
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,600
okay

334
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,200
and where are we going with that oh we

335
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,519
were talking about um

336
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,000
and bringing and bringing and bring in

337
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,940
these uh broadly genes in to make them

338
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,519
a workable indoor and then it just came

339
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,079
down to selection and the the

340
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,940
foundations of some of these modern

341
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,638
hazes that you see in almost all things

342
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,079
are either Haze or Haze C I mean that's

343
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,700
it's really like there's only those

344
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,199
couple cuts that got released into the

345
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,420
world at any quantity that everybody

346
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,800
copied and followed now we've been

347
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:36,719
playing with the like the haze

348
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,399
turpinelian dominant stuff for a little

349
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,680
while like a lot more like kind of like

350
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,360
the train wreck end of things and

351
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,578
training is interesting too that was

352
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,259
bringing in like a nice bud structure

353
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:47,698
yeah yeah there's a visual appeal that

354
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:49,559
train Rick had that was stunning the

355
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:52,078
Hella jelly it's like it's like the

356
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,778
modernized kind of like hazy like with

357
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,039
like some Jam jelly notes up front I

358
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:57,539
don't think I've smoked a hell of jelly

359
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:59,159
off to check any with you yeah I got

360
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:00,659
some in there let me go burn a joining

361
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,458
because I heard some good stuff about

362
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:04,379
the Hella jelly too no it's it's

363
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,299
beautiful and it looks like a like a

364
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,179
beautiful sativa it's a long fairly long

365
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:11,519
flower time but short for a sativa

366
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:14,458
defined defined fairly long like 84

367
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,720
under 100 well under 100 well well under

368
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,059
her totally commercial commercially

369
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,740
viable yeah that you could Harvest it in

370
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:21,979
like October it triggers really early oh

371
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,839
nice nice

372
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,940
totally stretches all there yeah so you

373
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,860
still get these monstrous like Spears of

374
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,360
jaw forming yeah that's the issue with

375
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,000
like what I when I learned when I first

376
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,800
started working with Haze is indoor was

377
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,198
that I learned that if I ran in that at

378
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,179
12 12 what I got was 70 days of

379
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,679
transition and then 70 days of flour

380
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,259
yeah because it's a few minutes that

381
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:46,019
really means yeah

382
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:47,419
I run I run them like 10. I go 10 14. go

383
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:51,179
to flower please

384
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:53,099
and then and then once I set them then I

385
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:55,319
can either bring up the cycle a tiny bit

386
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,639
or I can leave it as it happened outside

387
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,920
because you can figure out that figuring

388
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,480
out Trigger Time yeah I trigger them

389
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,219
indoors and then bring them up reel back

390
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,039
that trigger time you can get some

391
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,720
really nice sativas to finish like by

392
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,759
like a normal like Northern California

393
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,040
Harvest Time yeah we used to I used to

394
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,838
spend more time doing that shit just

395
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,338
because you know you're freaking on your

396
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,019
own little fucking thing but I used to

397
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,899
set up all the plants and then run them

398
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,459
on what was the late hours I expected at

399
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,958
these times in order to get a finish

400
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,698
that I chose so I knew if it took me 70

401
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:26,518
days to finish it I had to go back 70

402
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:28,139
days 70 days and then say what's my

403
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,299
trigger time here and then I would set

404
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:32,879
the trigger on the in the rooms and say

405
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:34,198
okay what triggers at this lighting and

406
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,759
because we you know we learned you're

407
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:37,078
doing that kind of work though like

408
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,939
working with trigger times you can

409
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:41,039
create streams that are like or

410
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,139
varieties that are you know they work on

411
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,819
the equator in one way they work in

412
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,560
California in a different way and then

413
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,480
they can work in Canada yes they're

414
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,679
tools as long as they trigger at the

415
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,379
right amount of time you can fit them

416
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:55,679
into it varieties now that is they'll

417
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:57,299
flower under 19 hours of light under 24

418
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,879
hours of light they're totally fine

419
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:02,159
vegging away it's only 19 hours

420
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:04,380
full flower quick flour too like six

421
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,838
weeks so like being able to take that

422
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,400
those kinds of traits into like sativas

423
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:09,599
and bring them up to Canada or the

424
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,819
Northern Lights would be incredible yeah

425
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,779
yeah and it opens up the market yeah

426
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:15,899
that's what I'm trying to play around

427
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:17,699
with some of this Lebanese work that uh

428
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,000
Bob's work with that Lebanese that red

429
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,740
lab cut into his talk was just so the

430
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,980
quality of that flower was phenomenal

431
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,660
and I was like that's a hybrid and it

432
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,579
just made me maybe get kind of caught up

433
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,679
in Lebanon again for a second then I

434
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:33,960
realized I had Lebanese stop chilling

435
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,940
and I was just like you know what let me

436
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,058
let me see if I can bring some of these

437
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,980
early triggering genes in so that I can

438
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,319
start having stuff that's coming in and

439
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,640
that you know first of September that's

440
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:47,159
when it's finished

441
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,900
and that's how the Willy G's Lebanese

442
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,940
was it was trigger early it would bring

443
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,919
it would come in early it was a lot like

444
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,360
this as far as the nose and some of the

445
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,799
structure

446
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,058
yeah I know there's there's you got to

447
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:58,319
go that's the whole thing is that with

448
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:59,819
what I learned from any of these big

449
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,619
open like when I'm looking at

450
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,599
populations of plants that were grown in

451
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:04,798
fields because they're taking a whole

452
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,659
crop

453
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,000
they're not worrying about like outlier

454
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,679
profile they'll select outliers and make

455
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,660
sure those seeds make it back into the

456
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,820
seed batch but they catch as much as

457
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,000
they can so that they're always getting

458
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:18,960
a diversity of survivability

459
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,759
one year to the next yeah but you're

460
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,679
getting a homogenized profile because

461
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:24,720
you're blending everything we don't do

462
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,759
that here and so I just know that

463
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,740
families those are like family groups

464
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:30,798
yes yeah and so when I go to the

465
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:34,980
different Villages

466
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:36,418
what they steered yeah same gene pool is

467
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,519
slightly different than another Valley

468
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,740
do they irrigate what kind of dung do

469
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,139
they use what's that what's their what's

470
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,000
their soil PH like all this weird little

471
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,820
cultural backgrounds and stuff it's

472
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,599
amazing yeah cannabis is such like a

473
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:53,879
fixture of like human culture it's like

474
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,558
it's astounding like that's one my

475
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,260
greatest wish into the future is that

476
00:18:55,558 --> 00:19:00,058
everyone really realizes like how deep

477
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:02,339
our connection has gone with this and

478
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:03,899
why yes because there's so many

479
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:05,759
different things out there that like

480
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,080
I've treated different populations for

481
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,940
different reasons that we can't even

482
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,740
like begin to scratch the surface of

483
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,480
understanding it

484
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,200
yeah because we're trying too hard to

485
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,640
understand they just consumed and used

486
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,640
to put a bunch of THC as well

487
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,279
I want to say the gene that that is

488
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,140
control for tries to get rid of that

489
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:29,700
Gene the dream that's involved in this

490
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,500
give her to that Gene my whole problem

491
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,179
with with crispr tech and it's the only

492
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,619
thing I have issue with like I know why

493
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:37,019
they use it and it lets you do some

494
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:38,279
really incredible manipulations that and

495
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:40,440
they just started what's a great tool

496
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,960
for research EU well the EU just said

497
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,779
crispr food is okay without looking at

498
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,700
crispr as as GMO and because it's really

499
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:49,859
not GMO because you're not adding a

500
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,360
dissimilar organism to the genome but

501
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:52,798
what you're doing though to me that I

502
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,538
that I worry about with cannabis

503
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,058
specifically is

504
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:59,400
for as much when I when I was I was in

505
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:01,678
the hospital a couple years ago when I

506
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,720
when I was I got out of this coma the

507
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,340
ICU staff told me that they said you

508
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,319
know they go you have that best set of

509
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,119
lungs we've ever seen in the hospital

510
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:11,460
they said you obviously never smoked a

511
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,959
day in your life and I and I looked at

512
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,640
her and I was like I just didn't have

513
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,840
the heart to tell her just how wrong

514
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,480
they were

515
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,558
but it also let me realize because in

516
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,179
all these years we've been wondering

517
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:23,038
like what are we doing to ourselves at

518
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,538
the level of consumption we've had well

519
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,720
you've been smoking weed for 40 years

520
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:29,519
and you were smoking a lot of weed my

521
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,960
lungs shouldn't have this level of

522
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,819
quality even though I'm an endurance

523
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,919
athlete right so I spend my time doing

524
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,139
endurance athlete shit

525
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,059
um with all the smoking I'm doing it

526
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,400
should be hindered but they were like

527
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:44,339
the quality of your lung As We examined

528
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,200
you in this ICU was unbelievable and so

529
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:48,538
what I know is that nobody can smoke

530
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,740
cigarettes for 40 years and have no lung

531
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,298
issues

532
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,759
and you're going to tell me that

533
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:58,019
cannabis has any less tar or any less

534
00:20:53,759 --> 00:21:00,359
volatile compounds it's it's it's it's I

535
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:02,879
to me it's other it's other genes that

536
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:06,079
are present that create an effect that

537
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,600
somehow negates the cancerous properties

538
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:11,819
MIT figured this out like a few like a

539
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,439
decade ago um it was a they're

540
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:15,240
researching the difference why people

541
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,400
are getting cancer from tobacco smoke

542
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,859
and why they weren't seeing that it's

543
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,320
the same and what was the shape of what

544
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:25,019
uh the actually the shape of the tar and

545
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,519
how like the molecule of smoke the

546
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:29,220
molecules that are in there how they're

547
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:31,740
shaped and in uh cannabis they're shaped

548
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,460
like you know like a dye from like uh

549
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:37,099
yeah Dungeons and Dragons like a like

550
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,419
each ten-sided die

551
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:41,759
32-sided dies like it was like it was

552
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:43,440
like a dodecahedron or whatever and then

553
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,940
the Cannabis was shaped like or uh sorry

554
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,400
cigarettes were pink shaped like a

555
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,558
sickle gotcha tobacco is more irritating

556
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,519
actually embeds itself in because of

557
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:54,658
that because of that property

558
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,400
and so because it's actually technically

559
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,260
I think more toxins yeah no that's what

560
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,360
I'm saying

561
00:21:57,259 --> 00:22:02,279
is more more toxic and we have no

562
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:03,899
filtration in it and I mean but it just

563
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,279
does it just doesn't go on the inside it

564
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,360
doesn't seem to bind and so familiar

565
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,859
that's why they say smoke them together

566
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:09,479
is bad but that's new research coming

567
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,399
out saying that that's not necessarily

568
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,259
true so I worry about crispr just

569
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,640
because what I know is that and it's the

570
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:18,720
same reason why they worry about it with

571
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,000
food is that the scientists on one

572
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,140
faction say there's no issue but the

573
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,880
other scientists who are just as

574
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,740
educated on the other side say yeah we

575
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,440
have concern so you don't really know

576
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,720
where to stand with sometimes returning

577
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,519
things we don't really understand why

578
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,900
and it's not and it's not collateral

579
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,759
damage well it's not just a switch

580
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,159
either if you've got linkage and drag

581
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,079
and when you're doing like when I'm

582
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,700
gonna switch it's a chunk it's like yeah

583
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,399
it's it's just you're taking books out

584
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,679
of the novel yes and you're also not

585
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,200
understanding the relationship that has

586
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,600
in conjunction with other genes that

587
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,460
really only like machine learning can

588
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,558
tell you because what you're able to do

589
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,659
is look at 100 000 samples and say you

590
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:59,639
know what the machine says that this

591
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:02,460
Gene combination is what is occurring

592
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,799
not just that one Gene and loci we yes

593
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,019
we've located the gene that controls a

594
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,418
certain thing but when we manipulate it

595
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:11,220
we don't get the expected result which

596
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,259
means that there's modulating effects

597
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,419
from other genes that we aren't aware of

598
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:18,240
because we don't see the pathway

599
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,460
and so when you're that's really what

600
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,259
machine learning does in breeding is

601
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,659
that when you're when you use an AI

602
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:27,119
you're able to ask the computer what

603
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:30,240
patterns do you see that are consistent

604
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:33,239
with the plants we want to use and that

605
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,298
now gives you a true pattern to look at

606
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,759
genomically which which parents should

607
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:40,798
we use in the breeding project and why

608
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:42,538
and we can do it mathematically we see

609
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,700
this sequence of alleles that is yeah

610
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:46,379
but it's dictated to notify but we go

611
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,419
from looking at like we can look at like

612
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,360
a thousand a machine learning operation

613
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:53,940
can look at 900 million so you can go up

614
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,178
to 900 million combinations to

615
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,100
understand the universities

616
00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:01,380
for the book of 900 million but the but

617
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:03,719
the computer at least lets us see the

618
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,659
patterning and so what it says is that

619
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,000
the ones that we chose for some reason

620
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:10,500
they seem to have this patterning we can

621
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
go through a bigger population and pull

622
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,099
that out and move them forward and we go

623
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,079
with success which is really how we

624
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:18,178
breed anyways it's just you're using

625
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,279
tools just like we use in genomic

626
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:22,320
breeding to figure out what alleles are

627
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:25,019
present what aren't present

628
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:28,079
machine learning lets you look at a

629
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:30,179
billion different locations and say what

630
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:32,158
is the bigger pattern so we're still

631
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,380
working on little patterns because

632
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,880
that's our level of understanding but

633
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,380
the machine can look at much bigger

634
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,159
patterns and

635
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:44,640
starts to be able to really create some

636
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,440
incredible potentials of what if you

637
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,960
know when you're using what is this why

638
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,200
are we seeing this grouping and also

639
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,419
what's possible if we if we ask the

640
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,480
plant when you look at the gene

641
00:24:54,419 --> 00:25:00,059
patterning what is possible from these

642
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,279
parents and it starts to be able to tell

643
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:04,379
you and help you understand what's the

644
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:06,000
potential outcome see we can only

645
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,860
predict it based off of what we believe

646
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,659
is an outcome but when you're able to

647
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:11,639
put a billion combinations in you see

648
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,919
yeah look back generations and find

649
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,600
patterns and things that yeah would be

650
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,280
impossible for a human to ever perceive

651
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,538
yeah no one can do it without we still

652
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,298
have the ability but we could be

653
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:22,679
generational yes

654
00:25:20,298 --> 00:25:23,879
like you know based on the Cannabis

655
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,798
right now like

656
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,360
we're working on it's all generational

657
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:29,519
stuff there's been some books there's

658
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,319
been a lot of like new research coming

659
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,298
out but a lot of the understanding and

660
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,038
knowledge it's still just Word of Mouth

661
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:36,538
generation what you learned from your

662
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:38,400
folks and what your folks learn from

663
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:40,039
their folks and half it's wrong so half

664
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,960
the stuff okay because yeah

665
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:45,119
[Music]

666
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,360
so I know I know what I see

667
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,979
and I know what I do and then I I'm

668
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:51,839
fortunate that I get to be around people

669
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,400
that that are really brilliant so I'm

670
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:56,399
able to like you know learn from their

671
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,440
experiences but the further the down the

672
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,480
rabbit hole we go the more I know we

673
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,460
don't know yeah right yeah it just

674
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,900
doesn't stop I remember when some uh

675
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,519
geneticists we were working with really

676
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,140
early on they came into cannabis and

677
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,460
they were like man we're really like we

678
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,679
think we're going to identify these

679
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,140
problems it was like some like a disease

680
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,940
stuff it was like it was like CBD

681
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,038
production THC production like we're

682
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,798
going to knock these out and be done and

683
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,960
then they got into it and really quickly

684
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:24,058
the head to notices came back it was

685
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,579
just like man there's like Generations

686
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:28,859
work of like worth of work to do on the

687
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:31,678
Cannabis genome from like a practical

688
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:33,359
perspective and it's going to take like

689
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,278
this is going to take so much human

690
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,319
endeavor to actually like bring us to

691
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,900
modernize cannabis the way we've we've

692
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:42,778
done with every other crop that we grow

693
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,640
right now and and when in the in the the

694
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:45,960
fun part about that one too is that when

695
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,278
they're talking about what they're going

696
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,079
to do with cannabis they're still

697
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,019
looking at it as a plant

698
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:56,099
measurable by numbers

699
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:58,798
and it's the only plant we really play

700
00:26:56,099 --> 00:27:00,899
with that has so many complex

701
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,940
relationships with us that it almost you

702
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,400
have to have human evaluators you can

703
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,679
get a population neck down but I don't

704
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,880
think you can neck it

705
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:14,038
it's rare that I see the lab hand me

706
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,559
something that is better than someone

707
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:19,140
who sifted it out of their bedroom yes

708
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,000
they have better traits that are are

709
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,460
valuable and how we produce it where

710
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,919
it's you know quicker growth with that

711
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,798
resistance is all about but the

712
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,020
selection process so like the people

713
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,058
that I get herb from that I play with I

714
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:34,200
work with global monsters I smoke weed

715
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:36,259
from people that have grown and out of

716
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,000
the basements

717
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:40,619
you can't really deny it you know and so

718
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,359
it I know that there's going to be this

719
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:44,759
Nexus at some point

720
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,139
but do you think do you think it'll come

721
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:47,960
together or do you think it'll fraction

722
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,278
you do you think there'll be this like

723
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,200
pharmacopoeia like pharmaceutical level

724
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:54,720
production that's just like kind of this

725
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,298
insulated little bubble and then they'll

726
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,339
be like all kind of like all that like

727
00:27:56,298 --> 00:28:01,679
cosmetics and like vape pen even a vape

728
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:04,079
pen is just like kind of super isolate

729
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,419
for really restrictive areas and then

730
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,158
there'll be this like just this Niche

731
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,020
that is kind of like the rest of like

732
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,820
this the normal smoke or like we'll

733
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:13,558
experienced smoker the normal smoker

734
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:16,859
though that the thing is what I believe

735
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:19,259
is that when you create the toolbox

736
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:20,459
then it's available right so you've

737
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:22,079
never come together you think they're

738
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,860
going to be like well well you're going

739
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,178
to have you oh you're going to

740
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:26,339
definitely have multiple markets but

741
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:28,380
what I mean coming together is that the

742
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:29,759
small Operator just like right now right

743
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,580
small operators getting buried alive

744
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,579
small operator can get access to TC get

745
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:38,220
the plants clean held and banked your

746
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:40,980
your benefit from from a technology that

747
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,079
save your life that's not bad so to me

748
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:46,679
that's the modern science of micro

749
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:48,899
propagation going along with small

750
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,759
people and you are also now able to go

751
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,380
take classes so you can learn how to do

752
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:54,778
your own preservation so if you actually

753
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,640
just because you cut a meristem and and

754
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:58,740
fucking propagate it doesn't mean you've

755
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,259
got rid of the virus so like it's a

756
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,058
little more complicated and the other

757
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:04,740
cell winds up traveling for your whole

758
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:07,740
Branch you have one branch yeah you have

759
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,359
to it's it's complex super clean and one

760
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,339
branch could have but the point is if we

761
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,899
if we know we got a clean plant in that

762
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:14,759
we went through like an elite clone in

763
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,980
other Industries is a two-year stress

764
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:18,058
test right so two years this plant was

765
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,399
fucking stressed and nothing happened

766
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:22,678
okay we can call it an elite if we had

767
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,959
an elite Bank where you could go and get

768
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,140
access to an elite piece and then you

769
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,000
could take it and and buy access to it

770
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,259
like you can any other plant and then

771
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,058
you you'll be able to keep it at your

772
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:35,519
house in your little in vitro setup so

773
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:38,398
you know it stays clean and you able to

774
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,679
use it as a hybridizer where they'll to

775
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,959
me there should be plants available that

776
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,659
people can access that impart specific

777
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,000
qualities meaning earlier finish higher

778
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:50,100
resistance to pests and pathogens so

779
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,380
what you can do now is take things that

780
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:54,959
you want to work with and you utilize

781
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,480
the genes that that come with this as a

782
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,759
dominant trait and then it allows people

783
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,700
to be able to work and and produce

784
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,679
products for their own needs for small

785
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,200
and Niche operations to me that's where

786
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,940
the the knowledge comes together and

787
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,100
that we can use the tools once you get

788
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,538
machine learning you'll have first

789
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:14,639
Advanced machine learning that only

790
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:16,140
larger companies can afford then you'll

791
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,419
be able to go and get an advance they're

792
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,179
learning fucking app and you'll tap in

793
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:23,640
through the cloud to someone's shit

794
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:26,220
what I know is that you used to have to

795
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,799
do sex testing through the lab now for

796
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,960
1100 bucks we can go pick up an essay

797
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,359
test and pick up the reagents and we're

798
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,700
able to test for it for sex for about

799
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:38,398
five bucks a test if you want to spend

800
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,038
1100 in a day to learn how to do it

801
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:43,079
that's not bad that's science and

802
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,058
cannabis touching so each one of these

803
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,460
things influences the small yeah it

804
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:49,678
influences a small producer and it makes

805
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,720
their lives easier and when we get into

806
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,820
the genomic end of it allows us to start

807
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,100
to take a look and figure out you know

808
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:57,538
which which plants are we playing with

809
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:59,099
that are at opposite ends of the

810
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:02,278
spectrum so if we want to see true

811
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:04,558
heterosis without having to inbreed and

812
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:07,319
stabilize two concurrent lines and then

813
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:09,599
cross to get the outlier we can actually

814
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:11,639
look through the world and say if these

815
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,678
two things collided we would get natural

816
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,380
heterosis is because they don't share

817
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,600
any common genes that kind of shit is

818
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,220
what I'm talking about but you're the

819
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:21,898
true F1 hybrid yes and well the ability

820
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,200
well they've already got them it's just

821
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:27,119
for small people like

822
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,399
in your back yes yes it's all it's it's

823
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,199
where do I think this stuff is going is

824
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:32,579
that you're you're creating a crafted

825
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,080
everyone's like no one's growing pot

826
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:35,819
anymore more people are growing fucking

827
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,678
pop and have a group got before it's

828
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:40,139
just they're not able to see the same

829
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,880
level yeah they grow in two plants four

830
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,860
plants they got a two late tent four

831
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,480
like tent they got a little backyard

832
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:47,339
they got their friends spot they got a

833
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,278
little underground like it's fucking

834
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:52,019
prevalent and and all that development

835
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:54,778
all this craft the true craft

836
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:57,179
development hobby cultivation you'll

837
00:31:54,778 --> 00:31:59,159
have so many people cultivating that if

838
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:01,559
you created platforms that allowed

839
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:03,179
people to benefit from the platform then

840
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:05,700
you would start to see people being able

841
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:07,380
to get into breeding work where you were

842
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,080
able to say look this plant we released

843
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,820
as a breeding male and and you can

844
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,079
utilize it for these purposes but it's

845
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:14,220
not good here and then there's another

846
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:16,558
one that's released so pretty soon

847
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,860
there's Gene banks that you can work

848
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:23,398
with to play around and steer so you can

849
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:26,459
take and get your desired effect and

850
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:28,319
your desired mouth and nose but with

851
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,319
something that works in your latitude

852
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,879
and your specific impact you know

853
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:34,798
to me that's that's like what I'm

854
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,720
excited about that's where the future

855
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,119
holds with it like yeah with Gene Banks

856
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,179
now accepting Canada exactly it's

857
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:44,519
actually doing like you know proper you

858
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,840
know standardized research on them and

859
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:47,579
then banking them and then holding it

860
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,558
and then having it identified as hey

861
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:52,259
this is this like it's here if you need

862
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:53,460
it yeah we take you take plans there's a

863
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:55,259
bunch of stuff coming out of the EU

864
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,120
right now which are like huge banks that

865
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:59,879
have kind of now you know they work in

866
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:01,500
you know dates and tomatoes and you know

867
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,880
other other Industries and have now

868
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,159
started just you know steering the

869
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,380
Cannabis and it's super interesting to

870
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,340
see the work they're doing because it'll

871
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,039
all

872
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:12,418
it's all AG it's just the problem

873
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:13,859
obviously and to see like how where

874
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:16,440
other AG is and the big disconnect

875
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:18,599
between cannabis and other AG it's like

876
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,899
other AG is like no we just want protein

877
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:24,359
units per square yard or per acre or

878
00:33:21,898 --> 00:33:26,398
whatever grain yields of this it's like

879
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:28,379
no no the Cannabis if you go that you

880
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,379
can go that way you can go you know we

881
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,559
just want to grow crystals on sticks

882
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,299
[Applause]

883
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:36,000
you know really quickly you're gonna

884
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:38,398
lose all the special things that make

885
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,319
this joint this joint yeah yeah because

886
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:44,219
the flavor this was he did some large

887
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:47,099
population sifts and what his the kid

888
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,500
that did this one Josh his deal is

889
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:51,178
um uh inclement weather so he's over in

890
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,398
Washington on the coast in a greenhouse

891
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:55,980
right okay so anything I send the Josh

892
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:57,839
population wise it's got to be resistant

893
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,298
yeah well what it does it lets it lets

894
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,658
me have some arthritis and then fucking

895
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:02,658
moles

896
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:07,019
if they can make it through his his

897
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:09,719
place it can make it it can make it

898
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:11,519
anywhere in the peninsula I believe so I

899
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:13,980
just know he's close enough this is one

900
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,800
of the hardest places in a place that's

901
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,000
rough and so when he's

902
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,159
out of the Thousand out of a thousand

903
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,679
plants this is the one that didn't have

904
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,500
any issues and had the best qualities in

905
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,358
addition I'm like I'm about it and

906
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,358
that's what it takes to localize like

907
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:30,358
pressures

908
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:34,940
thank you

909
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:43,648
