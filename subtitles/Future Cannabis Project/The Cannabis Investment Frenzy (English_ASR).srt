2
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:16,320
this show used to be so small that we

3
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:18,719
didn't need a large room outside of you

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,490
know obviously so what are we 10 times

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,939
where we've been in terms of the size of

6
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:26,479
this like three years ago started with

7
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,879
like 700 then it was 2000 then it was

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,329
7000 and then we went to 20 last year

9
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:35,579
which was unheard of and now it's 40,000

10
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,439
people coming to see cannabis I'm an

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,149
emerging markets guy and and and I've

12
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,500
been investing around the world my

13
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,289
career and I've also been investing in

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,710
new asset classes and and to me this

15
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:48,988
kind of stuff gets scary when I see this

16
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,579
relative to - you know I was here two

17
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:52,378
years ago it wasn't here last year two

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,640
years ago as my first I've been

19
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,549
investing in the sector for about 3

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,469
years and and this gets me a little

21
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:59,939
concerned when we also know what's going

22
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,439
on in public markets and how some

23
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:04,048
companies that launch - you know two

24
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,489
weeks ago at a 3 billion dollar market

25
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,689
cap were cut in half we won't name names

26
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:12,109
Nick the floor is yours

27
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,938
it's never as long as I don't have any

28
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:17,280
well you know I got it I got into

29
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,139
cannabis 2006 after the military and

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,210
when I saw and like from Colorado

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,859
standpoint medical markets evolving than

32
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,319
pre adult use transferring to other

33
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:26,670
states other countries it's growing but

34
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,188
when I think even this conference and

35
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,228
doubling in size of the companies that

36
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:32,519
were here last year

37
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:34,200
two-thirds of them aren't here and now

38
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,060
there's like all these new companies so

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,859
that's happening where there's all these

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,680
new states new markets new opportunities

41
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,000
ancillary hands-on hands-off and it's

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,950
hard for cannabis companies without

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,478
liquidity or without an institutional

44
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,368
cap to really get the capital they need

45
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,228
but then how do investors choose

46
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:51,000
individual portfolio opportunities do

47
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:53,219
the due diligence on them the team the

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,319
license their revenue even understand is

49
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,149
this a profitable business model because

50
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,919
normal investing is one thing cannabis

51
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,290
is another so the being able to bridge

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,909
cannabis knowledge capital knowledge

53
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,380
those are the teams are like either

54
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,299
private funds or some of the public

55
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:09,899
offerings have a lot of potential but

56
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:12,060
for most of these organizations of the

57
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,229
thirty thousand here twenty thousand

58
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,530
won't be here next year but then they'll

59
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:16,399
be enough

60
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,509
40,000 new ones ramping up at the gate

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,430
let's talk to the man who's running a

62
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:22,379
big business right now and and you know

63
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,930
how you see the world because bottom

64
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,180
line you're in a position to be

65
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,469
consolidating a lot of different markets

66
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,939
that you're in you're growing your

67
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:33,030
markets right now you're you're you know

68
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,709
you're I believe you've been referred to

69
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,959
as the Beast of the East or you would

70
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:40,739
certainly like to be so talk to me about

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,009
that Bob I think Nick Nick said it right

72
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:47,640
I read this this industry is first of

73
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:50,699
all it's been legalized state to stay so

74
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:53,250
so all the normal things of businesses

75
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:55,589
didn't exist in the cannabis world we

76
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,310
don't have banking we can't cross state

77
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,909
lines

78
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:02,189
we have unusual taxes with 280e we've

79
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:04,590
got a federal government that is lurking

80
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:06,449
in the shadows and we're trying to get

81
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,269
state governments to try to figure out

82
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:11,280
how the industry works but I think some

83
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,709
of the states have done a good job and

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,300
and in it and it's been the private

85
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,629
sector it's been the entrepreneur that

86
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,060
took the risk with private money rich

87
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:23,219
guys that took a risk and helped build

88
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,890
these incubate these companies state to

89
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:29,639
state different licenses not-for-profit

90
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:32,189
for-profit the other I think now that

91
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:35,189
the Canadian public market got involved

92
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:37,889
and all these capitals being invested up

93
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:41,909
in base trade they see a way of

94
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:46,589
aggregating multi-state operators like

95
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:53,909
ourselves I mean my company Merriman mr

96
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:57,629
MD on the oTCQB 16 consecutive growth

97
00:03:53,909 --> 00:04:01,049
quarters but I mean I think that what my

98
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:04,620
company was based on was operations I

99
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:07,019
mean we believed in strong management we

100
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,780
best practices best of class and

101
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,450
cultivation production distillation and

102
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:16,918
merchandising and we always thought that

103
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:19,409
earnings and revenue and assets would

104
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,478
make everything work we're a little

105
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,080
scared of the capital markets and the

106
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,750
multiples of projected revenue

107
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,029
and we worry about the entrepreneur

108
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,889
state the state that might be getting

109
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:32,089
killed by these category killers well

110
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:33,800
that's interesting cuz and I'll then

111
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:35,060
toss this to Nick because it sounds to

112
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,139
me like though that the capital markets

113
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,699
have been your friend let's face it

114
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:40,340
you've built an incredibly strong

115
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:42,740
company you have the position with your

116
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:45,158
your stock also potentially to be a

117
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,319
vehicle for making acquisitions or cash

118
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:49,879
you have sophisticated investors that

119
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,129
have been drawn to your company and

120
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,539
actually are investors because they kick

121
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:56,539
the tires they looked under the hood and

122
00:04:53,538 --> 00:05:00,408
they they really see a good operator so

123
00:04:56,538 --> 00:05:01,759
then the question is Nick he's building

124
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:03,829
a company that's in the public markets

125
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,098
and he continues to grow you know at an

126
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:10,008
aggressive pace and yet a lot of these

127
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:12,800
companies that we see trading on in

128
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:15,830
Toronto or OTC here shouldn't ever have

129
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,210
gone public and and you know so why are

130
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:20,120
people rewarding some of these other

131
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:22,788
companies when in fact we've all seen

132
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,788
this before at other times in asset

133
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:27,468
cycles dare I call them bubbles I would

134
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:29,028
say the current bubble is actually three

135
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:30,860
times worse than even the dot-com bubble

136
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:33,050
and it's gonna really be felt in Canada

137
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,490
I mean from what we saw in Colorado to

138
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,020
multiple states we've worked in 30

139
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,519
states our consulting company having

140
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:39,649
done licenses and most of those

141
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,598
understanding the underhood operational

142
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:43,278
companies were actually this is

143
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:45,500
agriculture this is manufacturing this

144
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:47,000
is retail brand licensing triple net

145
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,189
leasing property management companies

146
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,468
it's not master growers that's when you

147
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:53,449
have major failures seeing how that

148
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:55,038
worked on a multiple state level to then

149
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:56,060
all the licenses internationally we

150
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:57,769
started to work we saw that

151
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,569
international opportunity obviously

152
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:01,698
we've worked in Canada like five six

153
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:04,039
years done licenses have lp's genetics

154
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:06,288
companies use them even to help win our

155
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:07,759
German licenses in the beginning but now

156
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:09,019
with all of our partners internationally

157
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,180
in twelve licenses that are all

158
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:12,978
privately held with exclusive rights to

159
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,509
capital for us when you're fighting

160
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:16,128
against tilray with one license and I

161
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:18,348
have the other and there were thirteen

162
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:20,349
billion market cap and I have exclusive

163
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:22,128
capital rights operational control

164
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:23,838
that's where there's like major

165
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:26,270
opportunity but the international side

166
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:28,668
you think Colorado four years ago zero

167
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:30,560
dollars in revenue of adult use now it's

168
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:32,769
like six seven billion plus the velocity

169
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,139
of capital which is almost 7x

170
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:36,939
of a normal industry so you have almost

171
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:39,250
a fifty billion dollar economy created

172
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:41,079
in Colorado of like jobs workforce taxes

173
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,699
that people say there wasn't even a

174
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:45,339
billion in sales internationally last

175
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:47,530
year so it's too early but Canada by

176
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:49,388
being nationally legal on a medical

177
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:51,399
basis initially allowed those public

178
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:52,960
markets to happen the problem is they

179
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:54,279
also didn't realize by legalizing adult

180
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,948
use they're violating international law

181
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,239
and that's not necessarily off I'm

182
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,280
following state law but I don't like to

183
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,538
ever break international law you got to

184
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,948
know the rules to play the game and many

185
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:04,719
people don't focus on that I'm not a

186
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:06,848
lawyer or accountant we hire lots of

187
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,930
those I've worked with worked with

188
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:11,408
hundreds of them in hundreds and

189
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:14,918
hundreds I best in a lot of these

190
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:16,329
companies and and I'm also a guy that by

191
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:17,318
the way look I lived in Russia for a few

192
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:18,728
years so if there's a guy that's gonna

193
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,889
be scared travelling across borders

194
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:22,240
right it's gonna be me but we'll those

195
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,710
were the things like Homeland Security

196
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,210
all those initial fears I mean we

197
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,219
probably lost 50 million of investor

198
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:28,689
confidence based on some of those now

199
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,150
they've kind of lifted those provisions

200
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:32,889
but in the industry this is an emerging

201
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:35,709
opportunity the cannabis industry was

202
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:36,819
the gutter for so many years illicit so

203
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:38,379
then it didn't really bring the best

204
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:41,110
people and then the first people willing

205
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:42,879
to take these high-risk markets you know

206
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,979
that's like maybe not the most seasoned

207
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,658
normal triple-a type of investors so now

208
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:48,699
that we're seeing institutional capital

209
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:49,990
being interested we do have banks we do

210
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,419
have finance been internationally I'm

211
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,658
legal medical legal for the ancillary

212
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:58,149
side 1962 Single Convention on

213
00:07:55,658 --> 00:08:00,639
psychotropic substances World Health

214
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:02,918
Organization doctrines we look at these

215
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,168
and tax treaties where we can do this

216
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:06,668
what countries based on standards can

217
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:08,709
actually do it they say not just a

218
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:10,269
Cyprus not just in Malta I don't do

219
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:12,068
things just for a press release to be

220
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:14,228
worth 50 million dollars more in a

221
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:15,610
market cap the next day we make online

222
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:18,158
i'm confused it sounds to me like you're

223
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,050
telling me that that canada is not only

224
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:24,399
violating standards that are established

225
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:27,478
in the 66 treaty etc but that there's a

226
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:30,068
complete disregard for something that

227
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,508
first of all are other countries doing

228
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:33,908
this differently because it seems to me

229
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:36,219
if you listen to the canadians the

230
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:39,610
germans are welcome welcoming them with

231
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:41,360
opening arms to help them build out

232
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,329
their fledgling cannabis

233
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,399
etc so when you think about

234
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:47,838
international Germany was a major there

235
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,429
were ten initial licenses issued from

236
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,140
the bee farm and it was literally the

237
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:53,269
smallest girl I'd had to model in I'm

238
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:56,120
almost ten years like 200 kilos of

239
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:58,039
annual production but that market of 83

240
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,899
million people that also taught us about

241
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,458
the bee farm how the government's paying

242
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,589
for cannabis in health care standard

243
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,059
like socialized medicine so as long as I

244
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:06,019
meet the high quality standard at the

245
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:08,299
lowest cost to production

246
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:10,370
I'm the generic in every pharmacy so

247
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:12,500
unless adopter rates bedre can read in

248
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,839
an API for recommending pharmaceutical

249
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,909
drugs which it's considered there i'm

250
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,709
the generic i'm the lowest price highest

251
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:19,909
quality i take the whole market so

252
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,449
canada thought they're gonna take over

253
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:22,338
the world

254
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,019
i'm from northern Wisconsin but Canada

255
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:26,060
is not where you do giant greenhouses to

256
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:27,769
grow pineapples for the world so

257
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:29,899
low-class places like Colombia for oil

258
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:31,310
production one standardized where these

259
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:33,259
other markets will be so much more

260
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:36,528
advantageous I mean it sounds like

261
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:38,569
though there's an argument an easy

262
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:39,708
argument I think I agree with you that I

263
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,660
don't know why the Canadians are

264
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:43,278
necessarily I'm taking over the world

265
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:45,469
well it's wider than their capital

266
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:48,198
markets and was to take the whorl of my

267
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,820
Canadian friends but the the

268
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:51,319
international diamond dynamics you're

269
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,120
talking about I think are interesting so

270
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,230
you know Bob I'd be how do you weigh in

271
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,970
here I mean obviously you've been

272
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,470
extremely cautious about building your

273
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,570
business state-by-state

274
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:03,949
not breaking federal law that's you know

275
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,420
compliance to me is taken as a given any

276
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:07,490
any company that's been served that

277
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:09,078
survived this long started you know with

278
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,028
compliance as the first thing that they

279
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:13,370
had so I mean does this concern you

280
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:15,919
I think the Canadians opened the door or

281
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,929
the Trudeau effect national federal

282
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,338
freedom but you know I think there's

283
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:21,889
only thirty four million people in

284
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:25,100
Canada I think the cannabis business in

285
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:28,419
California will probably make that small

286
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:31,310
I think that everybody is running

287
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:33,469
watching the US and as the biggest

288
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:35,479
consumer market in the world will

289
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:39,139
ultimately take our place in the leader

290
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,870
in innovation and science and I think

291
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:44,059
the what's happening in Germany is good

292
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:46,519
Spain Portugal I mean it's happening

293
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:49,219
everywhere and and initiative is it

294
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:52,250
being driven by money are we looking for

295
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,790
jurisdictions where we can go down and

296
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,639
get cheap labor and

297
00:10:53,789 --> 00:11:00,149
is is capital the reason that cannabis

298
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,519
is making this emerging industry and I

299
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:04,559
think it strives it like everything else

300
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,720
but I think there's a bigger thing that

301
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,619
we try to do in merrimette is to care

302
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,990
about people

303
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,879
I mean care about building products and

304
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:15,930
interfacing with physician outreach

305
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:19,049
where we actually help people with with

306
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:21,599
it whether it's MS or anxiety or nausea

307
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:24,269
or PTSD and some of the things with

308
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,009
epilepsy in Rhode Island we run a clinic

309
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:28,529
with 48 families with mothers with

310
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:31,230
epileptic children to come to help see

311
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:33,569
their kids stop talk as shaking and I

312
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,570
think I saw you last week in Maryland

313
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,240
where we ran the Maryland medical

314
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,610
cannabis forum we had five of the

315
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,919
foremost doctors in the world talking

316
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,470
about using cannabis to take people off

317
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,699
of opiates and to create interface with

318
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,490
the with the physicians and the

319
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,140
pharmaceutical industry so it seems to

320
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,159
be happening all over the world we have

321
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:57,750
40,000 people here want to be to learn

322
00:11:55,159 --> 00:12:00,209
but I think money drives something

323
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:03,240
regulation drives something and I think

324
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:05,070
it's all good ultimately hopefully we'll

325
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,620
have an emerging industry that's as

326
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,540
validated medical principles that that

327
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,549
is helping people and where people

328
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:13,379
aren't hiding in fret of afraid of the

329
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:15,359
federal US law there's a big difference

330
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,919
between a medical in the United States

331
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,629
and medical internationally like our

332
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:20,009
clinical trials research is so lacking

333
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:21,389
in the United States that when we're

334
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:23,330
looking for those drug placements or

335
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:25,949
drug discovery in these other markets

336
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,020
international markets that's where if

337
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,910
five companies are doing MS research and

338
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,899
that they're projected to take 10% of

339
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:35,850
the MS market by 2020 730 billion whew

340
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,409
and Israel whew and some other locations

341
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,909
but when you're getting early mover

342
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:41,039
positions on that let's say with a hedge

343
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:43,110
getting into all five when they're going

344
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,789
towards approvals doubling down on the

345
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,800
ones moving more towards approvals

346
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:48,809
having the shares to lend to short the

347
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,209
ones that won't get approvals that anti

348
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:53,009
fragile mentality but in cannabis like

349
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,150
pharmaceutical international is one

350
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:56,069
thing but everything in the United

351
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:58,079
States medical adult use will kind of

352
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,540
merge into one thing it's just medical

353
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,030
is that quasi legality and the federal

354
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:04,409
protection but anyone can disabled that

355
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,569
that's how I got into this but anyone

356
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,490
can take somebody with epilepsy prop up

357
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,990
these things to get more

358
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,509
it's legalized we know that or how

359
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,399
medical transitions to adult use very

360
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:15,679
different from a tax basis but even

361
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,480
medical is less safe in Colorado than

362
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,949
adult use based on testing standards so

363
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,149
when we're looking at these

364
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,440
international markets

365
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:23,419
you know Canada violating international

366
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,890
law of that convention for for

367
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:26,958
legalizing something for an adult use

368
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:28,879
purpose that's on these controlled

369
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,500
substance lists that could hurt so many

370
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,149
other sectors of markets of Canadian

371
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,490
pharmaceutical companies non cannabis

372
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:36,259
related from B be able to exports other

373
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,759
markets so when we see like this

374
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:39,919
velocity effect of how those things

375
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,659
happen the wise Canadian companies are

376
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,309
taking that liquidity investing

377
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:45,199
internationally into these other markets

378
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:47,629
sometimes for press release value other

379
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,830
times for revenue share of these new

380
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,439
markets but they're doing it in a way

381
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,389
that they they no capital they know how

382
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,620
to manipulate these public markets you

383
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:56,299
know tilray a few of those have done a

384
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,440
very good job with press releases even

385
00:13:56,299 --> 00:14:00,079
though you look at the revenues to

386
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,370
earnings it's a little different but

387
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,200
they're actually buying a lot of these

388
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,700
toxic assets that when you buy the good

389
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,410
you're buying the bad where if you buy

390
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,810
this US extraction company that has fake

391
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:10,129
science and has lawsuits pending for all

392
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:12,500
these other issues you're buying all of

393
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:14,360
that with you so then like I won't push

394
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,339
those lawsuits until right before a sale

395
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,289
right before a listing right before an

396
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,060
offering and right now that's why

397
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:22,309
investors choosing individual deals or

398
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,958
individual stocks it's way too hard

399
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:26,059
you're not gonna choose the Unicorn but

400
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,949
like private funds that have exclusive

401
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:30,349
deal flow track record in cannabis and

402
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,028
capital that's where investors should be

403
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,269
looking for the longer-term impacts like

404
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:37,299
hundred ex VC funds p/e models like our

405
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:39,078
p/e models will come in and cannibalize

406
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:41,539
Canadian assets of like their

407
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:43,069
intellectual property and staff I'm

408
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:44,778
getting really confused and I feel like

409
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,709
I'm I feel like our conversation is

410
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:47,528
happening we're having four different

411
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:50,028
conversations at once which are all

412
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:51,620
incredibly important conversations so in

413
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:53,838
summary what I think we're talking about

414
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,889
first of all we're mixed brought up the

415
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,570
fact that not only is is Canada

416
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:01,299
operating internationally potentially in

417
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:05,089
an illegal fashion you believe they are

418
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:07,809
but that also this is then perpetuating

419
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:10,070
some of these Canadian companies to

420
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:11,719
around the world go out and consolidate

421
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,089
by the way good for them from a capital

422
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,709
markets perspective taking their stock

423
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:18,470
which is arguably an overpriced stock

424
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:20,448
and going out and buying companies in

425
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,430
the US or higher growth markets which

426
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:24,399
will be a creative

427
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:26,319
to their shareholders because they've

428
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,639
they've they arguably don't have a very

429
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,020
large markets we've talked about the

430
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,689
size of the Canadian market the

431
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:33,850
limitations of it and that possibly that

432
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,100
the Canadians aren't the right people to

433
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,440
be following around the globe if you're

434
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,750
an investor unless of course you think

435
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,760
that a company in Canada is buying a

436
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,589
very good asset in the US with an

437
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,080
overpriced currency the other thing

438
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:49,209
we're talking about though is the you

439
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,490
know the social good of what's going on

440
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,958
here and I think you know we're all here

441
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,278
for that I think a lot of people are

442
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,939
here for that and and as someone that

443
00:15:54,278 --> 00:16:02,559
again you know the the the allegory to

444
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:07,380
to this in I could be in in Rio or Sao

445
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:09,939
Paulo in 2002 investing in Brazilian

446
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:11,889
resource companies at a time when

447
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,410
there'd be a room this full of people

448
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:16,360
also of us investors has said oh my god

449
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:18,100
we've got own commodities oh my god the

450
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,419
bricks and all these emerging market

451
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,040
companies oh and these Brazilian

452
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:22,719
companies are really trustworthy guys

453
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,240
and we're going to give all our money to

454
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,769
them we've seen this before and it

455
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,600
doesn't always go well but I I think the

456
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:34,419
conversation that everybody can agree

457
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,370
upon is that there is not only a social

458
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:37,929
good of what's going on here but that

459
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,509
there's a massive benefit and I think

460
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:41,649
Nick you even talked about how it sounds

461
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:43,689
to me like you think if the if the

462
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:46,870
Canadians just stuck to to to medical

463
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,700
and didn't go adult we would have stayed

464
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,980
away from they would have had less

465
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,080
exposure but then you always have to

466
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,089
have a Netscape to have a Google kind of

467
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,830
emerge so I love to learn from others

468
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:58,810
failures there's plenty of successes in

469
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,220
Canada and like I said as a disabled

470
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,259
veteran that's how I got into this and

471
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,058
push this but I also know that many of

472
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:05,558
the companies that are using that social

473
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:07,928
good component are either not doing it

474
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:09,338
as profitably or correctly as they

475
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:12,189
should be because they haven't had the

476
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:15,220
same standards so international G a PGM

477
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:16,360
PGA CP GDP all of the different

478
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,549
standards that in the u.s. at

479
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,899
state-by-state but all you had to do in

480
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:21,459
the US was just follow the federal

481
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,559
guidelines and standards and then you

482
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,360
would have always been compliant but

483
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:26,859
this is the first time I feel like in

484
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,479
the history of business and capitalism

485
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:30,219
that actually doing the right thing is

486
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,690
the most profitable and like I love

487
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,058
putting in door out of business giant

488
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,250
greenhouses like 22 pounds of coal to

489
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:36,740
make

490
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,089
one gram of indoor cannabis and you love

491
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,890
the earth and it's saving like people in

492
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:40,849
cancer but you destroy like killing your

493
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,310
grandchildren to feed your children

494
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:45,259
mentality but like large things that are

495
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:47,389
making super cash flow companies that

496
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:49,339
are better than a B Corp I'm all about

497
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,410
our investors but through revolutionary

498
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:53,240
profitable businesses but the right mark

499
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,910
at the right time in the right capital

500
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,650
for it that's the challenge where

501
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,540
institutional capital is not there but

502
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:01,519
even private will still do 18.8%

503
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:03,319
interest on real estate backed by real

504
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,359
estate but even that a hundred million

505
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:07,639
of that to make eighteen million over

506
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,779
five years as a waste of money I mean I

507
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,090
would have taken that hundred and made a

508
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:13,639
billion in five so it's like knowing

509
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:15,250
when where and how and how how investors

510
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,140
need to look at this in classes

511
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,960
ancillary medical adult use you have

512
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,940
different risk profiles for each

513
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,259
dichotomy of that most of them just see

514
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,789
the cannabis industry instead of

515
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:27,680
property management company brand

516
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:31,549
licensing companies all of the different

517
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,840
verticals profitable party business

518
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:34,399
what's the part you're most excited

519
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:36,169
about I mean you're you're straddling

520
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,160
the integration between first of all

521
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:42,200
adult and medical you're you're involved

522
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,720
in infrastructure build out your company

523
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,130
also helps other companies get to the

524
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,569
places they want to go because of your

525
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,760
presence so what are you most excited

526
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:52,639
about a lot of people think that if the

527
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:55,099
u.s. if the states had just stayed to

528
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,770
medical we might have gotten the federal

529
00:18:55,099 --> 00:19:02,119
law passed a long time ago it's a good

530
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:04,730
point I'm most excited about branding

531
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:08,750
and distribution creating new lines of

532
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:10,880
products that cross state lines and puts

533
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:14,119
America back at the forefront of what it

534
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:18,020
does best I think we just made a we just

535
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:21,129
made right well it's the yeah well I

536
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:24,740
think I think the new farm bill

537
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:26,420
unleashing CBD from him is going to

538
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,779
create a whole new industry that will

539
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,779
get there will parallel track cannabis

540
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:33,970
till they integrate in five six years

541
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,410
we're excited about that opportunity

542
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:39,079
we're excited about more and more people

543
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,810
getting the benefit of feeling more

544
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:44,000
familiar I think we've made major head

545
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:46,460
roads and getting physicians to come out

546
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,140
from under the hospitals and take a more

547
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,940
vocal stance about

548
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,340
how this thing can really help people at

549
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,320
a fraction of the cost I love when we

550
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:57,349
help kids and I love when we help senior

551
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,389
citizens that are taking narcotics

552
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:01,639
because they're difficult when they

553
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,770
could have a bite of a cookie I watch a

554
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,960
movie and go to sleep and not bother

555
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:10,460
anybody so I think the industry is doing

556
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,840
instead of Netflix and chill that's what

557
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,000
we need to do I won't tell you what my

558
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,250
mother used to do it's alright yeah so

559
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,450
by the way I can't seem to get rid of

560
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,420
this guy because that we were together

561
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,950
on a panel a week ago and I do want to

562
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:25,940
bring up and I'm curious your view on

563
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:28,279
this it was a medical it was a medical

564
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,350
cannabis panel it was in conjunction

565
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,869
with the medical cannabis commission of

566
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:35,809
Maryland so we had regulators there and

567
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:38,599
we had three of the four most doctors

568
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:42,589
Juanes last PhD who are spending and

569
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:45,740
devoting their life to science and what

570
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:49,039
was so impressive about this event was

571
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,230
the not only you know the the social

572
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,119
kind of reverberation your your feeling

573
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,009
from the doctors who see the impact

574
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,109
they're having in the community but also

575
00:20:55,009 --> 00:21:00,170
the other powerful thing was the

576
00:20:57,109 --> 00:21:01,609
frustration that exists right now when

577
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:04,550
there's so much good that can be done

578
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:07,599
with medical cannabis and yet it's we're

579
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:09,339
still so far away from properly

580
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,389
educating the medical community

581
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:13,699
educating the dispensaries I mean let's

582
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:17,180
face it you know

583
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:19,069
I hope no one here I hope you guys don't

584
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:22,100
know I mean you know Bob you owned

585
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:24,169
dispensaries yes so how are you guys

586
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:25,879
well what's next next turn to talk but I

587
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,590
want you to help us understand how the

588
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,800
dispensaries are gonna try to better

589
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:33,319
educate and or to do what we hear from

590
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,599
the doctors is is overcoming an issue

591
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:37,970
where patients are going into facilities

592
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:41,589
and not coming away with either the the

593
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:43,519
prescribed product and and and and

594
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:45,470
medical cannabis that they came in there

595
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,730
for well that's the problem you use the

596
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,049
word prescribe so that means you're

597
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,490
talking about international markets

598
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:50,990
because in the United States it's doctor

599
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,569
recommendations because they're not able

600
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:56,180
to actually prescribe medical cannabis

601
00:21:53,569 --> 00:21:58,129
medical is a term that we use in the

602
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,720
United States for one classification I

603
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,430
see it from the tax rate and the access

604
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,970
like what are the qualifying conditions

605
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,070
of that mark

606
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,059
it normally back in the day if it didn't

607
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:07,279
have pain or PTSD

608
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:09,679
we wouldn't investor go into it it's a

609
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,319
short squeeze market doctor education is

610
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,850
important but like in Germany doctors

611
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,439
when they go to make a prescription for

612
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:17,659
cannabis they're going onto a database

613
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,880
of an API network that has all of the

614
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,529
prescription drugs and it's there in the

615
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,970
United States we have those but cannabis

616
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:25,399
is not listed even though it's been a

617
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,740
part of our pharmacopoeia for 150 plus

618
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,450
years so medical cannabis in the United

619
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,650
States is very different than medical

620
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,529
cannabis internationally or

621
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:36,410
pharmaceutical FDA clinical trial like

622
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:38,990
efficacy BMI so we can never get those

623
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:40,640
confused doctor education is lacking but

624
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,380
I think a lot of them just realize if

625
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,170
the market allows it where it's this

626
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,940
could help potentially help my client

627
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,640
with X you know ailments

628
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,990
those like a California law Guam some of

629
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,120
those others the really restrictive

630
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:55,099
states and markets without doctor

631
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,419
education we have no patients patients

632
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:59,119
or clients clients revenue revenue

633
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,650
business it's not about bud tenders but

634
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,359
some states like Pennsylvania you had to

635
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,800
have medical doctors pharmacists like

636
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:05,899
having dealt with like controlled

637
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,849
substances in the past so each state's

638
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,670
different but most dispensaries you're

639
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:13,339
not tell the false claims this cures

640
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:15,289
this has been shown to like following

641
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:17,419
normal FDA guidance and having budtender

642
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:19,670
retail sales associate patient advocate

643
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,769
education so I like the good groups like

644
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:23,630
the great nonprofits like Americans for

645
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:24,889
safe access patient focused

646
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,690
certification like when they're actually

647
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:29,170
educating how to talk about medical

648
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,640
cannabis not falsely make medical claims

649
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:34,190
even though we know like how efficacious

650
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,600
is is you mean you think CBD side here

651
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,220
I mean ninety-five percent of those

652
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,439
products in the u.s. don't even have CBD

653
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,779
and it's like heroin based on legality

654
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,980
right now so you you know we've dealt

655
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:45,079
with hemp we've dealt with cannabis and

656
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,640
all the cannabinoids but it's just that

657
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:48,109
misinformation which has really hurt our

658
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,940
markets it's hurting investor confidence

659
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:51,649
it's why the right investors like

660
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,940
trusting those right sources just

661
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,650
because of public companies public

662
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,090
doesn't mean they're actually disclosing

663
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,860
everything about the market because many

664
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:59,179
of them don't even know where you're

665
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:00,829
seeing how they're operating and it's

666
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,440
just press release press release market

667
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:05,449
cap market cap versus revenue versus

668
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,670
long-term ownership and control those

669
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,980
quick returns to be made here but the

670
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:11,390
real investments into the long-term

671
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,400
multi trillion-dollar industry right

672
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,780
here coming we only have a few more

673
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,769
years to get all those really positions

674
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:17,058
otherwise

675
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:19,670
you're just gonna like be trading Apple

676
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:20,839
that's like hey apples got some room to

677
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,700
grow or like you want to shirt the Hong

678
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,980
Kong dollar with me everyone does that

679
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,200
this is now urgent and now the big

680
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,920
players are seeing it to get up those

681
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,539
mas

682
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,519
like one federal legalization happens

683
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:33,710
here big emanates internationally and

684
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:37,308
then like reverse IPOs and those true

685
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,779
bonafide IPOs go public when ready 95

686
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:40,428
plus percent of those companies have not

687
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:42,230
and it'll hurt investors some will make

688
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:43,820
a little bit now but not like the

689
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,920
Cargill's that we're creating privately

690
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:47,480
well it just seems to me look there was

691
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,460
obviously a run to market and there was

692
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,589
a again we've talked at some length of

693
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,808
why the capital markets we know why

694
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:56,689
they're necessary but but we we also

695
00:24:53,808 --> 00:25:00,740
know why Canada fed a bit of an asset

696
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:02,240
bubble but it seems to me that this is a

697
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,440
market that's incredibly more

698
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:09,500
discriminating than it was a year ago

699
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,820
not only because people have gotten

700
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,920
smarter and realized there's a lot of

701
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:14,629
companies that that you know even you

702
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,100
know it's nice again I use my emerging

703
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,809
markets metaphor it's nice to talk about

704
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,129
the potential and the consumption growth

705
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:21,829
patterns that are going to change and

706
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,690
the demographics but the reality is at

707
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:25,519
some point a company needs to be worth

708
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,880
something that's relative to something

709
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,400
else

710
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,890
and it needs to be fair so we know why

711
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,140
people just gotten smarter also there's

712
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,000
just more things to invest in so before

713
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,550
you just had this this you know

714
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,049
effectively a proxy play where someone

715
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:40,669
would own you know one or two of the big

716
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:42,230
Canadian LPS we know who they are it

717
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,250
doesn't make them bad guys it just

718
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,950
doesn't mean that they were terribly

719
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:49,490
cheap or a good investment beyond the

720
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:51,890
first you know 50% move higher the other

721
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,539
dynamic that I think is as a capital

722
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:56,090
markets guy that's maybe the most

723
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:58,039
important one right now on a in terms of

724
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:58,879
the investor part of the conversation

725
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:00,470
we're having one of the six

726
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:06,410
conversations we're having in one

727
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:10,640
tonight is that you you you ultimately

728
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:12,860
have a I think a dynamic where a lot of

729
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,990
these companies will need more capital

730
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:17,119
in the future are going to have to go to

731
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,769
markets and actually prove proof of

732
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,659
concept and and you know Bob's been

733
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:22,279
doing this from day one and obviously

734
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,040
the capital markets have continued to

735
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:26,960
reward him that may be about to happen

736
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,730
in a market place where capitals not

737
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,450
free so I am talking about mister market

738
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,130
now and what

739
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,429
we've gone through in the last two

740
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:37,700
months of volatility for global markets

741
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:39,679
the the the real genesis of the cannabis

742
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,750
capital markets happened in a world

743
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:46,120
where capital was free and and

744
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:49,429
volatility was zero and and that's also

745
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:52,489
an under talked about dynamic for

746
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:55,250
investing today because I won't get into

747
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:57,079
a wonky conversation on global central

748
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,700
banks and investment dynamics and that

749
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:03,259
kind of one-on-one stuff this is a

750
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:05,419
cannabis show but it's critical to the

751
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:07,099
path for investments and the growth of

752
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:08,389
capital markets I mean Bob you get do

753
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:10,459
you get worried about the change in

754
00:27:08,388 --> 00:27:13,129
capital markets environment from a

755
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:16,610
market perspective that we could have in

756
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:18,679
the first quarter of 2019 in other words

757
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:20,569
it could get really nasty out there the

758
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:23,809
Fed could overstep their bounds as they

759
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:26,240
do every time volatility if you follow

760
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:28,638
the VIX is at 25 right now in averaged

761
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,000
11 for the preceding 12 months or eleven

762
00:27:28,638 --> 00:27:33,408
and a half so does that even enter your

763
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,298
your sphere of reference as you think

764
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:37,159
about your capital market strategy you

765
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:39,829
always cognizant of all those

766
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:41,539
sophisticated things and what happens in

767
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:44,359
other industry or historically in the

768
00:27:41,538 --> 00:27:47,750
market I think cannabis has broken a lot

769
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:50,058
of the rules and I think two things are

770
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,788
happening one everybody in the states no

771
00:27:50,058 --> 00:27:56,928
prohibition is coming and it's going to

772
00:27:52,788 --> 00:27:59,028
end and when it comes the big companies

773
00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:01,159
the pharmaceutical the alcohol are going

774
00:27:59,028 --> 00:28:03,349
to come in and whoever had the courage

775
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,240
to make the investments whether on the

776
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:09,259
private side or even on the public side

777
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:12,859
are going to make out reward at big time

778
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:15,259
but I think the it still starts day to

779
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:17,928
day of earnings and revenue and helping

780
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:21,619
people and and I think it will sort its

781
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:23,720
way out the multiples in Canada there'll

782
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:25,428
be winners and losers I mean whoever

783
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,679
doesn't make their numbers next year

784
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:29,600
based on what they value today are gonna

785
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,919
have to answer to their stockholders in

786
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:34,308
the marketplace

787
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,679
merrimette we have consistent growth we

788
00:28:34,308 --> 00:28:38,558
try not to get our head of ourselves

789
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,059
some people think we're value too high

790
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:43,190
compared to other realities and other

791
00:28:41,058 --> 00:28:45,079
people this other company

792
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,360
that look just like us that are five

793
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:48,740
times more valuable than us so are they

794
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,859
to hire me to love

795
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:54,200
I think only time will tell and I think

796
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:57,679
the next 2019 is going to be a major

797
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,960
year for the cannabis industry kind of

798
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,490
like you said about volatile volatility

799
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,380
where there's some volatility now

800
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,920
there's opportunity but the other thing

801
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:09,230
about cannabis is we are recession proof

802
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,660
we literally grow money on trees and I

803
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,670
was like alcohol tabacco recessions I

804
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,080
mean we're in a Claddagh gory there

805
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,539
where it's not just the adult use like

806
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:18,789
side but from a medical standpoint ahem

807
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:21,649
standpoint everything that we're doing

808
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:23,089
the verticals are so much larger than

809
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:24,500
other markets that if you're in those

810
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:26,449
public markets you're exposed to that

811
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,640
volatility even of other unrelated

812
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,279
markets private companies that are cash

813
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,750
flowing themselves based on this much

814
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,129
more insulated from some of those

815
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,210
changes now I can't just do a press

816
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,640
release and have a hundred million

817
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,049
dollars the next day like that takes you

818
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,330
know maybe a quarter to raise at a time

819
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:43,369
like when private capital now but

820
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:44,750
whether there's these major volatile

821
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:47,839
markets and people are going in and

822
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:50,359
buying these toxic assets or creating

823
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,859
like new positive asset classes it's

824
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:53,419
that moment that where you know where to

825
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:55,219
put the capital when to hold when to

826
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,259
sell or now even with our hedge fund

827
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,970
strategy how to actually do market

828
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:00,650
regulation and profit from it from the

829
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,210
market volatility from the wrong players

830
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,860
who got into the wrong boat for how they

831
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:05,690
were going to raise their capital but

832
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:08,119
going public for like initial liquidity

833
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:09,830
for investors great I love that play but

834
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:11,539
right now all of the companies listing

835
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:13,970
reverse mergers splits off from the US

836
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:15,529
they're see easy access to capital but

837
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,450
they're exposed and they're all part of

838
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:19,220
that same part so when that sector goes

839
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:22,340
down you saw a couple weeks ago like

840
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,960
that 20% that was not a fun few days for

841
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:24,769
a lot of those public companies we

842
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,410
didn't feel any of that

843
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:28,849
and actually I had days there that new

844
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:31,850
Purchase Agreements happening based on

845
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:33,319
lower prices so vertical integration

846
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:35,539
owning the means of production like

847
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:37,220
seeing that hands on side the biotech

848
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:39,049
the drug discovery what these things

849
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,700
will be worth these are times that you

850
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:42,680
could never get these positions again so

851
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,840
even though it's volatile opportunities

852
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,100
are vast if you know where to put those

853
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:48,409
or if you've worked in this for a decade

854
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:50,990
go and make those individual investments

855
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:53,000
either stocks or private but if not I'm

856
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:55,309
not just pushing etf's here or certain

857
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,720
REITs or ancillary or hands-on but some

858
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:58,250
of the private funds now are great but

859
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,380
and even some of them look at a courage

860
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,569
then like by going public and then some

861
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,070
of these lawsuits that are happening

862
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:05,298
things were done early and just because

863
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:06,980
you have a great advisor and great

864
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:08,990
pedigree does not mean you know Capital

865
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:12,740
in cannabis you know one point that I've

866
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:16,038
failed to make is the the black market

867
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:18,710
of cannabis is is around us the 80 to

868
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:21,798
100 billion dollars that already exists

869
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:24,259
in the cannabis market but I'm in for

870
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:26,538
the shadows all the legal market is

871
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:29,720
doing is it's bringing that out of the

872
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:32,058
shadows and into reality and into taxes

873
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,558
and into health so I think it's a good

874
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:37,009
summary I think the industry is and a

875
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:38,990
good foothold and I think as all markets

876
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:41,298
do they all shake out to some sort of

877
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:44,029
reality yeah I think that's right and

878
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:45,980
and the the point that I would be hoping

879
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:48,470
to make is not to dispute that this is

880
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:51,349
gonna be a counter-cyclical high-growth

881
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:54,230
industry for a long time the nature of

882
00:31:51,349 --> 00:31:57,288
the product the nature of the usage is

883
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:00,798
not necessarily attached to a boom bust

884
00:31:57,288 --> 00:32:02,869
economy but and I would it's it's

885
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,179
impossible dispute to me as someone that

886
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:06,619
invests in public and private companies

887
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:08,059
that private companies are less volatile

888
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:09,639
on a day to day basis of course they are

889
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:12,529
there's nope there's no mark to market

890
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,390
by the way a lot of companies suddenly

891
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:15,829
become worthless overnight in a market

892
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,390
where capital markets fall apart and

893
00:32:15,829 --> 00:32:19,939
businesses they're too starved for

894
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:22,400
capital so I would just simply say that

895
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,320
we all believe in what we're doing here

896
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,490
we all believe that this is a market

897
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,609
that's going to continue to attract

898
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:30,200
bright minds and deep pocketed investors

899
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:32,000
whether they be institutions whether

900
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,819
they be strategic partners whether they

901
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,859
be family offices the rich guys that

902
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:38,210
that that Bob's talking about that that

903
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:40,158
actually were brave guys coming out here

904
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,569
laying you know reaching into their wall

905
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,809
and investing in something that most

906
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:48,490
people said they were crazy on but we

907
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:51,079
I've seen it time and time again that

908
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:52,819
and if you've I kind of feel like I know

909
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:54,230
with when my dad used to talk to me

910
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:56,689
about my grandfather who lived through

911
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:59,120
the depression and and how he was

912
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:03,019
changed by that I mean look I I managed

913
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:05,959
money through the crisis I lost half my

914
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:07,668
financial wealth from the crisis anyone

915
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,890
who went through that says markets can

916
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:10,490
do almost anything and by the way for a

917
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,550
fledgling

918
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,839
industry that is capital starved okay as

919
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:17,960
much as there's money floating around

920
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:20,149
here everybody here needs money okay and

921
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,240
so if you cut off the spicket to that in

922
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:24,980
a shocked fashion all I'm saying is

923
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,140
first of all good healthy companies will

924
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,089
go out of business because they weren't

925
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,679
planned for that and investors will be

926
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:32,058
on the wrong side of investments with

927
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,240
great companies and great management

928
00:33:32,058 --> 00:33:36,440
teams and wonder what happened so I

929
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,200
don't want to scare anybody I think

930
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,420
we're all cognizant of that but but it's

931
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,130
it's important to understand you know I

932
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,230
spoke out of the conference on the west

933
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,840
coast a few months ago when everything

934
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:50,900
was at its peak everything and I gave my

935
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:52,730
Japan in the 1980 speech and by the way

936
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,470
I'm not neural roubini man III think

937
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,420
he's doom and gloom and this and that so

938
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,329
I want to make this really clear sorry

939
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:03,230
Ariel but I mean really you know but I

940
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:04,789
do think that Japan is still getting

941
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:06,950
through the excesses of cash-rich

942
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:08,360
without a plan is not a way to invest

943
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:11,418
where they're building golf courses to

944
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,070
nowhere and I you know that is one of

945
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:16,250
the first things I I was thinking about

946
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:19,250
when I was given a you know a you know

947
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:22,489
whatever a keynote pitch so sorry for

948
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:25,789
being Timmy downer here but you know Bob

949
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:28,699
just sum up for me I don't know what

950
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:31,128
your expectations were for MJ biz 2018

951
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:33,529
but I mean it's been insane so you know

952
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:37,849
talk about that 2018 has been great more

953
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:41,179
people were deals more more education

954
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:44,989
were new systems more technology more

955
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:47,179
doctors and I think the the atmosphere

956
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:48,979
and the health of our industry is strong

957
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:50,450
so thankful for events like this not

958
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,219
just for like the business generation

959
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:53,868
but like you're seeing this movement and

960
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:55,128
really taking traction every one of

961
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:56,720
these people that comes to it is really

962
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:58,579
an advocate for us and then like through

963
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,739
education driving business it's great

964
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:02,420
but we need more foot soldiers out there

965
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:04,699
that are educated and that's what we've

966
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,960
lacked in the United States forever from

967
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:07,489
a business standpoint I mean the new

968
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,559
clients are great the new referral

969
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:11,419
partners the new vendors the new access

970
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:12,920
to different technologies is always

971
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,269
spectacular right I like walking around

972
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,000
thinking which companies I want to buy

973
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:18,349
which ones I want to short but from our

974
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,300
standpoint I think we had seven new

975
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:22,549
countries you know with engagements here

976
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,260
from a consulting standpoint you know

977
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,820
probably 50 plus million a prime

978
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:28,130
capital commitments based on meetings

979
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,570
that have happened here amazing what

980
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,130
these things do for the industry and

981
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,260
long term we're creating something that

982
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,640
pass on to future generation so we we

983
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,200
have to remember that like you said with

984
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,150
the responsibility of our companies to

985
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:40,489
our shareholders but also knowing

986
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,930
there's a lot of opportunity here a lot

987
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:44,469
of ways to make money a lot of ways to

988
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:46,519
lose money if you don't know how

989
00:35:44,469 --> 00:35:48,469
diversifying that risk putting things

990
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,840
together like which cede to sales work

991
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:53,149
which ones don't choose one company it's

992
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,220
probably not going to be a unicorn but

993
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,900
like diversifying across the sector's a

994
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,879
lot more insulation when it's backed

995
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,220
with real estate assets intellectual

996
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,570
property a little bit more insulated

997
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:04,699
than the public market volatility you

998
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,930
got to be in both but public when ready

999
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:07,939
and established I think long term

1000
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:09,739
they'll write about how this happened

1001
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,510
compared to dot-com bubble and then

1002
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:12,679
Luxembourg Exchange Tel Aviv exchange

1003
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,930
but then you look at revenue on those

1004
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:17,389
companies too or have a limitation on a

1005
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:18,919
market not allowing export will change a

1006
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:21,799
multi trillion-dollar industry

1007
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,840
trajectory within a few years so without

1008
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,180
without these events we would literally

1009
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,680
be still in the basement so really

1010
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:30,019
honored for MGB is what they do end up

1011
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,909
for your companies and major news like

1012
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:34,070
covering this we really appreciate it I

1013
00:36:31,909 --> 00:36:35,179
mean I think we're obviously not in the

1014
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,680
basement here but the good news for

1015
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:38,119
everybody here is we're barely on the

1016
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:41,329
first floor I mean we're we're barely

1017
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:50,469
we're building a foundation right here

1018
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:50,469
