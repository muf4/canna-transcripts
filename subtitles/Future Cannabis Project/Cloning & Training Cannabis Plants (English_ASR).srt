1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,279
behind the scenes

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:09,599
low budget productions all right so

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,240
tom we're in the valley right now and

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,280
you've been

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,359
on set to a lot of valley porn shoots

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,439
so i want to compare and contrast the

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,320
production level of the porn shoots to

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,800
our

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,359
home cannabis cultivation shoots we're

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,359
killing it

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,118
you haven't seen this raised bed since

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,278
since round one yeah

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,799
they're beautiful planting absolutely

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,159
beautiful look at the green

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:39,119
look at the turgidity uh i love it

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,759
you know i love the health you know it's

17
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,280
growing

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:45,759
just like a standard seed stock

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,520
you know you can already smell yeah no i

20
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,320
love last week i smelled it for the

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,320
first time

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,679
how does this uh the uh the soil look to

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,679
you soil looks beautiful

24
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,119
i mean the canopy now is kind of making

25
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,439
some shade for it so

26
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,119
you're probably watering less you know

27
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,679
the moisture is perfect look at the

28
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,558
roots

29
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,920
wow roots are actually coming coming to

30
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,280
the top you can actually i don't know if

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,000
you can get in close there but yeah

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,359
there's a lot of root growth

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,280
you know and this for this particular

34
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,879
one we didn't add the mycorrhizae at the

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,040
root zone which usually is

36
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,959
what you'd want to do we didn't have any

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,640
so for that time where'd it go

38
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,158
it's in the box right yeah you got and

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,840
you guys added some prior

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,439
like last week or a couple weeks ago

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,840
about uh one week ago

42
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,758
yeah so we do have micro we do have

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,118
mycorrhizae fungal in there fungi in

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,879
there so

45
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,078
that's a good thing okay so first of all

46
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,879
time you said

47
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,599
we planted these exactly a month ago i

48
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,719
do believe

49
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,719
if we look at the tape it was about june

50
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,078
22nd something like that and this is

51
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,879
july 20th

52
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,000
21st 23rd yeah so exactly basically

53
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,478
exactly a month

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,359
um and when i brought him over there

55
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,118
about a week

56
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,799
after pop in so they look beautiful so

57
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,879
that means that this is what like five

58
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,360
and a half weeks

59
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:05,679
from seed now

60
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,599
we can start to determine a couple

61
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,360
factors here

62
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,639
you know it's a little early so i'm not

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,640
going to jump the gun on it

64
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,199
wait a little bit but you want to be

65
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:23,359
cognizant of

66
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:26,719
these these two here

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,599
okay oh yeah because we're still looking

68
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,199
yeah okay so

69
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,839
let's let's let's look at this for a

70
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,839
second yeah

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,639
okay so

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,919
even though they're vegging right even

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,599
though they're vegging and it's just

74
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,839
something to look at

75
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:41,840
um

76
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,519
tom sadly probably two of these are

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,759
gonna have to go yeah i think two or

78
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,280
maybe possibly even three

79
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:58,959
oh i know would you be sad

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,519
or very sad if all four could be one

81
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,319
giant plant for a boy that's for sure

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,840
but look at this

83
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,598
and this isn't veg so this is still

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,598
jumping the gun it's just something

85
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,039
throughout experience you start to you

86
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,399
start to look at it you want to try to

87
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,000
get the early signals

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,640
of what could be male what could be what

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,239
could be female and you'll see on this

90
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,719
one you just have

91
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,759
you know and these could very very well

92
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,800
grow

93
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,239
uh some some hair pistols uh to indicate

94
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,719
that they will be

95
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,759
uh female but you can kind of already

96
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,120
get

97
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,798
an indication from there on the sides

98
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,519
there you go real close and it's still

99
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,519
vegging so

100
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,959
we don't want to jump the gun but it's

101
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,039
just you look at it and you go okay

102
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,000
these are the ones that i may want to

103
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,079
look at

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,199
as we go into transition and because

105
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,040
you'll see ones that are

106
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,238
definitely more dominant on the male

107
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,318
side given this

108
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,599
given the given the structure as well

109
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,958
you see how

110
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,839
uh the nodes are kind of staggered a

111
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,560
little bit

112
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,519
and then we have nodes here that are

113
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,080
completely

114
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,640
symmetrical so these are these are just

115
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
some

116
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,279
things it's not a certain but it is just

117
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,878
something through experience that you

118
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,199
look at i say oh wow the ones that are

119
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,438
symmetrical usually not all the time

120
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,878
turned out to be male and the ones that

121
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:13,598
were a little bit more staggered and

122
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,199
such

123
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,639
actually we're we're uh we're female

124
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,120
a couple other things too just looking

125
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,639
at it you can see

126
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,399
some of this internode

127
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:32,879
uh where where you would see

128
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:35,359
uh male organisms popping out

129
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,800
on these corners here so we just we just

130
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,479
want to take we just want to

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,960
keep our eye on these three seeing them

132
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,800
popping it just looks like they might

133
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,000
they might you know and then given the

134
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,879
the length

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,120
uh the length but you know these could

136
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,279
these could be really nice males tom

137
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,160
yeah and that right there like let's say

138
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,799
you wanted to take

139
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,680
that smell and apply it to another

140
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,280
female that

141
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,280
you also liked the smell but needed

142
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,119
something extra these are the these are

143
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,799
the genetic traits that you look for so

144
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,560
when you look at a male you're not all

145
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,960
you know it's not it's not horrible it's

146
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,639
like

147
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,319
man maybe i want to put this aside or

148
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,120
maybe i'll i'll

149
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,599
scoop it out put it in a pot move it

150
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,000
move it you know to another area

151
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
you know and and maybe cut off a few the

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,399
branches and

153
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,799
wrap one collect some some dust

154
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,000
some pollen and so you can keep it and

155
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,079
carry it and hold it and maybe

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,279
apply it to other other but that's a

157
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,159
whole you know probably you'll probably

158
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,559
cover that whole segment somewhere

159
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,520
yeah and yeah there's a lot of guys that

160
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,079
can really help

161
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,680
you know figure all the experts in in

162
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,719
that thing but just looking at overall

163
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,079
growing

164
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,840
just you want to look at a couple of

165
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,120
those traits in the plant

166
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,198
so that you know it's like man i don't

167
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,399
want to mess up the the entire crop or

168
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,840
my neighbor's crop

169
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,719
so let me make sure

170
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,918
down the street you know so it's just

171
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,080
something we want to look at down the

172
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:59,279
line but overall the health is great

173
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:01,599
um you know some people would maybe wait

174
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,519
uh have grown a couple weeks and then

175
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,080
have maybe topped

176
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,918
so then you can get a bushier plant

177
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,279
lower especially when you're

178
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,120
you know have neighbors and stuff you

179
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,719
don't really know what what their uh

180
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,240
what their thoughts are on it so do we

181
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,280
want to top them today

182
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
you know um

183
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,519
i usually don't top them when they're

184
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,800
this big you you can though because you

185
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,439
know you have like let's say you were to

186
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,240
just go

187
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,719
just go you know kind of you wanted to

188
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,120
keep it

189
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,440
if you want so you could just top that

190
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,680
right there that whole thing can go

191
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,360
you know and so now you have one two

192
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,079
three and so you have some

193
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,120
some staggered here which is good uh and

194
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,399
then that'll start to

195
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,240
grow these ones and then what's gonna

196
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,079
happen too it's gonna be easier for you

197
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,639
because this top is off and not in the

198
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,159
way

199
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,400
it's gonna be easier if you maybe even

200
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,639
put a trellis over this tom and then

201
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,598
move these down a little bit right you

202
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,879
know and then

203
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,120
what's gonna happen is because this

204
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,038
beautiful sun this will grow up

205
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,639
this will grow up this will grow up and

206
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:02,478
now you have two

207
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,800
four six eight extra arms on one arm

208
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:04,639
right

209
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,879
so now that you've increased your yield

210
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,918
you've increased your your own uh

211
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,598
uh your medicine i think that's a uh

212
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,038
moth yeah probably a little moth or

213
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,839
something i'd say

214
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,199
it's a little aggressive for a leaf

215
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,799
miner but uh yeah

216
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,439
yeah but those are ways you can increase

217
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,840
yield

218
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,918
you know more medicine and even just

219
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,638
like the plant itself really likes to

220
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,159
likes to be uh trellised and then again

221
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,560
you can keep them bushy

222
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,919
away from view from uh time i think you

223
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,759
should go loud and proud

224
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,079
yeah let the neighborhood know you know

225
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,000
but i i personally i love seeds i love

226
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,680
how they grow and sometimes i just

227
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,279
i let them do their thing you know i'll

228
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,639
let them do their thing so

229
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,638
yeah like wild stuff how long will it

230
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,720
take before we know for sure what the

231
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,560
what the sex is you'll know like uh

232
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,800
probably at the first week of transition

233
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,160
okay we'll probably have it already okay

234
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,680
so that's a few weeks ago probably like

235
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,879
a couple probably a couple weeks away

236
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,160
yeah you know this year has been i don't

237
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,360
know if you guys seen it but things have

238
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,680
been flowering a little earlier this

239
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,199
year

240
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,879
that that's what people yeah it's

241
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,639
interesting yeah

242
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,400
yeah so just global warming yeah just

243
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,560
keep your eye on it

244
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,598
and uh and you know but so far i think

245
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,519
the health is great

246
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,360
you know you can even uh cut a couple

247
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,799
clones off the bottom here

248
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,080
you can do a little trimming just kind

249
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,478
of eliminate some of the stuff that

250
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,519
isn't

251
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,959
that's being more shaded so well why

252
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,878
don't we cut i mean we could certainly

253
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,878
cut one or two yeah

254
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,400
um i don't know you know what i've done

255
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,039
in the past and it's worked for me

256
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,519
is all we i if we put them in a plastic

257
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,918
bag i have

258
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,440
root right right whatever at home you

259
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,559
know and i've actually even put them

260
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,039
uh in a cup with a little fpf and you

261
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,399
just

262
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,158
if you can get yeah get back to the

263
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,039
house i also have a turbo cloner we

264
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,240
could do so

265
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,838
yeah aeroponics cloning we could do some

266
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
into the we could clone a bunch of

267
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,440
different ways yeah yeah there's

268
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,079
so many ways to do some you know it's

269
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,399
there's so so why don't we cut a couple

270
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,240
and uh and tom do you do you have like

271
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,080
uh like a sandwich baggie

272
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,680
sure let's do a little cleanup and then

273
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,200
uh we'll cut a couple clowns so we

274
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,639
forget about this

275
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
tom tom we're just gonna leave that for

276
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,879
you ring bring three

277
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,000
three bags yeah ah we're going to start

278
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,600
we're going to get

279
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,720
yeah we're going to start documenting

280
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,720
we're going to label the plants

281
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,559
yeah it's great though the health is

282
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,920
awesome beautiful sun out here i love

283
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,119
these leaves

284
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,879
well since we're going to trim a little

285
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
bit we could cut a couple clones take

286
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,600
off

287
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,759
a few leaves that gives us room to maybe

288
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,959
plant some i brought some uh

289
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,159
some of the cover crops or companion

290
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,599
plants too

291
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,278
yeah would those go in there or would we

292
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,440
put them in um

293
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,559
both we could put them in both yeah okay

294
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,680
great

295
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:48,319
so what are each of these is that the uh

296
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,879
which ones are the auto

297
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,879
these three

298
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,320
is this the auto or the full term

299
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,000
full term oh no this

300
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,600
this was in your pot do you remember

301
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,679
this was in your small pocket

302
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,959
that's right tom you gotta remember this

303
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:09,120
stuff more

304
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:11,439
okay let's start from the top again

305
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,039
this brings back memories which ones are

306
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,079
the this is not too much to keep track

307
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,719
yeah and what's that one

308
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:16,719
whoa where's that

309
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,240
is that an auto pulling them out from

310
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,240
everywhere

311
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:34,240
that's awesome good lord this little run

312
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,160
[Music]

313
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,600
right so if we can figure out the four

314
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,439
auto oh it's these four

315
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,720
i do believe okay but why is there a

316
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,800
what's this

317
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,800
okay put that next to the clinic

318
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,519
i think th this is the uh tomato so here

319
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,159
are two

320
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,799
tomatoes so first what i'm gonna do is

321
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,799
i'm just gonna get

322
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,759
set up with a little bit of condensation

323
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,519
or a little bit of water

324
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:06,399
to create a uh a home for our clones

325
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,600
now usually we want to have our domes

326
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,360
our trays but

327
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,800
hey in the world of the cove and

328
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,320
sometimes the stores are closed so you

329
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,278
work with what you got and so this is

330
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,519
what we got

331
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,879
and it works really well actually uh

332
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,320
just goes to show you how resilient

333
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,759
these plants really are

334
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,680
but what we're gonna do is we'll just

335
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,519
take the fpf

336
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,039
uh because we're gonna we're gonna we're

337
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,560
gonna cut some clones

338
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,240
and so we're just gonna use a little bit

339
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,879
of the fpf as a

340
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,000
as a as a little bit of a root hormone

341
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:36,720
given its

342
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,720
uh high fulvic content

343
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,240
folic acid is really good for

344
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,159
propagation so on look at look at how

345
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,039
much i'm taking there it really is just

346
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,199
a drop

347
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,159
this is a one milliliter a gallon

348
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,959
product so

349
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,319
when we're filling up just our little uh

350
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,159
spray bottle

351
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,240
you really don't need much and so i'm

352
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:57,838
just going to kind of hold that there

353
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,839
and rinse off

354
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:15,600
everything okay over there

355
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,600
perfect so don't need much

356
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,079
i'm just going to give that a little

357
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,120
shake

358
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,278
perfect we use this we'll actually

359
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,440
once we're done cutting we're going to

360
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,278
use fpf to do a foliar as well so

361
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,040
that'll kind of

362
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:41,439
kind of help the areas where we've cut

363
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,719
and keep and keep the plant really

364
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,399
healthy

365
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,000
right after we've created a little bit

366
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,159
of stress for it you know at first it

367
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,759
might create a little stress but after

368
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,600
after a moment they really thank you for

369
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,799
cleaning them up you can you can

370
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,278
actually watch

371
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,479
watch them pray once they're done but

372
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,039
what we have here is we have

373
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,920
four different uh four different are

374
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,360
these all three this

375
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,199
are these four the same they're all the

376
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,879
same okay so uh we have

377
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,278
four set here but we want to do is we

378
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:10,000
want to make sure that we take cuts

379
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,519
because taking cuts off of seeds is the

380
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,440
funnest part because

381
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,839
if you really really love one of the

382
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,480
seeds the smells the tastes

383
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,399
and and the medicine it provides then

384
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,240
you want to make sure you've held on to

385
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,000
to something that you can grow and

386
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,480
continuously grow that so

387
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,759
this this to me looks like a really nice

388
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,320
nice cut it's it's

389
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,439
not super thick like this so it's not

390
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,079
going to overburden

391
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,600
its needs when it's in a uh when it's in

392
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,399
a cloner but this one looks

393
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,000
looks really nice so eve we're going to

394
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,958
address the same thing right now we're

395
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,278
going to do is we're going to

396
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,198
take the clones as well as trim the

397
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:45,759
flower trim the plant back a little bit

398
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,198
so

399
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,559
doing them together just makes sense so

400
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,240
what we're going to do is just kind of

401
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,359
kind of take it from the end and you can

402
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,240
see there's a couple little

403
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,560
plants here or little little stems here

404
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,799
that

405
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,239
just aren't getting the light they're

406
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,359
taking energy more than they're

407
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,720
providing

408
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,039
so we're going to do since we're in here

409
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,639
we'll just kind of snip that back

410
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:10,879
we'll snip that back snip that

411
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,839
that as well and we're going to just

412
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:16,078
take this whole thing here

413
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,760
you can see it's a it's it's it's a nice

414
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,399
it's a nice cut

415
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,120
so and what i'd like to do is usually

416
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,039
kind of find

417
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,720
an area where you're going to have some

418
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,000
nodes because there's some activity

419
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,399
going on there

420
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,440
and so from here i'll probably just take

421
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,559
the same

422
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,680
the same direction the leaf is spinning

423
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:38,719
and basically take that angle

424
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:41,759
i'll trim that off kind of

425
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,759
move that to the top

426
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:50,079
and so just made ourselves

427
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,439
a little clone and what we want to do is

428
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,679
just want to make sure we label it so we

429
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,199
know which plant we took it off

430
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,239
and uh not been excelling in the

431
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:02,719
labeling

432
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,120
arena so yeah labeling is always the

433
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,720
easiest hardest oh we have the shark

434
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,440
it's literally true i haven't i don't

435
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,120
even know

436
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,279
what's here i wouldn't know what to

437
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,078
write grab the sharpie

438
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,879
and so where's the short hair uh

439
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:16,479
somewhere

440
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,919
oh it's right it's on the table you know

441
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,839
that's a nice clone right there you can

442
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,078
put that in a uh

443
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,880
a rapid router or you can put it in a

444
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,638
clone

445
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,399
but you can see we've taken the uh the

446
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,639
45 mark here

447
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,440
and without what i'll usually do is i'll

448
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,120
i usually would dip it in some tea

449
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,160
organics alive tea you could do that but

450
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,839
i'll give it just a little bit of

451
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:40,480
moisture

452
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,560
and i'll even spray the end now uh

453
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,159
is that just water yeah it will and

454
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,359
we'll get that we'll send that video you

455
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,120
guys can watch the video there is a

456
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,000
video where we'll actually dunk this in

457
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,679
tea

458
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,679
and that'll help kind of clean up some

459
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,719
of the cut areas so disease

460
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,679
uh pathogens don't breed there and then

461
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,120
also as

462
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:01,359
a hormone as well we'll dip it in uh

463
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,560
the microbial solution and then we'll

464
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,639
dip it in fpf

465
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,719
and there's a video on that but for now

466
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,399
this is all this is this this is another

467
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,399
way that's honestly it works

468
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,399
it works really well but just kind of

469
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,159
give it some moisture there

470
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,519
make sure you get a little bit on there

471
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,319
on the on the cut

472
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,679
as a hormone and then we're just going

473
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,879
to store this now we're just going to

474
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,559
store this we're not going to keep them

475
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,159
in here to root or clone

476
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,518
this is actually just storage like if

477
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,278
you're at a buddy's house and you're

478
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,480
going man let that thing smells great

479
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,439
let me get a piece of that there's

480
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,360
nothing around

481
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,480
this is what you do you just take it you

482
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,959
cut it

483
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,320
you place it in a bag where you can get

484
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,879
a little bit of

485
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,000
humidity it'll and just kind of store in

486
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,519
a cooler place

487
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,679
now this one is going to be a little bit

488
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,360
longer than we'd like

489
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,359
so what usually you get a bigger bag

490
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,120
if you want yeah we can do that this way

491
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,719
we can keep the cut where the node was

492
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,679
now you can it's not going to hurt it

493
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,160
look it

494
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,719
this plant is so resilient it can it

495
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,759
really

496
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,320
live through almost anything you could

497
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,839
just take a cut from here as well it

498
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,600
should work just as well

499
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,880
that's just just something we've done

500
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,639
through experience and

501
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,319
and just something that we've been doing

502
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,280
forever so we tend to

503
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,038
what works for us we just continue we

504
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,240
continue that sop basically

505
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:17,838
and so that's something that works for

506
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,480
us but tom's got a bigger bag so it's

507
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,480
perfect so

508
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,399
get that and then thanks and then also

509
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,079
your wife's gonna be making sandwiches

510
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,038
tomorrow for the family and

511
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:35,279
be like where are the sandwich bags

512
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,200
i actually just what uh do you use the

513
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,960
paper towel and why do you cut the edges

514
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,000
what is the purpose what is that um you

515
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,240
know there's so much

516
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,599
there's a lot of uh there's a lot of

517
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,919
grow science

518
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,678
whether it's factual or not factual or

519
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,840
experience or just time

520
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,000
over over the the years we've actually

521
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,639
cut the cut the ends off

522
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,160
redirect transpiration there's there's

523
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,038
some science to that a lot of people

524
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,240
don't do it

525
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:59,919
some people do it it's just something

526
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,798
we've been doing forever you know

527
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,440
there's probably some

528
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:03,839
some some very very smart people that'll

529
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,000
tell you

530
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,759
exactly the reason why or why not to do

531
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,200
it but just for experience

532
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,879
this is uh this is something we've done

533
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,080
a really long time and it works

534
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,799
so i've i've actually done i put some

535
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,720
fpf

536
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,038
a little bit of fpf in here and then

537
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,558
i'll we've also put it in the bag

538
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,000
and then i'll lay that right there

539
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,079
all right so let's get that in the shade

540
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,919
and then i'll root it yeah and we can

541
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,599
label that we can label it and just yeah

542
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,000
so this should be plant one

543
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,519
plant one off so this is where that's

544
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,319
yeah and we could cut another one and

545
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,759
put another one in there

546
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:39,839
before you want them you know i've had a

547
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,480
mail to me from across the country

548
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,918
um you know they're they're and as long

549
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,759
as you can

550
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,600
get them back into an area where they're

551
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,679
gonna like you could probably get

552
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,119
a good one day or two days or three days

553
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,559
in there uh but

554
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,239
generally if you can get to the hydro

555
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,240
store and get it you know get the proper

556
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,759
materials that's probably gonna be the

557
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,798
best the best bet

558
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:03,359
tom that thing will be in

559
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,960
a plug in two hours yeah and if it's a

560
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,079
plug that's perfect and so we'll do is

561
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,600
since we're

562
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:11,119
let's just make sure we got enough

563
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:12,719
so here's another one and we're just

564
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,918
going to snip it

565
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,519
and you can see and why we were

566
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,520
discussing earlier you can see actually

567
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,558
a little bit of hair

568
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:23,440
coming out of this one here so we're

569
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:25,519
just going to keep our eyes on that

570
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,640
you know so you see the hair is tom yes

571
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,798
so there's a little bit there's a little

572
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,400
bit of hair so

573
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,960
it's just something we want to keep our

574
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,960
eye on

575
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,119
and make sure this one doesn't turn

576
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,679
female also seeds sometimes

577
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,199
become completely symmetrical and

578
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,120
there's a three pack on there so it's

579
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,480
something that's that's a trait also to

580
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:49,759
look at and then

581
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,759
you can almost see a little

582
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:56,720
preliminary male

583
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,240
part but it's not certain yet so we're

584
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,640
just going to keep our eye on it and see

585
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,000
what

586
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,000
uh what transpires here and tom which

587
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,679
plants is this

588
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,038
this is plant number two this is plant

589
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,440
number one we're still on plant number

590
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,038
one

591
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,640
we're still in plant number one because

592
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,679
really yeah you took it from so we're

593
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,159
just going to take

594
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,919
another 45 clip the ends there

595
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,440
take a snip off the top just kind of

596
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,840
re-examine it

597
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,600
maybe take a couple here and snip this

598
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,558
also provides a little bit of space too

599
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,480
between clones

600
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,399
so they're not actually everybody rotate

601
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,720
90 or 180

602
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,798
there we go tom always know where your

603
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,400
camera is

604
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,319
back to the camera there so here's

605
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,240
another one we'll throw in that same bag

606
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,439
tom we'll just give it a little

607
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,440
just give it a little rinse

608
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,320
perfect give it a little rinse deeper

609
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,919
breathing

610
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:51,119
off the ends there perfect and i think

611
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,400
two for that plant

612
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,399
should i put this into the other side

613
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,240
yeah i put in the same the same bag

614
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,240
or plant number one

615
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,440
and we'll keep we'll keep these you know

616
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,960
i like these these are these are

617
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,960
these are tall they're large what we can

618
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,919
do is kind of just go in and

619
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,360
let's just kind of eliminate some of the

620
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,080
burden

621
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,279
on the plant they take up a lot of

622
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,480
energy

623
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:23,200
the sun is the shade is not getting

624
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:26,400
directly to there but the tops are still

625
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,919
really nice so we're good there

626
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,759
you know there's and there's all sorts

627
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,880
of different ways tom i mean

628
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,480
if you don't if you feel like they're

629
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,840
getting too tall you don't necessarily

630
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,360
have to top them you could have talked

631
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,720
them a little earlier but

632
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,879
you know cannabis is so uh

633
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,480
it's malleable right i mean everybody

634
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,799
can grow so differently

635
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,960
and achieve something similar so on

636
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:50,079
these if you'd like you could really

637
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,480
you can kind of just bend them over you

638
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,319
know

639
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,599
just take a trellis and begin to kind of

640
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:54,240
bend them over a little bit and you

641
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,439
could do that

642
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,720
after a foliar after a watering plus a

643
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,919
foliar spray

644
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,519
and in them and in the morning and so

645
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,200
if you just and if you don't mind it

646
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,798
coming out here a little bit

647
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,640
then you could just you know just bend

648
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,679
that over like sometimes in the sun it's

649
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,520
a little bit

650
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,880
a little bit harder for it but when when

651
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,158
you first water you really you know you

652
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,280
see that kind of that

653
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,159
that are a little more flexible so stick

654
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,839
it through the trouble

655
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,799
yeah so what we'll do is like we'll come

656
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,319
in i don't know if you guys are going to

657
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,200
do a trellis segment but we can come in

658
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,359
and trellis it

659
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,840
um i'd probably do it right away yeah

660
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,519
before transit before transition because

661
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:30,879
you're going to get a multiply effect on

662
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,319
the stretch

663
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,320
so we definitely want to do that you

664
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,918
know the next few days or next week

665
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,359
and just and you can just bend that over

666
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:42,240
like this a little bit

667
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,240
and what oh i just snapped it gotta

668
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,120
but what we want to do is see i didn't

669
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,038
snap it all the way

670
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:52,639
so there are break methods as well so

671
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,599
it's actually that'll probably end up

672
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,280
being a very strong part of the plant

673
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,038
but we could do plant well thank you

674
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,119
yeah it will honestly

675
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,158
sometimes yeah sometimes and that's why

676
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,000
watering it

677
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,440
and do it in the morning and so this is

678
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,919
kind of just this is learning this is a

679
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,919
learning

680
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,000
learning situation for us here but you

681
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,440
can see just the inside cambium is

682
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,319
broken yeah there's no tear on the

683
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,759
outside

684
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,678
right so what we can do is if you want

685
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,279
to take a little bit of a green strap

686
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,919
you can just kind of miyagi it a little

687
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,759
bit

688
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,038
on the and kind of keep it tight make

689
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,558
sure we're good

690
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:23,839
but that's generally what you want to do

691
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,279
is just kind of bend them bend them all

692
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,319
over a little bit

693
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:30,158
and uh and sort it out

694
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,839
yeah just kind of out and underneath and

695
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,200
then everything's because then all this

696
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:37,678
inside yeah it's going to be able to

697
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,120
come up and so so without topping that's

698
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,360
another way you can

699
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,959
now i have a uh what's going on over

700
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,158
here so these are just old leaves you

701
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,278
know like we're then that's where

702
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,960
there's a second stall yeah so so these

703
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,278
are so basically

704
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,079
right now is a good time so these are

705
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:53,119
all

706
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,439
the reason they're just not getting

707
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,158
enough sun you know they're everything's

708
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,400
trying to

709
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,000
reach to a new growth new protein

710
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,120
development so honestly we're just

711
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,038
we're going to get rid of all this

712
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:07,119
bottom scruff

713
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,400
so funny i could have sworn that this

714
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,359
this one i didn't think was going to

715
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,320
survive

716
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:14,479
was so puny for so long and tom what

717
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,599
plant number are we on now we were just

718
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,839
on number one

719
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,639
well are we going clockwise i would say

720
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,319
let's go number

721
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,080
let's call this one two and then we can

722
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:23,359
go three and four

723
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,519
i could have sworn it was a different

724
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,038
strain from the others

725
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,720
but you're saying everything here is the

726
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,720
same peter

727
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,359
yes

728
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,320
yeah so there you go so now you have a

729
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,599
clean

730
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:42,480
you're real clean here you know

731
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,359
uh oh it's all right honestly this is

732
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,960
this is gonna be a

733
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,038
what could i get this is actually gonna

734
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,880
be really cool we can get a stake

735
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,558
and then uh and then we can get like a

736
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,039
little green tape

737
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:53,918
that would be helpful but honestly this

738
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,119
may seem

739
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,880
like an issue but really it's uh the

740
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,079
plant will thank us because

741
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,880
there are some more intermediate and

742
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:08,000
expert type of

743
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,159
grow methods one of them being

744
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,679
breaking the stem now again you don't

745
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,840
want to you don't want to break it

746
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,600
too much it's more of a turn and snap

747
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,439
uh you can even i mean if you want to

748
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,839
get close and try to hear it even

749
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,919
come to come come you you can put your

750
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:29,839
finger right here tom

751
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,840
oh that's our head watch this

752
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,879
yeah you hear that yeah okay so the

753
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,679
inside yeah the inside snap

754
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,520
yeah right so there's these are all ways

755
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,278
that you can uh does not work

756
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,639
yeah we need a little bit tall oh we

757
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:44,558
need taller

758
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,480
steak but we can get that we can get

759
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,639
that going

760
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,240
yeah but you'll notice that do you have

761
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,080
any long pieces of bamboo

762
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,759
this will call us out and actually

763
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,798
become stronger

764
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,798
your squirrels

765
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,278
not the outside but the inside those

766
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,640
areas are actually callous up

767
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:07,839
and become strong so trellising over

768
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,159
or bending arms over is the first stage

769
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,240
it's not too it's not going to do it

770
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,440
it's actually the first stage to

771
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,919
uh the the tricks and tips

772
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,600
to increase yield breaking stems you

773
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,880
know these are old school ways that have

774
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,439
been around for a long time

775
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,960
a long time that uh that increase the

776
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,400
yield

777
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,240
so we've done a little cleaning we've

778
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,798
taken a lot of clones

779
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,319
um taking a couple clones did we clone

780
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:36,319
we didn't do we take a clone

781
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:38,158
you know i um leave it like this

782
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:39,759
because there there aren't tons of

783
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,520
stocks right now

784
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,679
this one might be a better candidate

785
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,400
number three honestly i like the way

786
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,720
this one

787
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,798
the structure is on this one you do yeah

788
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,240
i i i like this one

789
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,278
um i you know usually i wouldn't want to

790
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,000
take a clone

791
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,960
just off of three but really i want to

792
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,079
make sure we do

793
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,919
keep this in stock so i'll probably

794
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:07,839
end up i'll just take a little clone off

795
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,840
this one

796
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:21,359
i thought i had another steak somewhere

797
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:23,278
i might have used

798
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,119
this will be actually a very good part

799
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:28,398
of the segment here

800
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,398
so we'll keep that going

801
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,839
but this one actually looks it looks

802
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,839
like something we can

803
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,200
yes

804
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,519
come check this out right here and look

805
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,519
how

806
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,599
look how thick that stock is right there

807
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,679
coming up

808
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,319
almost looks like it was topped

809
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,320
naturally

810
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:59,119
that's beautiful i love growing from

811
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:03,839
seed so basically we're just going to

812
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,839
kind of get rid of this

813
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,120
and then from here

814
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,880
and then

815
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:31,839
there we go take off the rest of those

816
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:31,840
there and then we'll give it

817
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,710
[Laughter]

818
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,320
so we can keep this some moisture on

819
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:42,319
this one as well

820
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,640
how about do you have any string that we

821
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,720
could tie it to the one of the

822
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,240
caddy corner ones what's this here uh

823
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,519
well that's that's just a

824
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,798
we can uh we can use that i had that in

825
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,398
here actually

826
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,398
it was going right in there to

827
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,839
all right this is plant number two

828
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:20,798
we can use this and i have to go

829
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,798
get find some tape uh

830
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,079
you're gonna get a little root break in

831
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,079
here but again it

832
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,199
right these plants are tough they're

833
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,639
tougher than nails

834
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,880
so this plant was so happy 20 minutes

835
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,880
ago

836
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,360
it's getting beat up but the fuck it's

837
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,960
gonna love it it really is

838
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:42,879
this is going to be the biggest the

839
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,720
biggest and the earliest of them all

840
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,320
actually so then we'll just strap them

841
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,519
together like that

842
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:49,519
it'll be like it never happened

843
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:56,240
perfect all right so we got plant number

844
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,240
two

845
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,840
yeah you can tell some of these just i

846
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,840
only have black tape

847
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,839
perfect

848
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:23,839
clean these off

849
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:31,839
we'll do is we'll save that for a clone

850
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,840
save that for a clone

851
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,640
and you can take the yeah the cannabis

852
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:40,959
leaves and just

853
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,000
you can just top dress them if you like

854
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,120
now should we there

855
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,960
should we be putting some more of your

856
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,719
soil yeah we can definitely do a top

857
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,319
dress like after we after we

858
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,240
go through all the stress of the plan of

859
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,158
trimming it and cloning it i think

860
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,319
breaking it appreciate it yeah breaking

861
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,159
it yeah we can definitely add some some

862
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:02,000
beneficial biology

863
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:06,240
and uh yeah they'll thank us so

864
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,558
that's plant number three yep

865
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,558
cut that cut that back

866
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:36,480
you cut a piece for me here

867
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:40,079
now will this um impede our uh

868
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,360
trellising at this point this one will

869
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,960
probably impede a little bit of the

870
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,879
trellising the rest of them you can you

871
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,720
can bend over

872
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,480
this one honestly you could take the

873
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,558
steak off and trellis it

874
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,679
and then and then i gotcha and then kind

875
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:53,440
of all right

876
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,399
but we might do that as another segment

877
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,399
amend it and uh

878
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,399
that was there so we have a couple more

879
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,000
clones so so the type the size of

880
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,398
trellis i would want to get would be

881
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,919
just like a yeah they make a little four

882
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:08,798
by four like a four by four

883
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,480
we have the trellising for these but we

884
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,639
would need to

885
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,679
change that yeah we need to add a top

886
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,880
one so i think just

887
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,640
actually we could just stick a steak

888
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,120
yeah inside yeah simple steak just tie

889
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,960
it in

890
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,959
yeah it's really easy just something

891
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,038
anything to keep them

892
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,000
bent yeah keep them from you know just

893
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:28,640
kind of

894
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,038
keeping them bent keeping them

895
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,240
so and then anytime we're getting all

896
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,798
these ones that aren't really getting

897
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,798
any sun

898
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:43,840
kind of redirect and transfer that

899
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,839
energy to the ones that are

900
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,239
now so the preferable topping would be

901
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,759
done at

902
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,880
like two three weeks um yeah you would

903
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,519
gauge the plant

904
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,799
but generally like the first uh like

905
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,440
this after the seventh

906
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,158
node would be a would be a good time to

907
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,679
to top

908
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,679
just kind of given the formation of the

909
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,240
plant as well so that's

910
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,440
that's uh that's a good indication and

911
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,120
then from the seventh

912
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,480
then you can start to kind of arm out a

913
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,839
little bit and then easier to

914
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,960
to to trellis and top out

915
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,519
again especially with seeds you know

916
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,000
they grow

917
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,200
they just go real straight and tall

918
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,519
clones sometimes

919
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,440
depending on the genetics sometimes

920
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,558
clones don't even need to be

921
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,240
uh topped or trellised just depends on

922
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,839
the genetics there's some

923
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,240
really indicas that are that are really

924
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:40,319
bushy and

925
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,880
uh and short to begin with a lot of the

926
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:46,079
anything kind of crossed with the og kb

927
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,640
is going to be definitely bushy

928
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,599
and then things like uh tall you know

929
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,679
some things like

930
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:53,038
tahoe g or ogs you want you definitely

931
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,440
want to trellis

932
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:56,720
any kind of ggs they definitely want to

933
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,720
be trellised

934
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,240
um can you tell that but from the

935
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,360
distance between the nodes

936
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,399
is that uh indication of

937
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,559
what uh the size or the type of the

938
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,480
pushiness yeah exactly like you'll

939
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,279
you'll see that sativas

940
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,000
they stretch they stretch big so

941
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,359
definitely

942
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,679
when they're when they're growing tall

943
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,239
like that sativas will definitely need

944
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,679
to be trellised because they're they're

945
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,559
not only are they tall but they're heavy

946
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,440
yielders

947
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,639
and so the second they start to get big

948
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,559
they'll start to

949
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,079
you know they'll start toppling over and

950
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,679
so they'll they'll want something to

951
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,119
hold them up and this way about those

952
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,280
round the round

953
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,800
things those tomato things yeah i used

954
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
to use those yeah those are those are

955
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,560
okay

956
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,320
the only thing with those is just

957
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:41,838
depending on how you cure

958
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,440
you're gonna have to do two different

959
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:44,159
ways one is you're gonna have to snip it

960
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,000
and kind of

961
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,398
pull that thing out and if your nugs are

962
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,559
too big then they're going to be trapped

963
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,398
so there's yeah but there's also other

964
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,199
circular ones that don't have the

965
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:56,638
the grate they're just the circle and

966
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,759
then those you can actually put in and

967
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,680
kind of tie to it

968
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,200
so those are really good but these

969
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:02,719
you'll you'll notice your trellis is

970
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:06,078
probably going to be multi-level

971
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:09,279
as they grow so depending on you know

972
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,960
your how you want them to to to

973
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,040
grow that will be determined on your

974
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,960
trellising too so the trellising you can

975
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:16,559
you can bend them over really really

976
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,800
well

977
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,480
with those tomato ones those are almost

978
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,400
made really to actually

979
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,079
hold up uh stems

980
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,079
where trellis you can actually train the

981
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,720
stems so

982
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,240
a couple different ways yeah so these

983
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:33,519
look pretty clean

984
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,039
you know generally i don't like to go

985
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:36,559
too far up but again a lot of people

986
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,079
have different ways of doing things you

987
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,440
know this is uh

988
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,200
you can tell just from the from sun down

989
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,039
it's clean and so now you're not going

990
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,199
to really get uh

991
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:48,400
you know you're not going to get a lot

992
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,159
of wasted energy

993
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,519
and or disease you know because there's

994
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,440
places that don't

995
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,639
that don't get a lot of sun you could

996
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,320
possibly get a little bit of disease so

997
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,559
i'm just going to go in and give

998
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,920
everybody a little

999
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:05,920
this is from number three okay where i

1000
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:13,838
cut

1001
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:13,838
but let him clean it up

1002
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,920
and talk to tom about spraying water

1003
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,480
onto the leaves at

1004
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,200
high noon yeah so right now you know the

1005
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,079
segment was

1006
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,759
it was good for a foliar but we want to

1007
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,280
do is we want to always

1008
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,280
follow your first thing in the if you're

1009
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,560
outdoor you want to you want to

1010
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,440
foliar in the mornings definitely

1011
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:37,759
high noon a little tougher for the plant

1012
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,240
if it's windy you can get away with it

1013
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,000
you know but generally uh the rule is

1014
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,039
that the little balls

1015
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,440
of water magnify the sun and kind of

1016
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,838
give

1017
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,519
a little bit of a burn so usually

1018
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,719
mornings is going to be the best

1019
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:54,960
best time to foliar and you can foliar

1020
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,639
all over the top of the leaves and

1021
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,800
underneath and i'm following these

1022
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,559
because when they're not really

1023
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,320
these are all still in the shade you

1024
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,078
know and we just made some cuts

1025
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,838
and i like to just i always like to just

1026
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,480
add a little bit of nutrients

1027
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,078
where the cuts are again this is just

1028
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,920
there's so many ways to do things you

1029
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,839
know and these are just ways that

1030
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,280
we we're doing this the organics yeah i

1031
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:16,159
mean these are different ways we've

1032
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,440
realized

1033
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:20,879
that work for us and so this is uh

1034
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,920
this is one of them so now you have some

1035
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,720
clean plants ready to be trellised

1036
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,920
uh clean yeah they look good they look

1037
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,159
really good

1038
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,639
i'm interested to see what that one does

1039
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:36,639
okay so let's bag up three

1040
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:39,679
so this is number three so

1041
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:41,759
and already you can see how fast

1042
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,519
once they're cut how fast they remember

1043
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,920
that one we were just doing

1044
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,838
and this was maybe it that one we

1045
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,240
snipped went straight to the bag

1046
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:52,239
this one we waited like five minutes

1047
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,919
yeah if that you know and you can see

1048
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:55,519
the waters already starting to drain out

1049
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,358
so this is this is definitely a

1050
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:58,880
sensitive situation

1051
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,880
uh we want to make sure we get them

1052
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,680
where they need to be as soon as

1053
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,519
possible

1054
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,759
because they will perk up they will perk

1055
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:08,320
back up

1056
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,760
but you can see already the leaves are

1057
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,440
beginning to

1058
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:19,599
to curl out losing water

1059
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:23,519
so we'll want to

1060
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:25,519
still have a little spf left in here

1061
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:26,719
that's where we need the intense

1062
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:32,239
dramatic music

1063
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:33,439
i know this is a race for time right now

1064
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:35,358
you know what we're going to do is just

1065
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:46,079
kind of dip

1066
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:49,199
dip that bottom into that

1067
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,519
that back up put her out of the sun

1068
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,519
over there

1069
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:02,000
want to cool her down right away

1070
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,000
oh we don't know it could be a hem

1071
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,519
and then this one i think can go or a

1072
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,920
hermit

1073
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,920
yeah or

1074
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:19,679
yeah hermes definitely

1075
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,040
is not what you want because sometimes

1076
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,440
when you when you

1077
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:24,800
look at the top and you're going all

1078
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,119
right i got a

1079
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,119
i got a female and megan

1080
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:38,078
yeah so even though the plant is

1081
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,079
starting to flower

1082
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,838
you still want to look at the lower

1083
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,440
parts of the plant

1084
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,199
because that's really where you're going

1085
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,679
to see her

1086
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:51,279
hermaphodite traits and that's one of

1087
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,759
the reasons why we cleaned

1088
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,480
yeah so we can try to so where where are

1089
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,599
we looking

1090
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,960
when you're looking at when you're

1091
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,160
trying to look for males or

1092
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,920
hermaphrodites

1093
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,159
start don't start at the top start at

1094
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,800
the bottom and so because that's really

1095
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:04,879
where

1096
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,318
the shaded area is really where where

1097
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,480
hermaphrodites grow

1098
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:09,838
that's where their traits are and and

1099
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,358
when you're walking you just kind of

1100
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,279
look to the top you go oh wow it's

1101
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,279
flowering i have no seeds

1102
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,319
no male traits or anything like that you

1103
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,160
walk away

1104
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:19,440
you think you've you've done an

1105
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,000
expection

1106
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,679
but really you got to get low and you

1107
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,079
got to just kind of look at all your

1108
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,199
corners really carefully i mean it is

1109
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,079
something that you really

1110
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:31,679
have to be aware of especially growing

1111
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,039
from seed because you could ruin

1112
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,960
what are the signs of hermaphrodite

1113
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,159
hermaphrodites it's it's almost like a

1114
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,760
flower but then

1115
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:42,078
there's a male parts

1116
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,079
essentially balls coming out uh from

1117
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,880
that and if those pop

1118
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,760
then your whole crop will turn uh become

1119
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,400
seeded

1120
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,520
and so it essentially ruins the entire

1121
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,000
crop

1122
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:55,920
so hermaphrodites are i mean if you've

1123
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,318
got a male and that pops well then

1124
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,760
it could possibly be a fun experiment

1125
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:02,239
for next round

1126
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,520
uh but hermaphadites are something you

1127
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,078
do not want

1128
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,800
breeders and growers definitely be wait

1129
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,480
is that

1130
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,800
is that three as well that three as well

1131
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,039
yep two on each yep

1132
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,039
so

1133
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:23,279
what was this in the little one

1134
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,839
oh that was this one here two the single

1135
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,839
number two

1136
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:36,480
yeah so herms are no no

1137
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,880
and breeders should really and then are

1138
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,318
there seeds more likely to

1139
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,440
have hermaphroditic traits as well

1140
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,318
like if a hermit pollinates a bunch of

1141
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,240
other plants

1142
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,800
versus a male pollinating a bunch of

1143
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,559
females you're going to get herms

1144
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,920
those seeds will also so you're going to

1145
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,599
be like propagating

1146
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,519
you're turning you're herman after

1147
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,000
herman yeah it's really

1148
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:00,960
i mean some will tell you different but

1149
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,800
i

1150
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,960
so that would be you know go you know

1151
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,800
that's what it is that's why herbs are

1152
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,079
the worst because if you have a male and

1153
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,039
you don't see it which they're really

1154
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,359
easy to tell

1155
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,358
herms terms sneak up on you yeah

1156
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:18,000
it's very sad what is that this is

1157
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:21,199
number four four

1158
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,838
yep number four last one oh let me get a

1159
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,199
bigger bag

1160
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,199
okay see that there

1161
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,480
yeah herms are really uh

1162
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:32,960
they're they're definitely problem

1163
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,960
causers

1164
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,719
so this one's just going to be a little

1165
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,719
shorter

1166
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,920
than i'd like but sometimes

1167
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,519
just got to work with the sorry i got to

1168
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,639
use these big bags for uh

1169
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:48,719
we're taking clowns off

1170
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:50,078
yeah so growing from seed it's

1171
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,480
definitely

1172
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,440
you gotta just kind of be on top of the

1173
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,679
garden

1174
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,679
you know walk the garden inspect the

1175
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:59,919
garden

1176
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:02,078
but i think it's a lot of fun because

1177
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,838
you can get

1178
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,280
well and if you're just gonna at a home

1179
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:07,199
grow a scale it's like

1180
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,280
it's totally manageable it's easy to do

1181
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,639
exactly it's really fun

1182
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,839
with tom's four plants right four and

1183
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:15,759
then

1184
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:17,838
yeah you know and if you're growing with

1185
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,680
seed you know i like to grow

1186
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:23,519
kind of uh at least 25 sometimes 50

1187
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,519
percent more plants

1188
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,119
because it sets you up for if you have

1189
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,639
males you still have the plant count

1190
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,920
that you need

1191
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,480
i just put number four in this one

1192
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,039
oh it's fit well i'll just what i'll do

1193
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,639
is i'll

1194
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:39,039
i got a bigger one here if you want to

1195
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:41,039
just put them both in one bag

1196
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,079
so yeah we definitely want to get these

1197
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:43,519
to where they're going i want to put a

1198
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,079
little that in here too

1199
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:46,079
right away

1200
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:54,559
but you know the ways we're doing it

1201
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:59,598
right here are

1202
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:03,679
oh number four number four look at that

1203
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:09,838
this is a professional backyard outfit

1204
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:09,838
we were on a tight ship back here

1205
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,200
it's like wind extra plants tom actually

1206
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:19,358
controls six houses on this block and

1207
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,879
he's running indoor grows in all six

1208
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:22,880
that's right a helicopter

1209
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,039
yeah so there there you go you gotta you

1210
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,359
got a couple of some

1211
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:33,039
cleaned up right here wow look at this

1212
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:34,239
you got some cleaned up plants you got

1213
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,079
one that's gonna be

1214
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:37,759
pretty awesome no i didn't water i

1215
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,880
haven't watered for two days knowing you

1216
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,800
were coming

1217
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,640
your your watering is fine again these

1218
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,920
beds are so

1219
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:45,920
they're really nice because you just

1220
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,440
don't need a water they retain so well

1221
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,760
and that's why we have the granular in

1222
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,960
there

1223
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,800
so you're always going to get some sort

1224
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,159
of nitrogen the plants you know what

1225
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,800
i've noticed

1226
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,679
after we've put some other smaller beds

1227
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,760
together was

1228
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,279
this one is like really aerated i can

1229
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,520
tell when i go down there's

1230
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,480
it's like it's looser there's just more

1231
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:06,159
room it's

1232
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,240
denser in like and i assumed it was your

1233
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:09,679
the soil that the castings are dense

1234
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,838
yeah you don't really don't need

1235
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:13,838
temperatures yeah yeah they're kicking

1236
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:16,318
but it was your premium

1237
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:19,838
your premium that we didn't have can you

1238
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,838
tell me was it your premium

1239
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,160
soil that adds the the air or the room

1240
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,760
uh that's that's actually the premium mx

1241
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:29,358
is uh vegetable compost and worm

1242
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,440
castings and minerals so

1243
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,199
well what is it that makes this lighter

1244
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,358
than um i believe

1245
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,279
yeah on this one we had the bergen which

1246
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,119
was a peat it was fluffed it up

1247
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,280
and then you know the fox farm we used

1248
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,200
on this one was the ocean forest

1249
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,280
okay the happy frog is a little bit more

1250
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:48,239
dense a little more rich

1251
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,760
um it has more animal byproduct uh in it

1252
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:51,358
where the ocean forest is more and i

1253
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,280
went and bought some ocean forest and we

1254
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,199
used that in some of these other ones

1255
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,760
but it was it was must have been the

1256
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,118
yeah yeah you can do that with a lot of

1257
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,280
different things too like you can blend

1258
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,000
a fox farm with a uh

1259
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,280
with a basement mix or something just to

1260
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,679
fluff it out just that's all yeah you

1261
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,440
know i blend sometimes i blend the 707

1262
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:11,759
with the og planting mix

1263
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,880
you know uh the other day we needed

1264
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,160
something on the fly

1265
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,000
really couldn't wait for hydro stores so

1266
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,159
the nursery down the line sent us sun

1267
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,440
pro and happy frost so if you're going

1268
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,318
to hydro store what's a good

1269
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,280
a good aerating brand i like i like to

1270
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,480
use

1271
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,720
route 707 okay i like that one a lot the

1272
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,679
the what's the percentage is that like a

1273
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:34,480
20

1274
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,358
that you add that that with with the

1275
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,159
root 707 i like to add about 10 to 15

1276
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,199
percent of the

1277
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:42,799
of the premium mix in there and that'll

1278
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:45,679
that'll just add your biology add your

1279
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,800
carbon nitrogen ratio 30 to one

1280
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:50,318
and then just make it some minerals make

1281
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,960
it really really healthy again with the

1282
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:54,559
biology but that 707 i think has a

1283
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,679
really good aeration

1284
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:59,599
blend that goes well with castings

1285
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:01,118
and vegetable compost because if you

1286
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,318
start off with something like

1287
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,880
uh fox farm and you don't have a berger

1288
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:07,759
or another peat source or a royal source

1289
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,200
or something to

1290
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,880
to kind of make that as you were saying

1291
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,239
fluffier then

1292
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,800
you're going to it's actually going to

1293
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,118
go more dense and so you'll water less

1294
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,359
but

1295
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,400
again in sun like this either one should

1296
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:20,000
be okay

1297
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,160
you know what i mean again there's

1298
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,400
different ways to do everything but

1299
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:25,920
generally that's our you know the

1300
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,639
fluffiness so you can water a little bit

1301
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,680
more as well

1302
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:33,118
well then the royal gold i brought the

1303
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:35,118
tuper because it's uh basically i told

1304
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,358
him we wanted to build our own soil yeah

1305
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,519
so we just wanted something that is airy

1306
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:40,159
yeah and that tuper is really nice to do

1307
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,280
that

1308
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:45,279
okay so we got our so first of all with

1309
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,200
the with these plants like what do you

1310
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,119
like about each one

1311
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,318
like start with plant number one what i

1312
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,480
like i like the health

1313
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:54,480
i definitely like the health that's one

1314
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,240
thing except for afterwards

1315
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,519
yeah afterwards after we tore this one

1316
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,439
up but uh

1317
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:01,358
i i like the health i really like the

1318
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,559
turgidity i like the way the plants are

1319
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:04,960
i like the color

1320
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,519
you can see the colors really nice i

1321
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,000
like what does this nice color tell us

1322
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:11,119
that it's

1323
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,880
that about about these plants

1324
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,400
well the color indicates a lot because

1325
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,200
if you had any discoloration you have

1326
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,720
deficiencies

1327
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:18,318
straight off the bat so right now these

1328
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:21,199
being such is it the nutrients

1329
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:21,759
yeah nutrients the soil the sun the

1330
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,598
water

1331
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,599
everything being done right now from

1332
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,960
when we started until this point has

1333
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,920
been done really well

1334
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,800
so this way uh you know you you have you

1335
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,838
know you

1336
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,359
the the bend there is really nice you'll

1337
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:37,039
see like if you grow with

1338
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:38,960
uh sometimes if you grow with just

1339
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:42,239
synthetics with not a

1340
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:45,199
uh a nutrient-rich soil you actually get

1341
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:48,159
flatter less detergent leaves you'll

1342
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:50,639
still get good nugs but now um

1343
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:52,719
triple digits like a week ago i got

1344
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:55,279
these little spots down here

1345
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,159
they went away i'm not not on these down

1346
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,559
here

1347
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:59,920
and it contrary to rumor i haven't been

1348
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,359
watering them during

1349
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,200
midday sun so but what is this

1350
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:06,719
you did that one day i remember i came

1351
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,558
over and you're like it was early

1352
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:10,078
it was earlier than that it was really

1353
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,640
but what is this when they're

1354
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,559
discoloring on the leaf that's uh it's

1355
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:17,199
not any bug

1356
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,760
you know i don't think it's a leaf miner

1357
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:19,199
it ha

1358
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,440
this is the only plant here that it

1359
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:23,838
happened to but it also the autos and it

1360
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:27,440
was the same thing the triple digit days

1361
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:29,279
then subsequent outgrowths improved

1362
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,358
okay could have just been really hot

1363
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,240
yeah it's been a really hot day but i

1364
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:37,358
don't see any indication of bugs or

1365
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:38,558
uh you know any kind of miners

1366
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:40,239
maybe do you have a little something

1367
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,359
there but again you're outdoors there's

1368
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:42,719
always gonna be something but good

1369
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:45,279
biology will keep the

1370
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:45,838
keep the okay keep it keep that

1371
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,880
infection

1372
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:50,880
low uh yeah

1373
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,318
you know there's so i think the colors

1374
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,920
looking good i think the structure on

1375
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:56,000
this one is actually looking really good

1376
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,119
i like this one a lot i think the nodes

1377
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,199
are a little bit tighter

1378
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,318
than the other seeds and seeds generally

1379
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:05,679
sorry number two

1380
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:08,880
oh oh jesus can you turn those off

1381
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:08,879
does that turn off at all

1382
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,039
yeah you gotta time these things to not

1383
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:16,318
be at one in the afternoon either

1384
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:17,079
yeah so we're getting a good foliar

1385
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:18,960
spray there

1386
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:20,639
[Laughter]

1387
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,240
all right the cool thing is i pulled it

1388
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:24,838
down a little bit yeah i have no idea

1389
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,959
when they're coming off let's bring that

1390
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:29,920
back

1391
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,519
perfect yeah so a couple things i would

1392
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,240
have done maybe in the beginning was uh

1393
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:35,599
maybe top

1394
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:38,078
a little bit sooner and then uh and

1395
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,760
and then the the power of the energy

1396
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,359
would focus on these a little bit

1397
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,880
probably tightening up the nodes but

1398
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:45,920
generally from here up it looks

1399
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,760
really nice and that's why i say if you

1400
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,119
get into the trellis everything will

1401
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,040
kind of everything will

1402
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,640
like not slow down but stop its vertical

1403
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,800
growth and kind of start to go

1404
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,159
horizontal a little bit and then if you

1405
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,400
if you trellis and all these

1406
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:01,519
interspacing nodes are going to start

1407
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,200
growing

1408
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:05,199
and so you're going to give yourself 20

1409
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:06,879
to 30 40 more arms

1410
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:09,039
per plant that's what we want that's

1411
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,039
what

1412
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,358
should we do a trellis segment yeah

1413
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,920
that's something we want to do well

1414
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:17,119
i i just and i can go get trellises

1415
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,599
usually

1416
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,039
but anyway that's just kind of i really

1417
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,920
just need to stick them in here and just

1418
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:25,119
kind of you know

1419
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,519
because it would basically like ideally

1420
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,559
like

1421
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:32,239
45 degrees uh to a point

1422
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:34,800
just before you break it gotcha okay

1423
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:36,239
yeah okay so they like to be a little

1424
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,000
stressed but a little bit

1425
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:40,159
yeah the stress on the on cannabis

1426
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,039
plants a certain type of stress that and

1427
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:43,118
if you can

1428
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,639
i i did something with this guy who

1429
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,838
actually has a trellis system that i'll

1430
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:49,519
bring over

1431
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:53,920
um but he he's like a professional

1432
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:57,119
bonsai competition contestant

1433
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:00,880
and he was like with bonsai

1434
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,519
it's like you're getting medieval on

1435
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,519
them yeah

1436
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:05,519
and you're bringing them just to before

1437
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:09,358
death yeah on like all these like

1438
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:11,199
vicious growth right yeah honestly

1439
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,679
your arm you'll see this you'll see a

1440
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:16,799
little one grown amongst them and like

1441
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:17,358
you'll treat her you know a little bit

1442
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,280
less

1443
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:21,358
than this one that's just so beautiful

1444
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,359
but you know what that little runty one

1445
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:24,558
usually is going to turn out because

1446
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:26,000
it's just been

1447
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,079
that's right you know what i mean yeah

1448
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,239
the adversity every time you walk by

1449
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:33,359
these smack them around

1450
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:35,519
well that would one amongst these

1451
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,358
that's this one this one that's the i

1452
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,039
really like the formation of this one

1453
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:40,318
i really like this is the run this one

1454
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,519
yeah it was the runt yeah i think these

1455
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:44,000
two are going to be your

1456
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:46,239
your winners this one's always been this

1457
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,159
one's probably going to be male uh

1458
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,679
that one's probably going to be male but

1459
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:50,318
we'll you know we'll get to that point

1460
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:54,879
again like

1461
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:54,880
totally be wrong and yeah this has males

1462
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:57,919
but they're hello they're looking

1463
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,440
they're they're great and then tom if

1464
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,960
you didn't want to trellis them

1465
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,480
i would just get a i would just get a

1466
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,400
couple more

1467
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:09,760
uh a couple more uh

1468
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,240
sticks and uh and time up

1469
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,440
so this way they can they can they're

1470
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:14,879
when they do

1471
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,200
they know they're getting some support

1472
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,400
so they'll grow bigger buds and then uh

1473
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:20,639
and then it'll just kind of hold

1474
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,720
everything in place okay so they're

1475
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,400
starting to get heavier so

1476
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,318
one way or another you need to sort of

1477
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,039
give them some support structure some

1478
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:29,519
training exactly

1479
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:31,039
tom we can do that next week no yeah so

1480
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:34,079
we haven't filmed that

1481
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:35,119
so but if say say we kept it with this

1482
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,359
with no trellis

1483
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,960
what would would that mean a taller it

1484
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:40,000
would just go taller yeah you'd probably

1485
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,400
end up with probably

1486
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,239
plants about this big okay yeah which is

1487
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,680
not bad about seven feet

1488
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,239
yeah probably about that big once they

1489
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:50,480
once they're flowering yeah

1490
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:51,679
they're about that big but that's all

1491
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,639
right it's still

1492
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:56,000
below the fence and i i like it it's fun

1493
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:57,679
to kind of see them like well i just

1494
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,679
downloaded all the regs this is

1495
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:03,519
actually tom are you excited perfect

1496
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:05,358
there's only one thing actually and we

1497
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,719
have some autos that'll be ready and

1498
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:09,119
actually let's look at this yeah let's

1499
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,480
look at these they should they'll start

1500
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,838
flowering because

1501
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,920
even though they're in a different

1502
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:15,119
environment i've been following all the

1503
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,440
same feeding

1504
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,039
regimen with these yeah these look great

1505
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,400
the structure's great i like how they're

1506
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:21,440
stout they probably have a little more

1507
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,559
indica

1508
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,720
in in them given that that stoutness but

1509
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,240
yeah the colors looking great oh you've

1510
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:29,199
done a great job tom they're they're

1511
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:33,199
really looking good

1512
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:34,960
now in terms of um stunting

1513
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:36,719
cutting trimming back and then and then

1514
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,240
these ones over there on the autos

1515
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:39,759
obviously i would leave

1516
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:42,479
like on the autos i would probably just

1517
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,160
do very very minor

1518
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,679
maybe maybe something just yeah just

1519
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:47,358
with the hands just kind of yeah

1520
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:48,719
some of these little little ones but

1521
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:50,239
with things with autos is

1522
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,078
you know autos really need to remain

1523
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:52,558
stress free gotcha you know they're

1524
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,720
really

1525
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,000
designed to be stress-free at least at

1526
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,318
least in my experience

1527
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,159
now is this its final home this is it's

1528
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:02,159
this this should be

1529
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:03,598
this should be uh because again the

1530
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:05,519
stress i mean

1531
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,960
i've seen i've seen people purchase

1532
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:09,039
thousands of autos

1533
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,480
from a greenhouse everything's fine they

1534
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:12,159
bring them to a place

1535
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,519
they give it just a little bit of stress

1536
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:15,759
and then they go into flour

1537
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,639
and i know from there that's right yeah

1538
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,520
it's well you

1539
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:20,719
you'd like to at least get as much veg

1540
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:22,719
out of them as possible because they

1541
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:25,279
tend to flower a little bit early

1542
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,318
but from seed once that seed is planted

1543
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,760
it's a home

1544
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:29,679
and you want to you want to keep the

1545
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,960
autos uh stress free

1546
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:32,960
i'm trying but they look like that's why

1547
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,480
i put them on these yeah

1548
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,720
so i wouldn't pick this up because every

1549
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,920
time you do you shift the dirt so now

1550
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:39,039
none of the dirt shifts

1551
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,960
because they're on they look they're

1552
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:42,880
little tommy you are so delicate yeah

1553
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,440

1554
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,440
