1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
[Music]

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:14,730
we're just gonna kick it off with some

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,278
breeding talk and genetics and then in

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,980
about 45 minutes we'll shift gears and

5
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:26,368
get legal and talk plant patents and IP

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:28,849
and fun stuff so Trevor this stage is

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,210
yours right on thank you Peter

8
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:35,460
so yeah I'm sitting here with two

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,189
incredibly well-versed individuals who

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,230
have been engaged in this industry and

11
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:42,329
you know before it was an industry

12
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,729
really have their roots going back to

13
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:49,590
when it was a community we've got Josh D

14
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:51,898
on my left hello everybody for those who

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,180
don't know Josh D is one of the people

16
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,579
who brought us all the ogee and we're

17
00:00:54,179 --> 00:01:00,019
all greatly appreciative out here on the

18
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,070
west coast so thank you man

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,469
well thanks for everyone out there to

20
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:09,390
keep growing her as much as she needs it

21
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:12,450
as LA needs OG indeed and on my right

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,569
I've got Mojave Richmond and Mojave he's

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,079
got incredible experience as well

24
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:21,438
breeder of the Sage long time experience

25
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,989
both here in the states and also

26
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,099
internationally which gives him a unique

27
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:30,060
perspective on everything that's going

28
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:34,530
down so right on yeah yeah pleasure to

29
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,629
be here everyone thank you so yeah I was

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,469
hoping that we could just get into a

31
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:42,750
discussion about the current state of

32
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:46,679
cannabis genetics let's talk about where

33
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,590
we've been where we're at right now what

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,079
is the cannabis genome as it currently

35
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,960
the state of the cannabis genome right

36
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,539
now and so to kick that off I think it

37
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,359
would probably be good for Mojave to go

38
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,219
first just cuz Mojave Mojave for anybody

39
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,239
who doesn't know works with Rob Clark

40
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:08,159
he's got lots of experience in terms of

41
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:10,348
talking with one of the foremost experts

42
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,049
and learning and understanding this

43
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:14,250
plant from somebody who really knows the

44
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,650
deep history of the play

45
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,069
and so yeah you want to start us off

46
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,200
sure right on well I guess to really

47
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:23,909
address where the cannabis genome is

48
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,780
today we got to talk about where it was

49
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:30,509
in the past and where it came from

50
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:34,650
cannabis is you know quite possibly the

51
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:36,870
most the most significant human plant

52
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,879
relationship is that between humans and

53
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,710
cannabis it dates back you know over

54
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:46,759
6,000 years and pretty much evolved from

55
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:49,740
Central Asia found its way down into

56
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:52,229
India and Afghanistan and Thailand and

57
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:56,250
from those regions spread throughout the

58
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:59,189
world and initially it was land race

59
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,770
based genetics which means population of

60
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:06,359
seeds that come from a specific region

61
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:08,670
that are bred for a particular use by

62
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,640
those people in that region over time

63
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:16,319
and land race genetics had to be

64
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:20,969
incredibly dynamic so it had to be a

65
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:24,259
diverse genome with the dynamic enough

66
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:28,319
dynamism that it could respond to the

67
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:30,780
ever-changing environmental stresses so

68
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,759
those land race genetics that evolved

69
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,219
over hundreds possibly thousands of

70
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:39,329
years eventually spread around the world

71
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:40,979
and they went to Mexico and Africa and

72
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,799
South America and Thailand and

73
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:47,639
everywhere but they were predominantly

74
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:51,030
narrow leaf varieties that had a fairly

75
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:54,479
specific targeted genome because they

76
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,459
were selected as sinsemilla single

77
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,189
plants so essentially a farmer would

78
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:02,219
grow a plant and select the best seeds

79
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:05,280
from those plants and that was the way

80
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:07,979
people selected cannabis for thousands

81
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,379
of years and eventually those seeds got

82
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:13,798
spread out and then after prohibition

83
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:16,319
when the u.s. you know imparted its

84
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,239
grand wisdom on the world and decided

85
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,339
that people shouldn't smoke cannabis or

86
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,479
consume cannabis or use it for a fiber

87
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,149
or for food

88
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,600
those populations became ever more

89
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:31,359
secluded and harder to get to and

90
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,610
eventually they all found their way more

91
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,250
or less to California because California

92
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:39,100
for better or worse is an exceptional

93
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,170
place and the people here fell in love

94
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,170
with cannabis in an exceptional way and

95
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,060
those land race-based genetics those

96
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:50,830
narrow leaf varieties they had a very

97
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:52,930
specific genetic makeup and we could

98
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:55,419
talk about that a little bit more as we

99
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:58,980
go along but they pretty much made up

100
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:03,520
what cannabis was up until the 80s when

101
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:06,340
Prohibition had driven cannabis into the

102
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,279
small grows and small underground

103
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:11,229
gorilla grows out in the in the hills of

104
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,939
California and the hills of Oregon and

105
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:18,520
people needed smaller more compact

106
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:20,620
easier to sell cannabis that could be it

107
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:23,469
could of Eight's law enforcement you

108
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,120
know and could be grown indoors so at

109
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,310
that point it was a critical juncture in

110
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,530
the cannabis genome in that these land

111
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,449
race-based genetics that were from all

112
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,519
over the world and were predominantly

113
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:35,949
narrow leaf got married with this one

114
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,829
very specific population of genetics

115
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:41,529
which was Afghani based genetics and

116
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:44,439
those Afghani based genetics that more

117
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:47,169
or less joined the rest of the world in

118
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:48,939
the 80s kind of came to shape what the

119
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,060
genome the cannabis genome is today

120
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:53,889
because we all had to grow indoors and

121
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,720
in order to grow indoors you need a

122
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:58,979
small plant you need a plant that

123
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,920
finishes relatively early and you need

124
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:04,030
you know something that you can pull off

125
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,040
endorsed and you can't do that with

126
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:07,539
narrow leaf rice the early varieties are

127
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,030
big giant Christmas trees that take a

128
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,370
long time and yield very low so

129
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:15,189
something very specific happened to this

130
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:18,160
cannabis genome in the past 23 years and

131
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:20,500
it was Prine ah'd predominantly driven

132
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,230
by law enforcement and then it was

133
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,870
championed by us by US cannabis breeders

134
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,580
and enthusiasts and then specifically

135
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,490
championed and distributed around the

136
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:31,539
world from the Dutch seed banks and when

137
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,629
the Dutch seed banks

138
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:37,800
the 90s got ahold of these new Afghani

139
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:39,759
knee relief hybrids they were

140
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,930
distributed everywhere and everyone had

141
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,459
the same issue they needed something

142
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,689
that grew fast and then used something

143
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:45,459
that was short and they did something

144
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:47,079
that was potent needed something that

145
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:48,969
they could sell for top dollar because

146
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,490
it was really dangerous and risky to

147
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:54,640
grow cannabis so that is really driven

148
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,019
us to where we are now we're at this

149
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,029
kind of crossroads now we're in

150
00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:01,089
post-prohibition and we're now looking

151
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:04,239
at what is this new cannabis genome that

152
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:07,539
we have now and people are thinking

153
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,530
about well what's the future of cannabis

154
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,110
going to be and what are these

155
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:14,769
selections going to be that that drive

156
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:17,590
the market as the years go by and so

157
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:19,680
we're at a kind of a interesting

158
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:22,119
crossroads where we no longer have the

159
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,470
selective forces that were imposed on us

160
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,780
by prohibition but we now have a very

161
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:31,600
broad palette to work with but at the

162
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:35,079
same time cannabis genome is nowhere

163
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:38,470
near as diverse as it once was because

164
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,879
all those land race based varieties even

165
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,220
though we grot we got some great

166
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:46,120
unicorns from them and we bred with them

167
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:48,750
the populations are gone and when the

168
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,939
population is gone and the people that

169
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:54,310
bred those populations you no longer

170
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:56,620
have the diversity in the gene pool so

171
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,480
now we have amazing plants that came

172
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,910
from those populations but we don't have

173
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,770
the genetic diversity to move the needle

174
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,870
left and right in the way that we once

175
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:08,620
had even though we're way further ahead

176
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:10,870
than ever we're still compromised by

177
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:14,920
that so now the challenge is us as

178
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,660
breeders is to figure out what society

179
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,640
demands from cannabis and what the

180
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,500
industry demands from cannabis and how

181
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:28,089
to achieve that with a somewhat limited

182
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:32,099
gene pool and yeah I think that brings

183
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:34,990
up a really good point in terms of how

184
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,940
there are cultural implications and

185
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,940
cultural pressures and selective

186
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:42,040
pressures that go on in terms of what we

187
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,660
as a community of farmers and

188
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,370
cultivators select for

189
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:48,919
what we're trying to do and that's

190
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,990
culturally dependent you look at the

191
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:53,929
South Asian cultures where it was

192
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:56,089
predominantly selecting for flowers you

193
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:58,729
look at the hashish cultures of Central

194
00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:00,620
Asia and then the hemp cultures that

195
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,470
have also proliferated around the world

196
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,259
and every single culture throughout time

197
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,899
has gotten a hold of this plant and

198
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:12,680
figured out how to adapt it to their own

199
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:16,549
region and to their own purposes and we

200
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:19,609
need to recognize that and most baffling

201
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:20,328
thing it's been both a double edged

202
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,100
sword

203
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:24,888
you know there's positives and negatives

204
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:30,129
about it one here we are now and

205
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:32,539
cannabis has sort of survived the great

206
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:34,639
bottlenecking that we have seen in every

207
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:37,759
other agricultural crop because of

208
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:40,850
prohibition but we've also seen a lot of

209
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:43,879
forces where we had to operate and make

210
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,459
selections and work with populations

211
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,990
over tiny and that brings up something

212
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:52,338
that I think Josh D knows a lot about

213
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:56,180
and that's the proliferation of these a

214
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:58,490
wheat cultivars the OGIS the cams and

215
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:01,099
some of the things that predate those

216
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,709
the Haze's the Northern Lights and the

217
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,110
skunk's these elite cultivars that

218
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:08,629
really a form the basis of our genetics

219
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:12,339
and from I would say the 80s to the

220
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:14,568
present are what we know of as the

221
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:16,519
cannabis genome and what we're all

222
00:10:14,568 --> 00:10:18,860
trying to strive for and do and

223
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:22,339
reproduce we're all chasing out after

224
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:25,970
that next og that next skunk that next

225
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:27,620
nunu and you to somebody who's brought

226
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,920
something into the community kept it

227
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:33,438
going and helped us keep these heirloom

228
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,909
varieties of elite genetics and can you

229
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:39,139
speak to that and how we keep those

230
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:41,899
going I mean I think after all this time

231
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,789
there was at a certain point after like

232
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,669
four years and I was like wow this og

233
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:48,708
cush thing like everybody loves it you

234
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:51,469
know and it's nothing really special

235
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:53,058
that we did you know it was just the

236
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,579
indoor scene was coming ahead and I

237
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:57,558
remember back when I was young if you

238
00:10:55,578 --> 00:10:58,279
had indoor that meant it would smelled

239
00:10:57,558 --> 00:11:00,079
like hay

240
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,360
and nobody wanted it you know that was

241
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,680
second all you got that crap indoor and

242
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,000
it was like how do you have that Mendo

243
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,409
or humble there like some you know

244
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,559
somebody was growing it that had some

245
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:11,809
skills and even with the transportation

246
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:14,989
of smuggling down here you know it still

247
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:17,179
was the very best when I was probably

248
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,590
coming you know a huge cannabis

249
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:21,949
enthusiast at night you know there's a

250
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:24,050
teenager you know and it was interesting

251
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:27,110
because you know all of a sudden this

252
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:29,719
indoor thing happened and OG Kush comes

253
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,430
on the scene and you know I'm I'm

254
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,250
basically lucky enough that it crosses

255
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:37,099
my path right so everybody knows I

256
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:39,049
didn't create this and now that we

257
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,790
discovered recently this year that the

258
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:42,949
guy that did create it did it by

259
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:45,529
accident you know this wasn't something

260
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,080
that he had you know done some sort of

261
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:52,269
like real work on and I think that's

262
00:11:48,080 --> 00:12:00,530
interesting how those things come about

263
00:11:52,269 --> 00:12:03,250
so here we are and I just felt like I

264
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:07,459
started growing OG in 96

265
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:10,909
but in 91 is it sherry yeah

266
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:13,940
91 I think is when we found out that

267
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:20,990
this accidental pollination moment

268
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:26,480
happened and TK and og were created that

269
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:30,799
happened in 96 yeah and so I mean I'm a

270
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,570
huge fan of this one cultivar so it was

271
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:37,399
easy to just focus and stop growing

272
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:38,960
everything else it was really kind of a

273
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,579
spindly plant that doesn't / didn't

274
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,070
produce a lot with the techniques we had

275
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,480
at the time but it was so good that we

276
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,280
were like oh we're gonna figure this out

277
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,320
it doesn't matter you know if he gets

278
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:51,169
half of what we're getting with NL or

279
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,210
whatever else we were growing that was a

280
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:56,419
good move you know and there are a lot

281
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:59,300
of people at some point at some point

282
00:12:56,419 --> 00:13:01,129
that actually left my hands and thank

283
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:03,289
God I gave it to my guy in up in the Bay

284
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:06,889
Area and in is really kind of like the

285
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:08,849
Godfather of good weed in the San

286
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:11,340
Fernando Valley and

287
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,840
for a lot of reasons and nobody knows

288
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,330
who he is he doesn't get any credit it's

289
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,060
very humble but if it wasn't for him

290
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,920
thank God he was holding on to some cuts

291
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:21,739
of that and it was easy as ika and I'm

292
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,449
coming up and grab some cuts you know

293
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,639
but these are strange things because now

294
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,879
I see you know in hindsight I had no

295
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,980
idea that this would become much bigger

296
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,620
than an you know it was like a change

297
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,629
the game this because it became the

298
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,179
genetic backbone almost all the flavors

299
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:41,370
we loved today you know in OG as its

300
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:44,309
found it's like a cornerstone you know

301
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,700
variety that will always probably remain

302
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:49,709
like that but now I see it's the

303
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,810
diversity in cannabis as always attached

304
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,500
to the og when people want to punch like

305
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:56,579
a little kick to my favorite flavor and

306
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,529
you know it's interesting and

307
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,020
fascinating when Mohave says about not

308
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:02,970
having that much of a of a gene pool to

309
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:05,879
choose from to take it to the next level

310
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:09,330
it seems like we really all just jumped

311
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:11,250
in in the last decade or 15 years and

312
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,889
just mixing everything up and now it's

313
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:16,889
hard to pull back unless you have

314
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,569
original stock you know which is hard

315
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,939
now because you have had to have it

316
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,350
stored properly number one that person

317
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,740
still has to be alive and out of prison

318
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,940
you know yeah

319
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,769
but it's cool to think because guys like

320
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,850
Mojave and Rob Clark I know that they

321
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:39,419
have a good stash like we all know that

322
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:42,450
it's true well we we long ago we I I

323
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:46,399
can't speak for Rob but a long ago I was

324
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:48,360
born in Big Sur California in 1969 and

325
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,379
my family had already been in the

326
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:55,289
cannabis industry for a few years and

327
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:58,590
the the the land that we lived on a

328
00:14:55,289 --> 00:15:01,649
place called Plaskett rich and Big Sur

329
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:04,350
it was 1965 few years before I was born

330
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:06,059
that my mother and father invited a

331
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:09,480
friend of theirs to come and stay with

332
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:11,579
us and he ended up we ended up moving

333
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,440
and he stayed there and he became a

334
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,440
grower and his name's Patrick Cassidy

335
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,870
and Patrick Cassidy coined the Big Sur

336
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,820
holy weed and Patrick Cassidy started

337
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:24,370
the first harvest parties

338
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,680
in the new world they recall the

339
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,649
California harvest party and every year

340
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:30,729
a shitload of hippies you can go online

341
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:33,149
you can find a little bit information

342
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:37,060
about this but like a sea of VW buses

343
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:38,799
would descend upon Big Sur and we'd have

344
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:41,019
these big harvest parties I can vaguely

345
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:45,879
remember them up until around 8 years

346
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:49,210
old is when I think they ended and it

347
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,980
was a big pagan cannabis festival at the

348
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,600
end of every at the end of the night

349
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,340
they take the biggest and best plant and

350
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,029
burn it on the bonfire where all the

351
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:00,670
naked people ran around and uh it was it

352
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:04,029
was a real cannabis community and that's

353
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:05,889
what Big Sur and and Mendocino and

354
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,269
Oregon and a lot of these places on the

355
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:11,379
west coast we're doing heavily in the

356
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:12,939
70s and but right around the end of the

357
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:16,659
70s in the early eighties when the

358
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:18,850
Afghani genetics came in and started

359
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:22,329
mixing there was something that happened

360
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:24,340
something something that you could put

361
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:28,540
your finger on which was that everything

362
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:30,940
changed so at that moment the community

363
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:33,639
reacted the community said hey what

364
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,800
happened to our cannabis I mean it was I

365
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,870
mean I can literally remember people

366
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:39,879
saying how come we don't have the weed

367
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:43,629
from last year you know and that was

368
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:45,850
like 1982 1983 and at that moment every

369
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:47,950
that the genome kind of merged between

370
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,110
these two big populations of these

371
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,610
narrowly from these broadleaf plants and

372
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,990
we came up with all the hybrids of today

373
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:57,340
so when I moved to Amsterdam in 1993 and

374
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,159
was fortunate enough to have some

375
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:03,129
old-school California genetics to work

376
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,799
through I was very fortunate to find

377
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:09,309
something that was indicative of those

378
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:11,680
old flavor profiles and those old

379
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:15,309
effects that came with the old-school

380
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,049
landrace based stuff so at that moment I

381
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:21,159
decided that I would spend my life

382
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:23,200
working that line and I've bred that

383
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,970
specific line over and over again and

384
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:29,559
never tried to deviate too much except

385
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,120
after meeting this gentleman over 20

386
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,379
years ago

387
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:38,408
and being introduced to og cush which is

388
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,450
the world's most impactful plant and

389
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:44,500
Josh said something really interesting

390
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:48,009
he said it wasn't a big breeding

391
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,390
experiment that produced og cush we're

392
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:51,009
talking about breeding right and

393
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,600
everyone wants to think about breeding

394
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:55,058
as being this new big industrial

395
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:58,359
commercial thing but it was a couple

396
00:17:55,058 --> 00:18:00,819
beans from an accidental cross that

397
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:02,009
pulled out the most impactful plant that

398
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:07,389
we've ever known

399
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:09,158
so it's luck when when in it's luck in a

400
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,620
vision you know when people know good

401
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:13,240
weed and they can pull good beans out a

402
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:15,729
good weed they come up with amazing

403
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,470
things and that was just a moment in

404
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,929
time and it happened and that's why we

405
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,250
have Logie cush and i just just want to

406
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:23,980
applaud that that it was could have

407
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:27,038
could have not happened easily but it

408
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,990
easily not happened so I crossed my

409
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,548
stuff with og that was the one thing

410
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,019
that I crossed it with and Asha came out

411
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:38,440
Bom yeah exactly

412
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:42,639
it did punch that was the truth and

413
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,860
that's something that we also as we move

414
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,320
into more of a corporate cannabis and

415
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:51,069
when margins and bottom lines make the

416
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:54,519
decision on everything is the next og

417
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:57,158
going to be selected and kept I don't

418
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:58,778
know you know if it doesn't yield and

419
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:01,450
doesn't lunk for the people who are

420
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:03,339
trying to pull weight the og will get

421
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:09,340
pushed to the side but instead because

422
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:11,859
people saw value in something in Florida

423
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:14,648
of all places I mean Florida in the

424
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:17,678
early 90s y'all got the same thing that

425
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:19,839
was yeah what Matt Berger was like man

426
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,730
we got this stuff in Florida it's like

427
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,548
roads it's the best shit you ever spent

428
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,589
I'm like there's no fucking we're like

429
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:27,730
in California bat we have mats from

430
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:31,658
Florida I was like we're in California

431
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:35,019
now man like come on you know I got a

432
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:38,380
mad respect for everybody who I grew up

433
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:41,379
in this shape like I grew up in I was

434
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:44,620
like nerd in commune off the grid

435
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,809
totally backwoods everybody I knew

436
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:48,789
grew weed I was literally growing weed

437
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:51,849
as a homeschooled

438
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:54,159
it's like student as a 16 year old and I

439
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:56,109
was handed marijuana botany and told

440
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,470
here you go kid figure it out

441
00:19:56,109 --> 00:20:01,839
now that right there was some shit where

442
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,808
it was easy and we we went through so

443
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:07,179
many plants we never saved any cuts we

444
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:08,889
were all seed based and we saw gene flow

445
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:12,160
going all over the place

446
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:14,140
but cats back east we're doing some

447
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,180
crazy shit under some serious

448
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,890
prohibition and risk and they were

449
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,990
holding on to some stuff and we all have

450
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:23,620
to be very thankful of all the cats back

451
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:26,349
east the you know the sours the cams

452
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:28,289
the oh jeez you know it all comes back

453
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:32,049
at all genetics come back to California

454
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:33,609
thankfully but we're we're very lucky

455
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:36,639
and blessed for the fact that people

456
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:38,529
made selections not based off of what

457
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,020
was the most heavy yielding what was the

458
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:43,240
most vigorous plant but instead what was

459
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:45,639
the most unique and most desirable plant

460
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,069
and that they then went around and

461
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,080
shared this and saved it and held it in

462
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:52,689
you know people held things closely in

463
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:55,480
their circles and if we didn't have that

464
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,970
cultural dynamic and didn't have our own

465
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,009
culture operating you know with the

466
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,890
prohibition bullshit on the top of it

467
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:06,039
like we wouldn't be where we are now and

468
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:08,170
so thank you to all you have saved

469
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:15,159
collected and persevered through this

470
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:17,769
prohibition bullshit yeah it was um

471
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:22,690
living in Amsterdam in the 90s was an

472
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:25,750
interesting experience in that my my my

473
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:28,420
best friend from childhood owned a seed

474
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:31,720
company Adam Dunn I've known him all my

475
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,519
life and my girlfriend at the time was

476
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,650
the girl who sold seeds at the sensi

477
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,420
seed bank she was the one who took your

478
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,120
ticket at the hash Museum and she's one

479
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,730
of soul-g seeds so I fell into this

480
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:45,428
community where where everyone from

481
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:48,279
around the world would come to open up

482
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:52,179
so all this insular communities in

483
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:54,129
Florida and Arkansas and Indiana and and

484
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:57,130
California they all everyone was

485
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,789
hush-hush and in that hush-hush thing

486
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,940
kept

487
00:21:57,788 --> 00:22:02,499
those gene pools alive as well I mean

488
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,788
that's why we had those plants and

489
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:05,019
that's why we had the diversity back

490
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:06,878
then it's cuz when everyone found a

491
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:09,190
plant that they loved they didn't share

492
00:22:06,878 --> 00:22:10,599
it another group had to find the plant

493
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,580
that they loved another group had to

494
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,168
find the plant that they loved it wasn't

495
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:17,678
just hey let's all share the same plants

496
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:20,409
so in Amsterdam everyone would show up

497
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,940
and share their stories and share their

498
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:26,259
genetics and it was like this kind of

499
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:28,690
open community and that's why you know

500
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:32,128
and then the Dutch seed companies they

501
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:35,379
absorbed those genetics and then in turn

502
00:22:32,128 --> 00:22:37,388
brought them to the world but it was

503
00:22:35,378 --> 00:22:39,488
this fact that for a one there was one

504
00:22:37,388 --> 00:22:41,709
place where these little insular

505
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:44,499
communities could come and share that

506
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:48,308
they were their their their common

507
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:49,929
experience and that was a that was a

508
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:51,308
time that was a unique time and that's

509
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:52,570
when even if you look back you know

510
00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:54,190
those of us who've been doing this for a

511
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:56,858
while if you think back about the

512
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:59,950
cannabis genome in the late 90s in the

513
00:22:56,858 --> 00:23:02,470
early 2000s there was a lot of amazing

514
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,889
plants around a lot of them and they

515
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,690
were all different all of them and some

516
00:23:05,888 --> 00:23:09,819
of them came from little groups that had

517
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,349
no relations to anything else like hey

518
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:13,089
I've been over here in Indiana doing our

519
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:16,298
bubblegum and I've been over here in

520
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:21,158
Florida doing our TK and stuff like that

521
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:23,288
and it was that prohibition dynamic that

522
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:26,109
allowed for that to happen and we don't

523
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:28,538
have that anymore you know now we have

524
00:23:26,108 --> 00:23:30,759
you know we can all just buy clones at a

525
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:32,499
shop so it's once again we're at a

526
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:35,409
really interesting crossroads when we're

527
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:37,749
talking about the the genome about

528
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:42,149
breeding about what people want from the

529
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:47,679
plant and it's we almost have as

530
00:23:42,148 --> 00:23:50,528
breeders a a responsibility to explore

531
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,929
that and then to provide that provide

532
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:55,898
the outcome that facilitates what people

533
00:23:52,929 --> 00:24:02,499
want and it's challenging because we

534
00:23:55,898 --> 00:24:05,878
also have to pay the bills so the

535
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:08,999
driving force now is back appeal

536
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:12,339
initially was what what puts what sells

537
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:19,549
cannabis at a dispensary

538
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:21,230
yeah exactly yeah yes yes we'll take

539
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:21,769
questions at the end I think is what

540
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,529
we'll do

541
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:26,119
yeah thank you very much right but no it

542
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:28,279
is and now well it's interesting that

543
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:30,349
you know bag appeal and smell and flavor

544
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:32,240
and presentation of the flower was what

545
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:35,599
drove the market for a number of years

546
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,970
but now it's brands because now we have

547
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,619
packaged cannabis so we can't look at it

548
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,980
smell it and engage it in the same way

549
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:46,789
but the plants that sold themselves for

550
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:49,220
years became the brand's so now people

551
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:51,409
are have those memories of where what

552
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,029
that plant was so now they don't have to

553
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:56,269
think well what's going to be in this

554
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:58,369
jar you know do the price to enter the

555
00:24:56,269 --> 00:25:01,220
cannabis space right now is you know

556
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:03,829
obnoxious you know so it's like if you

557
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,450
were at an era of time we were everybody

558
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:07,039
was in a band we're all playing music

559
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,360
and the music was rich and everybody got

560
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,420
Ike a chance to come up on stage and

561
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:13,969
play and then it's shifted to well you

562
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,320
can only play if you pay you know and

563
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,990
you can only play for all these other

564
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:20,419
stipulations and all the best hungriest

565
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:23,359
most talented musicians usually can't

566
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:25,759
function that well under such structure

567
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,769
and this is like this is mega structure

568
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,170
right now this is like uber structured

569
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:32,180
very opposite of what we're all about so

570
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:36,519
it's it feels like these two worlds are

571
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:39,830
meeting and you know so the result is

572
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:41,750
the cannabis genome and diversity will

573
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,549
be limited to the only the people that

574
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,710
could enter the space so when you go to

575
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:48,169
a shop all you get is whatever was the

576
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,940
highest seller in BDS analytics and you

577
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:53,090
know you have everybody knows that

578
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,160
bullshit is so you know I can tell you

579
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:57,139
the five top strains and you know

580
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,180
varieties and you'll be like well I hope

581
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,910
than any year from now there's more than

582
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,380
that available but people do follow that

583
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:05,840
way right so to enter this base

584
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,450
expensive most of those guys coming into

585
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,849
this space they don't understand how it

586
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,319
works or the culture you know they and

587
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:14,240
so it becomes a little bit more

588
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,769
difficult to navigate through so they

589
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,750
jump back to hey we'll just follow

590
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:20,180
whatever is popular and then there's too

591
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,250
much of that going on and creates a flat

592
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,200
market and I've seen it in other states

593
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,980
I've been involved with and it takes

594
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,860
time to mature

595
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:30,860
and you hope that guys stick into it and

596
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:33,589
find a way to get through you know the

597
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:35,558
three-year moment and then you can start

598
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:37,819
getting back to your craft again and

599
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:41,298
start focusing on new you know new

600
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:44,839
varieties and ya know that's one thing

601
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:47,450
we're in a major culture clash right now

602
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:48,798
the culture that we come from and the

603
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:52,250
cultural dynamics that we've

604
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:55,220
historically had are totally but up

605
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,869
against some highly capitalized people

606
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:01,579
who don't have a lot of respect for the

607
00:26:56,869 --> 00:27:03,619
culture and so right now the main thing

608
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:06,259
that we're all trying to figure out is

609
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:08,959
how do we who have historically been

610
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:12,500
involved in this and in whatever

611
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,798
capacity we need to figure out how to

612
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,980
link up together and build cultural

613
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:21,769
resilience so that the Josh Dee's of the

614
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:23,870
world the Mojave is and the you know the

615
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:26,750
Trevor wiki's the kids who are just

616
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:28,579
totally backwoods and off the grid how

617
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:30,679
do we all figure out how to get through

618
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:32,808
this because we've got a lot of cultural

619
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:36,288
knowledge and expertise that could get

620
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:40,579
lost and if it's all just about margins

621
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:42,200
and there's no culture there then what's

622
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:44,000
gonna happen like we've seen Budweiser

623
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,880
we've seen that and we've also heard

624
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,569
everybody's saying oh craft is the way

625
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,669
craft will save us but is craft just

626
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:55,099
saying craft and just being like oh I

627
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:57,769
produce quality is that sufficient or do

628
00:27:55,099 --> 00:28:00,829
we have to do more in terms of figuring

629
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:03,319
out how to develop strategies for moving

630
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:06,408
forward in this you know new capitalized

631
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:08,538
world were in well you you mentioned

632
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:11,179
craft which i think is a really

633
00:28:08,538 --> 00:28:14,058
interesting analogy to make us a lot of

634
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:16,610
a couple years ago there were some

635
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:17,658
groups I will not mention names but

636
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:19,428
there are some groups that are going

637
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:20,750
around California saying hey everyone's

638
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:23,960
gonna get to stay in the cannabis

639
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,579
business and it was 50,000 people who

640
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,919
grow and provide cannabis and there's

641
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:30,648
50,000 people who work in the craft beer

642
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,019
and boutique wine industry and there's

643
00:28:30,648 --> 00:28:35,089
room for everyone you know and that was

644
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:35,839
this false sense of security that every

645
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,029
that was

646
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,459
and in order for us to move this

647
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:41,899
industry forward and I understand why

648
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,309
those groups did that because they

649
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,800
wanted to legalize cannabis and God

650
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:48,230
bless them for it but the reality is is

651
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:50,960
there's not room for everybody and craft

652
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:53,240
beer if you want to draw a comparison

653
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,640
it's kind of interesting because after

654
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:59,240
prohibition prohibition wiped out all

655
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,460
craft alcohol completely just decimated

656
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,569
it especially distilleries and small

657
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:09,529
Brewers and it took a long time for

658
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:12,829
craft to re-emerge and the reality is

659
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:14,629
that it reached from one brewery there

660
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:16,730
was one brewery in San Francisco called

661
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,010
Anchor Steam brewery and they were the

662
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:22,130
last man standing they were the last

663
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:25,160
craft beer company that survived

664
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:27,710
prohibition people think craft beer is a

665
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,110
new thing craft beer was how beer was

666
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:33,049
made forever and then came conglomerate

667
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:35,719
alcohol and then it took a long time of

668
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:37,309
a lot of shitty beer for people to say

669
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,100
gee wouldn't it be nice if I could have

670
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:42,559
something that was decent and so Anchor

671
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:45,230
Steam was the one survivor and there was

672
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:49,069
one rich benefactor that the Maytag blue

673
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:50,900
cheese heir who reinvigorated Anchor

674
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:52,939
Steam and then when Anchor Steam got

675
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,100
momentum Sierra Nevada jumped in and

676
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,330
then came Lagunitas and yada yada and

677
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:59,000
then here we are today we're all

678
00:29:56,329 --> 00:30:01,429
drinking craft beer that's great but it

679
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,480
took 60 years or so or 40 years of

680
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:07,960
shitty beer

681
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,559
okay so that's what we're facing we're

682
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:14,740
facing a lot of years of shitty weed to

683
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:16,539
get back to craft you know and if you

684
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,549
look in California specifically where we

685
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:20,109
had a really robust craft cannabis

686
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:22,990
industry they were called grow rooms and

687
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,500
small you know illegal gross they're all

688
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,509
gone

689
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,279
and now we have commercial cannabis and

690
00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:31,029
there's very few people who can produce

691
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:33,730
that level like Josh does on a

692
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:35,769
commercial scale it's very rare and

693
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:38,799
especially when you're exporting that

694
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:42,369
same concept around the world it's kids

695
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,500
even rarer people in Macedonia are not

696
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:45,759
gonna learn how to grow craft cannabis

697
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,119
they're gonna grow learn how to grow

698
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:51,609
commercial cannabis so let's just be

699
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:54,939
cognizant of the way big industry takes

700
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:59,409
over and how long it takes to get back

701
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:01,840
in the door no end for us in California

702
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,810
particularly Northern California that

703
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,759
means Calaveras County we had wineries

704
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:09,549
that operated all the way through

705
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:11,920
prohibition but once legalization of

706
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:14,379
alcohol happened the repeal of

707
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,360
prohibition rather it was impossible for

708
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,990
all those wineries to continue operating

709
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:21,729
because the cost of Licensing we're all

710
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:25,029
experiencing that exact same dynamic now

711
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:29,200
and so for small communities that rely

712
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:31,899
on this we absolutely have to be

713
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,059
cognizant of what the implications are

714
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,850
and if we want to spend the next 40

715
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:39,909
years fighting the good fight to you

716
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:43,139
know have local craft industries that's

717
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:45,730
kind of that's one possibility or

718
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:49,180
another possibility is getting together

719
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:53,680
making local changes politically staying

720
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:56,529
organized and actually making sure that

721
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,720
we can shape this industry and we also

722
00:31:56,529 --> 00:32:00,369
there's a political strategy that has to

723
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,250
be implemented but there's also

724
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:06,519
commercial strategies we have to link up

725
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:10,269
together and figure out how to build the

726
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:14,470
brands build things like Josh D is built

727
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:16,970
like Mojave is built and so when we come

728
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,589
together at these events we need to

729
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:21,409
network we need to meet each other and

730
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:23,839
really look at strategies this is not

731
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:26,120
just about getting together and talking

732
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:28,099
or having people on panels but it's

733
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:30,109
about developing strategies for cultural

734
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:41,389
resilience and moving this community

735
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:42,678
forward so yeah absolutely and and let

736
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,409
me jump in there real quick yeah I think

737
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:47,298
um the the thing is there's a lot of

738
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:49,400
fantastic growers that I know in this

739
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:51,529
state or in the west coast I mean or at

740
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:56,059
least in the areas I've had you know

741
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:58,609
time spending in and I was first of all

742
00:32:56,058 --> 00:33:00,019
I love the diversity I think like during

743
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:02,119
the medical days when you could walk in

744
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:04,158
and there was you know a lot more to

745
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:06,589
choose from as much more hands-on it was

746
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:15,470
like you know it felt like inclusive you

747
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:17,089
know in those days of having just having

748
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:20,120
an opportunity to see all that diversity

749
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:21,589
up in Washington and then during the

750
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:23,479
medical days and when I went to when it

751
00:33:21,589 --> 00:33:25,668
went rec and they had promised the whole

752
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:29,538
entire medical community in the state as

753
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:31,100
part of the reason it got voted in was

754
00:33:29,538 --> 00:33:35,419
because they were not going to touch

755
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:36,769
medical right so luckily I moved up

756
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:39,049
there about five years ago and got to

757
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:42,139
experience what la was like probably 12

758
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:44,538
years you know probably 16 years ago it

759
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,038
was really cool right so then rec comes

760
00:33:44,538 --> 00:33:47,269
in and they bring a couple lobbyists in

761
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:50,859
and they squash it and complete

762
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:52,970
dismantle medical and it became so

763
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:55,548
disconnected from the community

764
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:59,179
absolutely but you were saying something

765
00:33:55,548 --> 00:34:00,710
earlier as well that first of all it

766
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:02,269
doesn't have to be like that like and

767
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,069
I'm here to make sure like I'm gonna do

768
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:07,038
my best so the day I die to make sure

769
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:09,469
that we put out like the best weed we

770
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:11,179
can we hope everybody's happy and wants

771
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:15,199
a you know like to continue to support

772
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:17,510
us you know we've had some bumps in the

773
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,059
road but you know like any new industry

774
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:22,119
this happens we're a start-up the

775
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:24,889
direction starts changing though when

776
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:27,019
the investors want the money faster than

777
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:28,849
it's like humanly possible regulations

778
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:29,659
are you know on you and then it's like

779
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:31,338
how come you don't

780
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:34,068
Gorilla Glue you know that kind of thing

781
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:36,578
and it's like I swear to god we don't

782
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:38,838
want any more Gorilla Glue you know and

783
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:40,639
you know even if it's not OG we

784
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:41,960
diversify and we change and if the

785
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,669
public says you know they want something

786
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,918
different it's nice to go after it but

787
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:47,690
to not be able to and then you get the

788
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,818
handcuffs on you and then people start

789
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:51,619
looking at us as a company like how come

790
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:53,509
you know you're not providing anything

791
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:55,068
special anymore you know you have to

792
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,799
provide something special this is like a

793
00:34:55,068 --> 00:35:00,949
specialty market it's not a commodities

794
00:34:57,798 --> 00:35:02,150
market and you know there's it's not

795
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:04,669
just the people in this room I mean

796
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:07,430
California really like respects and

797
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,588
enjoys fine cannabis fine wine fine

798
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:10,969
music all the best shit you know I mean

799
00:35:09,588 --> 00:35:13,068
we're lucky to be out here in the west

800
00:35:10,969 --> 00:35:15,348
coast and it reflects the rest of the

801
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:16,759
world the whole industry I mean I'm the

802
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:19,250
whole world looks at the California

803
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,619
industry in the market and we dictate

804
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:24,318
the trends here we do a lot of the times

805
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:27,380
and it's like we fold in and don't fight

806
00:35:24,318 --> 00:35:30,500
for genetic diversity and something

807
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,210
special then it really will go away like

808
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,739
a knit and I've seen that happen have

809
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:36,170
you ever been in Colorado it happens

810
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:38,479
there a lot as well like I watched that

811
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:40,099
where the Grouse got so large and then

812
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,079
we go try to find good weed at shops and

813
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:44,119
it's really hard it's really far and few

814
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,289
between and but I think out here we're

815
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:46,608
not at that point we're really at a

816
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:50,569
great point for this discussion to

817
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:53,900
happen so we can go ahead and produce

818
00:35:50,568 --> 00:35:55,909
fine product and brand yourself and with

819
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,130
your merchandise and your marketing to

820
00:35:55,909 --> 00:36:00,558
really staying genuine to what you're

821
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:02,539
about and have a distribution network

822
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,548
where you know you can get your product

823
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:06,559
out there which is what you need to be

824
00:36:04,548 --> 00:36:08,000
successful as well so all these

825
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:09,650
different components that I think people

826
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,969
don't recognize what they are and

827
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:14,298
sometimes I think they sound a little

828
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:16,608
bit more like difficult to achieve and

829
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:18,199
they really need to be like a couple of

830
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:19,608
us guys with a little bit of money like

831
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:21,828
I know for sure we can come up with a

832
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:23,449
distribution plan that makes a lot of

833
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:25,099
sense and speaks to like all the

834
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:26,719
different shops in California right and

835
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,910
the bottleneck right now there isn't a

836
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,189
lot of shops in California there's a lot

837
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:33,639
of cultivation and it's about probably

838
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:36,619
in 12 months from now it's gonna be so

839
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:38,900
saturated with people coming online that

840
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:40,430
they're gonna drop their price and this

841
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,900
is like that whole race to the bottom

842
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:43,399
thing that you hear about people talk

843
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,789
about all the time it's like I can't

844
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,710
sell my

845
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:48,019
product next thing you know it's a

846
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,639
dollar a gram people are flipping for

847
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:51,280
450 a pound and that becomes really

848
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:53,900
difficult to have a business like that

849
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,910
but it doesn't have to be like that and

850
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,039
the problem is is when the weed goes

851
00:36:55,909 --> 00:36:59,809
down to 450 and people are selling

852
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:02,509
ounces for 60 bucks or 80 bucks at a

853
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:05,389
shop the black market kind of goes away

854
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:08,570
and that's where you lose like a lot

855
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:10,909
more diversity you know so it's just

856
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:13,880
there's like a cycle that's gonna happen

857
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:15,529
but I think really there's enough like

858
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,140
talented fun people here that really

859
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,910
believe in this did I put there but like

860
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:22,129
I guess efforts together and their

861
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:24,649
resources you know easy distribution

862
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:27,820
chain merchandising marketing fucking

863
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:31,309
bomb product it can it can work you know

864
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:35,720
yeah on that level we've got people oh

865
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:38,059
geez in every single point in the supply

866
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:40,489
chain and we just need to link up

867
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:43,039
together we have people who are have

868
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:45,559
distributing licenses we have people

869
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,960
with dispensary licenses we have people

870
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:50,960
who have nursery and cultivation

871
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:54,710
licenses and the key is to figure out

872
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,990
how we normalize the supply chain and

873
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:59,240
actually not just normalize how do we

874
00:37:56,989 --> 00:38:00,489
optimize the supply chain so that all of

875
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:02,929
the people who have been historically

876
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:05,299
operating are kind of operating on a

877
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:07,399
premise of like oh you've been

878
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,260
historically operating you've been

879
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,240
producing fire and you come from the

880
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,680
culture so I'm gonna work with you and

881
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:15,469
I'm not gonna work with these fucking

882
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:18,589
chad's that seems like a fucking pretty

883
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:20,209
reasonable like can't we all get down on

884
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,039
that like if you're a distributor and

885
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:23,690
you're like buying from the dude who

886
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:25,340
wears like shorts to here that are

887
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:32,690
pastel colors stop

888
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:35,420
I just don't know it's true his absolute

889
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:37,429
is very good I have to admit though I'm

890
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,789
still not quite sure what a chat is I

891
00:38:37,429 --> 00:38:42,679
know there's a jab he's a

892
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:45,920
it's a hanging Jen that's it right

893
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:47,629
that's it well order yeah no it's true

894
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,240
and I have a corny thing that I like to

895
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:53,000
say sometimes which is you know us oh

896
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:55,339
geez our roots run real deep and like

897
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,320
trees in the wind we have to stand

898
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,960
together if we don't want to get blown

899
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:02,510
over because they will blow us all over

900
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,190
you know the the problem is is that

901
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,720
we're all a bunch of different species

902
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:08,000
of trees you got a redwoods of

903
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:09,379
eucalyptus and Cypress and shit like

904
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,599
that and we're all trying to figure out

905
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,789
how to work together and it's hard it

906
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,369
takes it takes you know what it is is it

907
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:19,219
requires the guy from the outside who

908
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:22,239
understands how to connect us all and it

909
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:24,879
hasn't happened as fluidly as the the

910
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,809
pre-existing guys would have liked but

911
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,420
that's because there wasn't enough

912
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:31,329
business savvy cats involved in the

913
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,440
business yeah you know unfortunately

914
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:35,150
fortunately or accountants and lawyers

915
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,920
and all that shit that we trusted and

916
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:39,410
could work with you know yeah we've got

917
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,090
way too much stovepiping so to speak

918
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:43,250
like we're all in our own little niches

919
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:45,950
and our own little worlds and it's like

920
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:48,769
we got to move away from the lay closed

921
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:51,379
circle and I mean closed circles are

922
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:53,420
good we got to keep our our trust in our

923
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,900
community and stuff together but we also

924
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:58,789
have to have a networked community where

925
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,619
part of it is recognizing people who

926
00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:02,630
have been doing less historically and

927
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:04,429
who are really trying to make the

928
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,130
transition both commercially and

929
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:09,339
otherwise because a lot of this is also

930
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:12,349
about individuals who are out there

931
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:16,250
cultivating and we need to I want to see

932
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:18,619
a like Autobahn Society for cannabis but

933
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:20,659
instead of being like birdwatchers we

934
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:22,519
got people growing their six plants and

935
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:24,710
maintaining that diversity because

936
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:26,960
people who pursue their passion and

937
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,820
plenty of other plant species have this

938
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,760
where like you look at pumpkins or other

939
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:33,920
things people who are backyard breeders

940
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,870
are really doing real work and

941
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,809
preserving the plant and if we build

942
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:41,509
institutions to support that then it

943
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:43,730
will just build more of a culture and in

944
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:47,360
new context for us to develop these

945
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:49,880
sorts of dynamics like apples for

946
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,370
instance are a good example there was at

947
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,460
one point I think they're 7,000 apple

948
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:55,289
cultivars

949
00:40:53,460 --> 00:41:00,869
in in the world and apples were

950
00:40:55,289 --> 00:41:05,009
generally since apples are are not

951
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:06,630
stable they're they're heterozygous crop

952
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:09,150
so you can't just plant an apple seed

953
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:12,210
and get a similar plant as from the

954
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:15,269
parent they were cloned so an apple tree

955
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:17,190
was a family thing a family apple tree

956
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:20,068
so apples were generally named after

957
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:21,809
people's last names so in the US after

958
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:23,190
the Johnny Appleseed era we had

959
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:25,079
thousands of thousands of apple

960
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,990
varieties available all over the country

961
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:30,390
just like cannabis cultivars in the 90s

962
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:32,279
and the early 2000s where there were

963
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:34,650
these little groups and this is my Apple

964
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,660
and then when industrial agricultural

965
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:39,809
happened they said well that doesn't

966
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:42,420
work we can't have 7,000 choices we have

967
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:46,440
to focus what we can sell and what we

968
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:48,690
can market and people want red apples so

969
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,970
you ended up with Red Delicious which

970
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:54,059
dominated the market for decades it's a

971
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:57,118
shitty apple with a bitter skin and very

972
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:59,390
little sugar and crappy acid content you

973
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,309
know what I mean it is the Blue Dream of

974
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:09,779
Apple's oh sorry

975
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:11,519
oh but people loved we had apples but

976
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,079
then came Fugees and Honey Crisp and

977
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:14,849
Braeburn and all these amazing apples

978
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:17,280
that actually taste good and are sweet

979
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:20,730
and have good shelf life and once again

980
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,130
it took decades for it to re-emerge you

981
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:25,230
know industrial agriculture gets a hold

982
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,030
of a crop and they homogenized it and

983
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:29,369
they streamline it and they turn it into

984
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:32,130
a widget that's what industry that's

985
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:34,318
what it does and then people get a hold

986
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:37,530
of it and craft people and people who

987
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:40,619
love heirloom plants and heirloom things

988
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:41,760
and small cool little stuff and then

989
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,920
they turn it into something new and

990
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,720
that's why we now have good apples to

991
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,940
eat but for decades I don't know if

992
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:49,230
y'all if any of you guys are over 40 you

993
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,030
remember you go to the market what you

994
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:53,929
have you had Granny Smith you had Red

995
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:55,650
Delicious you maybe had yellow Delicious

996
00:42:53,929 --> 00:42:57,568
McIntosh if you're in a nice

997
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:00,809
neighborhood I mean that was like a

998
00:42:57,568 --> 00:43:02,730
fancy Apple back in the day yeah but you

999
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:04,890
know so that's where we are and and and

1000
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:07,710
it's a little different a little well I

1001
00:43:04,889 --> 00:43:10,509
mean apples don't get you high right

1002
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:12,369
exactly right well they did in the day

1003
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:13,930
cuz when the Apple diversity it was

1004
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:16,630
actually alcohol that's what spread the

1005
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:18,489
Apple population it was for offers the

1006
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,108
hard cider but it didn't have but there

1007
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:22,539
wasn't diversity in the affect of the

1008
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:24,639
high and that's a big part about Kent

1009
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:27,099
that's a big part about cannabis Jeana

1010
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:29,440
the genome is that it doesn't it's all

1011
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:32,880
different things this every different

1012
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,858
genome provides a different effect so

1013
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,329
it's difficult to navigate that because

1014
00:43:35,858 --> 00:43:39,848
there's no other crop that works that

1015
00:43:37,329 --> 00:43:44,319
way where where they're all different

1016
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:46,170
and we have to pick and I think this

1017
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:49,330
also brings up another point like

1018
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:52,000
clearly elephant in the room doom and

1019
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:54,549
gloom legalization is kind of shitty and

1020
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,369
moving into this new regulated world has

1021
00:43:54,550 --> 00:44:00,789
been a difficult transition for all of

1022
00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:03,250
us and there are large capitalized

1023
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:06,719
douchebags out there that are looking to

1024
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:10,809
try and take over the entire industry

1025
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:13,209
but we're in a situation like I don't

1026
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:15,699
think Apple farmers were in the same

1027
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:18,789
situation or breeders as we are

1028
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:21,189
I don't think corn farmers in the 1980s

1029
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:25,300
are in the same situation that we are

1030
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:27,849
like they were crop commodity producers

1031
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:30,730
they were producing huge amounts of

1032
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:33,460
acreage of land and had tiny tiny

1033
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:35,199
margins and when Monsanto in the 1980s

1034
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:38,769
decided that they were gonna make a move

1035
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:41,108
into making hybridized corn I don't

1036
00:44:38,769 --> 00:44:43,780
think that those farmers were positioned

1037
00:44:41,108 --> 00:44:45,489
the way that we are we're actually aware

1038
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:49,119
of a lot of this stuff we're talking

1039
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:51,338
about this stuff today before all of

1040
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,380
this is happening yes we're in this

1041
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:55,889
transition but federal legalization has

1042
00:44:53,380 --> 00:45:01,210
not happened and so because of this

1043
00:44:55,889 --> 00:45:03,338
there isn't a full monsanto is not 100%

1044
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:05,829
in the cannabis industry they're looking

1045
00:45:03,338 --> 00:45:09,608
at it others like them are looking at it

1046
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:11,440
but we have the opportunity right now to

1047
00:45:09,608 --> 00:45:14,348
figure out how to preserve and protect

1048
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,358
this without having to experience all

1049
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:18,200
the fuckery that we've seen in every

1050
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:23,420
other industry and other

1051
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:26,000
cropping commodity well nobody went to

1052
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:28,460
jail for growing apples are they no no

1053
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,989
but they know I mean not at all exactly

1054
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,269
and there's so the gravity of this

1055
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:33,589
situation in cannabis is a lot heavier

1056
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:35,719
there's a lot heavier absolutely and

1057
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:37,220
apples don't save people's lives you

1058
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:37,699
know in cannabis does save people's

1059
00:45:37,219 --> 00:45:39,589
lives

1060
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:41,689
absolutely it's commoditized I mean yeah

1061
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:44,570
they're apples they're apples exactly

1062
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:47,360
but but the the the comparison is the

1063
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:49,100
clonal varieties hey when we when

1064
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,590
Washington first went legal after the

1065
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:53,089
first year I think there were only seem

1066
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:55,700
like there are only four varieties on

1067
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:59,650
the shelf and I don't remember do you

1068
00:45:55,699 --> 00:46:01,909
guys remember what that was Blue Dream

1069
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:08,329
was it I don't think it was gorillas

1070
00:46:01,909 --> 00:46:10,699
clue but it was just oh man Oh jack see

1071
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:15,099
whether I was like what what just

1072
00:46:10,699 --> 00:46:17,779
happened here man it was like it was a

1073
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:19,250
really awesome pleasant shock to go up

1074
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,830
to Washington after being a grower

1075
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:23,690
don't you know indoors only in LA hydro

1076
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:24,860
the whole time and go up there and see

1077
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,050
the skill set of the people in the

1078
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:28,610
Pacific Northwest you know a lot of

1079
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,110
people let me into there you know grows

1080
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:32,420
and I was fortunate enough to you know

1081
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:35,120
makes those relationships and get to

1082
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:37,070
really see what and to me that was like

1083
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,109
oh sure this is craft cannabis you know

1084
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:40,760
like wow you know and I think Oregon -

1085
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:43,550
it was a lot of skill growers there

1086
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,350
NorCal I was always scared that NorCal

1087
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:49,550
was gonna get the og back in the day I

1088
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:50,659
was like oh shit like hey you can have

1089
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:53,890
the clone but you're not gonna bring it

1090
00:46:50,659 --> 00:46:58,879
to Mendo right you know headbands yeah

1091
00:46:53,889 --> 00:47:02,539

1093
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:06,650
cush they'll tell the story now is the

1094
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:12,200
camera rolling sorry can you turn it off

1095
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:16,730
real sorry Josh gave me OG Kush and I

1096
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:19,029
brought it up to the Bay Area and and I

1097
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:21,949
requested I mentioned I said you know

1098
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:22,700
don't call it cush just call it

1099
00:47:21,949 --> 00:47:25,639
something else

1100
00:47:22,699 --> 00:47:29,029
it was a Sour Diesel crew and they

1101
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:31,400
called it headband and they sold it as

1102
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:32,060
headband and they also sold Sour Diesel

1103
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,180
as head

1104
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:37,429
and they also were growing Sour Diesel

1105
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:39,469
an OG cushion the same grow in Sour

1106
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:41,359
Diesel as we all know puts off nanners

1107
00:47:39,469 --> 00:47:44,299
at the end and pop beans wherein both

1108
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:46,099
flowers so people pulled beans out of

1109
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:51,320
those flowers and call those headbands

1110
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:54,860
so this is a good Philo's bridge go on

1111
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:56,900
Philo's if you dare look look in the

1112
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,900
galaxy and you'll see what is headband

1113
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:03,110
it's either OG Kush or it's Sour Diesel

1114
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:06,849
or it's something else which is a seed

1115
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:08,090
that came off of OG Kush or Sour Diesel

1116
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:10,599
yeah

1117
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:17,360
ask him how he made it to Amsterdam I

1118
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:19,039
have no idea I have no idea but i but i

1119
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,890
but i do remember when Sour Diesel

1120
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:26,539
showed up in Amsterdam very specifically

1121
00:48:21,889 --> 00:48:30,259
and I assisted those guys with setting

1122
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:33,889
up a grow in Amsterdam and it was the

1123
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:36,230
stinkiest weed in town at that time as

1124
00:48:33,889 --> 00:48:39,409
we know there's something about OG Kim

1125
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:42,079
and Sour Diesel there's something in

1126
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:45,339
there that fuelie Turkey thing that is

1127
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:48,259
unique and was a game-changer and I

1128
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:50,660
remember the the nice lady next door was

1129
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:53,510
like I have no problem with cannabis at

1130
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:57,469
all grow as much as you guys want but it

1131
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:59,540
smells so strong I come home it smells

1132
00:48:57,469 --> 00:49:01,519
like weed I go to sleep it smells like

1133
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:04,099
weed my family comes over it smells like

1134
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,420
weed it smells like weed it smells like

1135
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:08,239
home yeah exactly

1136
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:10,039
so yeah that was and that was a really

1137
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:16,009
interesting time because those plants

1138
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:19,099
that Kim triangle Kush OG and Sour

1139
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:21,860
Diesel changed the game in a big way and

1140
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:24,019
from that point on everything had those

1141
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,519
three things in it and it's hard to find

1142
00:49:24,019 --> 00:49:27,860
things that don't have or that aren't

1143

1144
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:33,230
plants in it so we're going to

1145
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:35,710
transition in a couple minutes but I

1146
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,710
want to

1147
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:54,219

1150
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,180
shitty County Calaveras County has a

1151
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:04,849
band right now hopefully that's going to

1152
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:07,129
change in the upcoming months I know

1153
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:09,230
that they're bringing the they're

1154
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:12,860
drafting the ordinance to bring back

1155
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:14,570
regulations now but you know my my

1156
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:21,829
science is all about fucking with

1157
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:24,220
Philo's and trolling my County and III

1158
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:26,420
don't cultivate it I mean I I have a

1159
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:28,939
micro business license here in Los

1160
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:32,119
Angeles but I haven't flowered a plant

1161
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:35,329
in over two years so I've been geeking

1162
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:37,130
out going over my seed library and

1163
00:50:35,329 --> 00:50:40,190
salivating over when I'm gonna be able

1164
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:42,200
to have the time and the space to start

1165
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:48,889
germinating seeds and what could come of

1166
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:51,439
that that's my main geek moment nice man

1167
00:50:48,889 --> 00:50:54,559
you can pop them at our place any time

1168
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:58,700
we hope so I'm currently working on a

1169
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:02,059
facility in Carpinteria Sanibel Santa

1170
00:50:58,699 --> 00:51:04,699
Barbara County maybe some of you've seen

1171
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:07,099
some pictures it's pretty cool it's my

1172
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:09,919
first greenhouse we've worked on you

1173
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:11,679
know as a team and it's exceeding my

1174
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,519
expectations there's a lot of challenges

1175
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:17,929
definitely different growing in a

1176
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:22,070
greenhouse and an indoor it's indoors

1177
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:24,919
you know I miss indoor of course but I'm

1178
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:26,809
blown away like literally and you know

1179
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,820
we're just kind of ramping up to there's

1180
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:30,590
a you know we have like kind of a hot

1181
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,059
rod we've built there but there's a lot

1182
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:34,519
of parts that are super you know need to

1183
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:36,559
be changed so it's always challenging up

1184
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:38,690
there there's a lot of regulations that

1185
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,880
are like kind of trying to keep us down

1186
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:42,769
square footage is an issue there

1187
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,710
everybody knows land use permits it goes

1188
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:47,389
on and on the list so if you see us out

1189
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:49,730
there you know we're doing our best to

1190
00:51:47,389 --> 00:51:53,299
put out you know the very best product

1191
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:53,929
we can we have a lab type seven extract

1192
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,789
lab

1193
00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:58,358
we putting out all kinds of fun stuff

1194
00:51:55,789 --> 00:52:00,529
fav card sauce that kind of thing

1195
00:51:58,358 --> 00:52:02,960
they're gonna probably force us to do

1196
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:04,819
distillate that wasn't my choice so if

1197
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:08,838
anybody sees vape cards out there I am

1198
00:52:04,818 --> 00:52:11,449
NOT a fan of distillate so you know

1199
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:12,858
distillate is just you know everybody

1200
00:52:11,449 --> 00:52:16,719
just stop buying it so we can get back

1201
00:52:12,858 --> 00:52:16,719
to like full spectrum extract you know

1202
00:52:17,889 --> 00:52:22,879
yeah so I mean just getting in places

1203
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:26,300
open and trying to function you know

1204
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,680
trying to create you know a business you

1205
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,789
know with you have to have a lot of

1206
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:31,608
money behind it there's a lot of

1207
00:52:28,789 --> 00:52:34,519
pressure and the actual science behind

1208
00:52:31,608 --> 00:52:36,679
it like the fun stuff is yet to come

1209
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:38,480
but we have a pretty sick lab my

1210
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:42,078
chemists are in the audience right now

1211
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:45,670
and really stoked and excited to start

1212
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,670
you know pulling some turps
