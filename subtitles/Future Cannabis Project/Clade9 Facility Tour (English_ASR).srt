00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:09,980
guys a tour it's very inviting

4
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:15,449
anyway this is the dista cultivation

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,890
entrance that is still building it out

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,710
at the moment so what's this for I'm

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,028
gonna be it'll be the changing room so

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,429
cultivators were walking all right

9
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:26,910
they'll check in yep and they'll come in

10
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:31,349
and change the sanitizer sanitize and

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,759
changing stations will be over here and

12
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,808
then they'll go through that door

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,960
then they'll go through this like the

14
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:42,359
best table for just for cleaning it's

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,410
going to be an air curtain in here so

16
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:48,299
once they walk in they'll go through

17
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:50,819
kind of like sterilization process this

18
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,189
will be air curtain here that'll blow

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:01:00,329
off the any debris they have on them as

20
00:00:53,189 --> 00:01:03,869
they come into the facility so now

21
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,939
you're in so this is it so where will

22
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:07,649
this be blocked off this will be blocked

23
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:09,959
off at some point right now cuz we're

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,368
under construction it's open so the guys

25
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,519
could get back and forth bringing

26
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:18,688
materials or whatever and then this will

27
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:21,478
just be like yeah this is like loading

28
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:24,478
its a loading dock for distribution for

29
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:27,569
supplies will have cultivation supplies

30
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:31,530
here you know packaging post-reduction

31
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:34,169
supplies here and just anything we need

32
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,420
for operations and we have a couple of

33
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,189
other places for storage but all the big

34
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,990
bulky stuff will be here for the most

35
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:45,029
part so you can see we're still in a

36
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:47,280
construction floors haven't been all the

37
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,750
way done yet we have an office here this

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,219
is kind of like our command center at

39
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,629
the mall so is that gonna remain in

40
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:53,399
office or is that gonna be something it

41
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:55,798
will it's gonna remain in office and

42
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,310
this is our break slash conference room

43
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,329
here

44
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,710
I got functioning restrooms thank god

45
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:06,658
we've been using a porta potti for two

46
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:09,598
years so nice change another read a lot

47
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,080
of unsatisfying dumps especially with

48
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:15,109
Cova that was scary scary so

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,640
glad we got through that so once you get

50
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,520
past the hallway here this is where the

51
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,639
cultivation space is and this is the

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,740
core the main corridor for the grow and

53
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:26,659
it's just all flower rooms all the way

54
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,270
down so these are all gonna be flat so

55
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:34,909
this is remember what this is one yep

56
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:38,120
two three four five six and we're

57
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:40,219
actually in the beginning we phased it

58
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,460
out into three phases so phase three

59
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:44,870
this becomes the last flower room but

60
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,080
what we're gonna use it for now is

61
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:51,259
actually trimming packaging storage so

62
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,140
this will be post harvest for now are

63
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:57,829
you in a rush to get every room up and

64
00:02:54,139 --> 00:03:00,829
running or more like let's get two rooms

65
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,500
humming and you know once we have

66
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:06,530
customer demand maybe like room 3 comes

67
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,020
online in room 4 and room yeah it's a

68
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:12,169
great question so we have two up that'll

69
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:15,590
be up by next week and the goal is to

70
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:17,509
get two more on and then kind of test

71
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,150
the market so that's four of seven four

72
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:22,069
out of six the last two though are going

73
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,959
to wait until we get going

74
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,389
I guess because the thing is with all

75
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,640
the infrastructure we've invested the

76
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:30,859
the investment to get additional rooms

77
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,599
up is small compared to the whole

78
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,300
facility so it makes more sense to get

79
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:38,900
as many as you cannot write but yeah

80
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,459
this will be the post production and we

81
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,319
put a you can see there's a little wall

82
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,719
this room is actually about twice the

83
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,090
size so the other side of it is our

84
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,409
water room for the time being so how

85
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,330
many square feet is this room these

86
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:54,370
rooms are 2,000 square feet each flower

87
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,370
room is about 2,000 square get got it

88
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:02,430
so you got the water room here and this

89
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:04,829
will remain the water room

90
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:10,379
this woman yeah at least until we get

91
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:12,770
phase three built out okay so tell me

92
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:16,889
about what's going on in here we have uh

93
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:19,680
so this is it so first of all we're

94
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:23,129
using a price brand of nutrients

95
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,930
clayback right yeah yeah so for those

96
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:28,740
who don't know we have our own nutria

97
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:33,319
line that we've called clade nine since

98
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:37,050
about 2016 and we sell direct to growers

99
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:39,599
mainly to larger scale growers like you

100
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,780
know I would say ten thousand square

101
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,450
feet and up and so yeah of course we use

102
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:47,309
our own product and you know we we live

103
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,839
and die by this by this nutrient blend

104
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,250
and you're gonna break some news right

105
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,519
here right that's right yeah so we're

106
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,560
changing the name of play nine to newts

107
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,899
because later this year we're launching

108
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,509
our clade nine flower brand just so to

109
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:03,750
avoid confusion in the market we had the

110
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:09,569
newts brand for nutrients and clade nine

111
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:12,089
will be the flower bag so what's uh is

112
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:13,680
that like the RO water over there well

113
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:20,969
you know I'll walk you through this this

114
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:23,220
the water room so this it'll our

115
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:29,190
fertigation system is all based on the

116
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:31,460
Prima nutria jet which is over here so

117
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:36,269
this bad boy this is the brain of the

118
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:39,509
fertigation system and it is top of the

119
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:42,689
line Dutch fertigation irrigation

120
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:45,389
control we're about three to four weeks

121
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:46,769
from getting this on line though so in

122
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:48,569
the meanwhile we're just kind of

123
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:52,829
building the irrigation as we go and

124
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:54,149
then is this is this the same prover is

125
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:56,879
just oh yeah that's pretty good it's

126
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:59,519
also I get dosatron type system just

127
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,399
different brands yeah it's similar to

128
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:05,069
the dosatron in that it you know pulls

129
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,489
nutrients and dose ISM but the

130
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:09,990
difference is it has a lot of expandable

131
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,900
capacities so

132
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,509
it'll do lots of monitoring alarming and

133
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:17,879
things that data collection that the

134
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,699
dosatron doesn't do and you are a data

135
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:25,409
guy I'm a data free precision control

136
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:28,669
like say you all know like when a leaf

137
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:31,110
on a plant in room number seven is

138
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:33,689
slightly below temperature that's the

139
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,098
hope at some point yeah well I'm gonna

140
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:36,839
build into that but yeah we'll

141
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:39,149
eventually get to that type of precision

142
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:42,929
yeah but for the fertigation this is

143
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:46,469
essentially what it does is it'll take

144
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,340
the nutrients it'll mix them with our

145
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,410
parameters

146
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,538
it'll fill our day stock tanks which are

147
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,539
behind you and then those will feed the

148
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:57,689
rooms but it'll do all these measuring

149
00:06:54,538 --> 00:07:00,360
it'll measure measure pH and EC here

150
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:02,430
twice and then it'll measure as it

151
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,379
leaves the tanks and there'll be three

152
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,810
points of reference that'll always be

153
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,098
checked and so if there's anything goes

154
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,069
out of whack they'll be alerts and

155
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:13,079
alarms so we'll know the second

156
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:14,819
something weird is happening that's

157
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,829
pretty cool so that's really cool

158
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:19,259
and then and then each room is probably

159
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:21,689
gonna be at a different phase and like

160
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:24,960
one's gonna be just about to harvest

161
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:26,519
one's gonna be yeah six weeks and

162
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,908
they'll be every every couple of weeks

163
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:31,978
so are you having different regimens and

164
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:34,259
yeah so at peak production we'll have

165
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:37,769
six flower rooms and six different

166
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:39,689
cycles at six different times of cycle

167
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:42,269
so yeah the regiment's will all be a

168
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:45,449
little bit different and this thing will

169
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:48,598
be tracking everything from flow rate to

170
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:51,870
the EC to the pH and we can also monitor

171
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:54,149
runoff - so with with each room if we're

172
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:57,538
feeding we're looking at the runoff as

173
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:59,788
well and it's all automated and so if we

174
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:03,810
see anything weird we could have the

175
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:06,329
system alert us and so it's all about

176
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,189
you know having control precision and

177
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:11,399
just knowing when something goes wrong

178
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:14,968
and then what's the is this ro this is

179
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:18,439
ro yoga it's an RO system this is the RO

180
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:18,439
system this is the RO water

181
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:29,010
and then in the in the three tanks over

182
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:31,960
here yeah so with the priva essentially

183
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:34,899
we set the level where we want this to

184
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:36,610
be filled every day and the priva will

185
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:40,120
just keep this thing full to whatever

186
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,288
our level is so if we want 250 gallons

187
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,870
available at all times

188
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:47,080
it'll make sure it keeps it up 250

189
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:49,960
gallons fresh nutrients ready to use for

190
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,600
the room but in terms of your nutrients

191
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,150
what like it is this a different mix

192
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,430
than this then they'll all be different

193
00:08:55,149 --> 00:09:00,100
mixes right so this is flour room 3

194
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:02,769
that's the mother room that'll be flour

195
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,960
room 5 and you notice they're spaces in

196
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:07,029
between those are rooms that aren't up

197
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,330
and running yet so as the rooms coming

198
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:12,610
online we drop in the feed stock tanks

199
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,720
okay so basically where these are in

200
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,509
their life cycle

201
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,670
you're gonna blend something up and then

202
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:20,319
bring it you know take it offline for

203
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:23,500
however long it takes to mix it up

204
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,450
appropriately bring it back online yeah

205
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,629
so right now we're doing by hand yeah so

206
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,790
we have to fill it up mix it it's like

207
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:32,980
flavor you know so in three to four

208
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:34,750
weeks so that'll take over that part of

209
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,269
it so all the mixing will be done

210
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,839
automatically they'll be they'll be

211
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:42,610
filled automatically and with with all

212
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,190
the different controls we could do lots

213
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,289
of really creative types of cycling so I

214
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,980
could tell the Prima that I want to

215
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:52,329
blend the nutrients at 9 a.m. and really

216
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,750
stir the shit out of it so it's really

217
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,820
aerated and then feed at 9:05 you know

218
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,429
and then the next meeting at 9:30 I

219
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:03,580
could have the priva blend it at 9:25

220
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:05,559
so it feeds aerated at 9:30 and just all

221
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,930
of those little things you could control

222
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:11,469
we're going to control to optimize

223
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:13,088
production in addition to the base clay

224
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,779
nutrients are you adding things like

225
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:20,470
microbials or oh no no we have an IPM

226
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:22,449
regiment but we don't add anything in

227
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:27,370
terms of the nutrients it's all our own

228
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:29,740
proprietary blend so here we have the

229
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,080
mom / clone room and then those are

230
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,180
eventually going to be separate

231
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,550
no we're gonna keep this mixed the same

232
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:39,059
we actually use the same formulation for

233
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:40,859
Mom clone and veg actually but we will

234
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:42,929
have a separate bed shank just to have

235
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,940
control just because of the volume

236
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:47,250
requirements a little bit bigger but

237
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:51,210
it's the same blend for Mom clone and

238
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,379
mother's sorry mom cloning bed and the

239
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:58,950
flower rooms are all a little bit

240
00:10:52,379 --> 00:11:01,230
different so and then do you notice the

241
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:04,740
different kind of cultivars you have

242
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:08,190
like different nutrient mixes they do

243
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,500
yeah they're all relatively in the same

244
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,230
ballpark but if you want to dial in

245
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,179
specific varieties definitely I've

246
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,430
noticed it like the sativa hybrids you

247
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:22,199
know what people call sativa is like Jax

248
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:24,239
or anything with turpino lean seems to

249
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,210
have a little bit different requirement

250
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,060
for hydro then say like OG Kush or

251
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,430
something really indica Afghani so what

252
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:33,539
did this achieve as like more or less it

253
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:37,500
seems like they're a little bit more

254
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:38,909
potassium hungry and in the way they

255
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,059
feed throughout the cycle is different

256
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:44,899
to you know sometimes you'll it seems

257
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:47,669
like from our research at like Baba's

258
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:50,490
feed kind of consistently through flour

259
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:52,259
whereas I oh gee cush is like feed super

260
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,220
heavy in the beginning and then it drops

261
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:59,490
off quickly in mid flour and sativas are

262
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,899
kind of somewhere in the middle so yeah

263
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:05,909
we've definitely noticed lots of things

264
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:10,500
about how they feed under construction

265
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:12,600
this will be our drying room okay at

266
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,759
some point and so what are you thinking

267
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,659
of your setup in terms of a drip because

268
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:20,939
do you have any drains like a a

269
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:22,019
temporary drying space right this is our

270
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,280
temporary guys

271
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,829
yeah these actually gonna eventually be

272
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:29,579
flour room six okay flour room six is an

273
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:31,139
LED to level Rd room so what are you

274
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,780
envisioning this setup are you gonna

275
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,210
have like stacks of we're probably gonna

276
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:39,529
go cheap and effective kind of

277
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:42,060
old-school rack systems like the sliding

278
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:43,049
rectangles that hold plants like on

279
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:44,518
trellis nets

280
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:47,490
because it is really cheap and they're

281
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,139
very effective the main the main thing

282
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,389
we're going to invest in is

283
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:53,730
environmental control because that's

284
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:56,610
really where you you need precision here

285
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,899
for you know temperature humidity so

286
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,970
what do you what do you what do you like

287
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,458
to keep it at in terms of humidity and

288
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:06,060
temperature like bring it down yeah I

289
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:08,539
mean we like to keep it cold you know 65

290
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:13,979
or lower in terms of temperature

291
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:16,828
Fahrenheit and then for humidity it's

292
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,300
you know try when the plants first come

293
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:21,000
in there's so much moisture in there

294
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:23,849
you're just trying to like get the

295
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,429
humidity down quick so forty to fifty

296
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,379
and then after you're closer to your

297
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:30,719
moisture level in the flower you can

298
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:33,328
kind of raise it to keep it going a

299
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,160
little longer but I would say early

300
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:37,229
you're trying to bring the humidity a

301
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,569
lot lower and then as the plants dry you

302
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,709
kind of bring it back up right so what

303
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,980
are you eventually like what's your

304
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:47,879
target final human yeah I think you're

305
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:50,190
you're ending up around like 55 60 55 in

306
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:51,269
that ballpark and then the flower is

307
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,420
kind of right there if the right

308
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:57,000
moisture level and do you pretty much

309
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:58,588
dry and cure again getting back to like

310
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,480
different cultivars do you dry

311
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,940
everything the same way or do you have

312
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,100
different um techniques

313
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,459
yeah there's something needed more time

314
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,950
or they do so we give the entire drying

315
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:13,588
cycle enough time for all the range of

316
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:17,850
cultivars so you know some strains might

317
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:20,339
be done in nine some might be ten but

318
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,959
some might be eight so we just make sure

319
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,459
that dry cycle is long enough to

320
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,049
accommodate all the different varieties

321
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,669
so if you have a bunch of different

322
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:28,559
stuff that goes in there at the same

323
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:30,120
time you just leave it so yeah so we

324
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,489
give ourselves two total weeks

325
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,198
okay and then whatever the variance is

326
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,350
and the different varieties they'll all

327
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:40,649
be done by 14 days because one one thing

328
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:42,509
we've seen is the longer if they hang if

329
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:44,549
your if your environment is off

330
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:48,569
especially now that they're doing

331
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:51,778
testing you could fail test for mold for

332
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,360
you know bacteria whatever it is this is

333
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:56,649
where that can really affect you so our

334
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,500
Vegas and data shows are

335
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:02,049
data shows us kind of show pointed us in

336
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,509
the right way to cure dry so you get

337
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:06,278
past it to straight state testing and by

338
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:10,559
Vegas data you mean the data you've

339
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:13,809
gathered from the facility run in Vegas

340
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,698
yeah and also Arizona's to some extent

341
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:17,888
but there isn't any testing still in

342
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:19,859
Arizona so although we have great data

343
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:22,539
from that as well

344
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,820
vaguely you're certainly an expert in

345
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:26,559
drying and curing and super dry climates

346
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,600
oh yeah I know not for sure Ellie's

347
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,448
actually a lot easier right but but

348
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,360
we've we figured it out so we're excited

349
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:36,819
about launching the product you know for

350
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,070
sure alright let's keep going cool so

351
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,000
right space to get through how many

352
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:45,250
square feets the total space 17,000

353
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,970
17,000 and some change from that six bro

354
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,860
rooms at 2,000 each right so five or

355
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:54,070
2001 is that six hundred square foot I

356
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,990
gots prayer mental room so about about

357
00:15:54,070 --> 00:16:00,250
ten thousand six hundred square feet

358
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:04,028
almost 11,000 here's one of the unbuilt

359
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:07,690
flower rooms can we flip this no no

360
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:12,820
never mind no power that's where people

361
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:14,620
get the gist of it and what number of

362
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,720
rooms is gonna be he's number two this

363
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:20,139
room - okay I started yeah that was one

364
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,230
one two three water room or Newton

365
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:26,799
Newton room yep - alright - flour three

366
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:29,740
flour for flour five flour so this one

367
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,099
is the next up and this is five this is

368
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,100
fine

369
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:38,588
so I think we get what kind of lights do

370
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:42,579
we have going on in here it's a mixed

371
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:44,920
bactrim ceramic metal halide HBS 84

372
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:49,208
lights what I what brand

373
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:50,439
these are growers choice okay and I

374
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:53,619
assume you've done a whole lot of

375
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,870
lighting research to come to this so how

376
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,789
many so this is a 2,000 square foot room

377
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,740
right this is a little bigger actually

378
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:01,389
this one's about 2200 and how many

379
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:10,599
lights 84 lines

380
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:13,390
84 and so what do you like about the

381
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:17,948
metal halide it gives it some blue

382
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:20,049
spectrum the HPS does it have so we just

383
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:21,750
this is really our second production

384
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:24,189
room we've done the mix spectrum and

385
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:27,039
I've experimented with mixed spectrum in

386
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:28,900
the past but way back in the day it's

387
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,418
just the fact that the fixture cost

388
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:34,690
between the ceramic metal halide nature

389
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:36,580
gets are so close we decided hey we

390
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,110
might as well blend them and just give

391
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:40,539
us control so we have two different

392
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:43,389
controllers and we could control the

393
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:46,539
spectrum on four different bands of

394
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:52,570
controllers within the room so out of 84

395
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:56,168
we could do 21 HBS and you know our 40

396
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:58,058
42 HBS at 50% ceramic metal halides at

397
00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:01,720
100 and just really play with the

398
00:17:58,058 --> 00:18:04,829
different blends of Blues with the Reds

399
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:08,610
at the HBS have the far Reds of the HBS

400
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:11,109
and and dial in and out of different

401
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:13,389
yeah yeah we could turn the HBS

402
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:15,759
completely off have the CMH all the way

403
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:22,540
on or we can do the opposite have all

404
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:24,460
HBS with no CMH and we kind of over we

405
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:26,769
over respect the room so we have more

406
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,169
intensity so we could kind of go up on

407
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:31,000
one or the other just it gives us more

408
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:34,270
playing yeah what what do you have like

409
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,500
targets for DLI and yeah I mean the DL

410
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:41,379
ID numbers indoor it's a lot lower than

411
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:46,089
like green house I want to say our DLI

412
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:48,220
for indoor is like 30 you know I got to

413
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:52,389
do the math but we run about 700 micro

414
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:55,120
moles maybe 800 max during flower and

415
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,500
only for a limited amount of time so I

416
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,629
have to do the calculation that's it I

417
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,450
think the deal I was around 30 but I

418
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:06,179
have to sit down and do some math but

419
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:09,940
our DLI changes through flower so but

420
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:11,590
yeah looks it's we're really close this

421
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,509
room is supposed to be ready within a

422
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:16,599
week and a half so looks like we're

423
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:17,919
we're really close but I'm up I'll show

424
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,269
you the flower when we actually have

425
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,210
this running with the same configuration

426
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:24,490
next door so check it out let's do it

427
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:28,390
well so we got to go around we got to go

428
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:29,319
around we go get scrubbed up now you

429
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,049
must be psyched

430
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:33,939
oh yeah psyched and stressed it's all

431
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:36,548
kind of combined spent a long journey

432
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,830
yeah alright so this is the official

433
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:40,450
cultivation entrance over here and and

434
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:42,069
this will be the official entrance

435
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,289
because I thought that's oh yeah sorry

436
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:46,089
sorry it's the official right now but

437
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:48,808
yeah this is temporary cultivation

438
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:52,509
entrance right and this will switch to

439
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:55,048
just like an emergency entrance and exit

440
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:55,048
at some point

441
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:13,990
so we'd have a mini changing room over

442
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:21,190
here

443
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:23,319
not to get scrubbed up here so you have

444
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,808
the same protocols going now same

445
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:29,678
protocol is just a smaller room for a

446
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:32,558
smaller crew so everyone comes in you

447
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:39,220
got to put some coveralls on some large

448
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:40,329
pants for you right pants and sure and

449
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,720
I'll be right back I got to grab my

450
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:47,019
units over here yeah so should I put

451
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,360
these stylish oh you know what I don't

452
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:53,379
know if we have any extras ooh one sec

453
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:54,699
oh you know we do what they are Crocs

454
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,650
yeah I gotta be come through what I was

455
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,700
gonna say that these stylish-looking

456
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:02,380
mario batali uh everyone makes fun of

457
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,769
you at the crocs but see what come

458
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:08,530
through ball set as other yeah I feel

459
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:12,579
like I look like a ninja

460
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:16,539
yeah if a ninja made love to and orderly

461
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:18,189
and had a baby that's right it would

462
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:23,230
look like this so I'd actually be a good

463
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:24,940
cultivator brother Lee this is the

464
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,039
cultivation entrance and we show you

465
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,058
kind of the protocol so we have a bio

466
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,730
safe mat here

467
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:35,889
yeah and yeah sanity in it so you step

468
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:44,110
on it and what is it like bleach or what

469
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:45,640
I jump rope era scenic acid so it kills

470
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:48,069
anything on your feet we also have

471
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,830
facility shoes as you're wearing so it

472
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:52,450
just really like overkill but we want to

473
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:55,058
make sure anything that's in that room

474
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,880
gets killed coming into the closest

475
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:59,649
close the door yeah and then after you

476
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:04,540
step into the facility you could put on

477
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:08,070
the booties oh not only the stylish

478
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:11,309
Crocs but the booty is that go on top

479
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:15,720
yeah all right so this is the whole

480
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:18,269
setup as modeled by Dave that's right

481
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,900
yeah so there's a temporary cultivation

482
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:24,389
entrance and see we have dis afraid er

483
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,800
the whiteboard so when the guys come in

484
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:30,150
all right so today is what day this is

485
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,829
June 29th okay

486
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,360
and so we usually leave a list of kind

487
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:38,159
of things for the guys to do things to

488
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:42,750
knock out so we have just our straight

489
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:46,519
and rollin benches mother so mother

490
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:50,690
rooms 77 degrees was 68 percent humidity

491
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:54,930
yeah these are sex you know clones so

492
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:58,650
78-75 all right and then the supply as

493
00:22:54,930 --> 00:23:01,289
the as the boss but the entrepreneur you

494
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:04,230
just came back from staples and that's

495
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:07,619
right at Home Depot you get the paper

496
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:09,569
towels and yeah you're doing it all yeah

497
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:11,879
you know however the guys focus on

498
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:13,559
cultivation and just trying to be

499
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,660
scrappy and running around and do what I

500
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,990
could do at the moment some part of

501
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:21,810
entrepreneur part cultivator part HR

502
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,819
taken trash you know yeah whatever

503
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:26,909
whatever I need to do to get it done at

504
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:30,450
this point but yeah this is just kind of

505
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:33,570
our little mini kind of meeting space

506
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:36,330
and the guys get started here and then

507
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:39,000
go throughout the day we just this kind

508
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:40,710
of exciting we got a breeder of the

509
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,160
breeders brief in the cannabis business

510
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:47,190
times that's coming out I think this

511
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,400
week so our snake eye strain which is

512
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,809
one of our proprietary varieties which

513
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,000
have been very successful in other

514
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:56,789
markets and it's actually developed here

515
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,309
in LA in the Arts District so it's kind

516
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:00,599
of exciting to bring it back and we're

517
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:02,519
gonna launch that here and we're about

518
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,409
just see it right what's that we're

519
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:07,529
about to see it it's a little early in

520
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:09,090
flower but well yeah in the mom Ritz and

521
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,289
the mom room we have it in the mom room

522
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:11,699
we have it in the flower room see ya

523
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:14,089
ought to go see it let's go see them

524
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,090
I'll check

525
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:21,110
so here is our mom room / bedroom

526
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:31,590
alright so in here you have you want to

527
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:34,379
talk about the setup like that you're

528
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:39,480
all Dutch right this is all yeah these

529
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:44,580
are rolling benches and we're running on

530
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:49,710
drip irrigation so because it's a

531
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:51,689
temporary setup for veg we are just hand

532
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,819
watering Wow

533
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,490
okay which is a little bit

534
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:58,470
labor-intensive but until we get the veg

535
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,170
room up until we get our fertigation up

536
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:04,140
we're just doing we got to do so we're

537
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:06,509
in here watering every day and just

538
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,880
making sure that the moisture rate in

539
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:12,619
the cubes the pH the EC is all on point

540
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:16,230
and so far everything looks really good

541
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:18,089
so you have ghost well yeah so we have

542
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:24,000
ghost OG and actually there should be

543
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:26,819
let me see if there is a long list vo

544
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,170
its we got ghost OG and these are split

545
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:33,470
a little bit so you could walk on down

546
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:37,440
the aisle and we split up the strains

547
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:39,990
yeah with the painters two little

548
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,460
painters tape painters tape you can

549
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:44,700
imagine how much you go through and they

550
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,529
grow it's like for separating tables for

551
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,819
labeling your clones and I use

552
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:51,269
everything it's like it's a great

553
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:54,359
product gap - yeah so these are classic

554
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:58,379
OG varieties this is a ghost OG this is

555
00:25:54,359 --> 00:26:02,219
Private Reserve OG this is this is a

556
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,840
Bubba Skye which is a pre 98 Bubba pad

557
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,720
in the collection for more than a decade

558
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,909
by the way and it's just probably the

559
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:14,279
best bubble I've ever ever smoked ever

560
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:17,160
seen so we've kept it forever and then

561
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:20,369
after the Bubba you got the j1 the you

562
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:22,220
know trusty Jack arrest gun cross so

563
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:25,649
great yield er it's a really phenomenal

564
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:28,450
sativa high inter pinna lean but just a

565
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:31,590
great grower easy to grow

566
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:38,350
yielding but also this is a great flower

567
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:40,179
and then as we go down we have this is

568
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:44,189
an experimental strain we're really

569
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:48,009
excited about here this is the MLG six

570
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:55,330
which is really a cross between my

571
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:59,920
Phoenix og Girl Scout cookies ghost og

572
00:26:55,329 --> 00:27:02,619
and Emerald triangle crush so it's a

573
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,950
month what they call this in Cali is in

574
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:11,769
exotic it's an exotic you know but it's

575
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:14,860
super super phenomenal quality really

576
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:18,039
really Brockie kind of compact super

577
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:20,799
resinous super pretty great bag appeal

578
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:23,319
and just like great great great trip

579
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,450
profile as well it's super tasty has a

580
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:28,029
little bit of a gassy from the OG and

581
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:30,940
from the Phoenix but it has a really

582
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:33,190
nice color in structure more from the

583
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,740
Girl Scout cookie so just a phenomenal

584
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:40,259
hybrid but we're gonna run this one in

585
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:43,440
production finally on our third room

586
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:46,930
then we got a little bit more Tahoe here

587
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,840
there's another og we love og so we have

588
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:51,610
the original Tahoe cut Tahoe the ghost

589
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,369
the Private Reserve those are Auto G's

590
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:58,740
in production here and then after that

591
00:27:54,369 --> 00:28:02,919
this is snake eyes and that's the house

592
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,240
cultivar this is a house cultivar this

593
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,820
one has been great for us we've won

594
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:11,109
several awards in Arizona on the flower

595
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:12,669
on the extract we've ran it in Vegas as

596
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:15,039
well and people love it it's just a

597
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:20,200
really small yield er you know it's only

598
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:22,000
drawback to snake eyes have you been

599
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,670
playing around with crossing with other

600
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,559
things - oh yeah yeah so I have like a

601
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:31,330
massive collection I have about 200

602
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:37,179
lines under my belt of hybrids

603
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:41,319
you know just F one's inbred lines you

604
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:42,289
know back crosses but yeah approaching

605
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:45,619
200 lines

606
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:47,480
over ten years of breeding and this is

607
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:49,250
this is one of the great ones this

608
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,039
diamond dust which is the next one is

609
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,930
probably our most well known in we run

610
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:59,569
this in Vegas

611
00:28:53,930 --> 00:29:04,759
and it's our best seller and the diamond

612
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:10,250
dust is a hybrid of double dream sour

613
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:13,490
bubble Lemon Haze and bubble gum but

614
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:15,529
what's interesting about it it has it

615
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:17,930
leans towards a no cheater profile

616
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:20,839
without having any og lineage and that

617
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:22,340
was one of the reasons I that was part

618
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:24,889
of the goal in that line and I'm still

619
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:27,649
working on this line it's too long you

620
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:30,800
know years in progress but the goal is

621
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:34,370
to create a beautiful OG tur profile

622
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,690
with no og lineage and so you're

623
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:37,939
creating a much more vigorous strength

624
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:40,700
zo G's are really finicky strains that

625
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:43,610
have been bred endure forever in bred so

626
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,470
they're just like they're they're

627
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:47,959
they're great product but it is tough to

628
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,059
grow so this diamond dust the goal is to

629
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,950
make something that has that profile but

630
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:55,309
it's just really vigorous to grow easier

631
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:56,710
to grow and this is kind of like part of

632
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:59,480
that project

633
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:02,559
so that's diamond dust and over here we

634
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,559
got some some other stuff

635
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:16,278
we more diamond dust the beginning of

636
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:16,278
this rose diamond dust diamond dust here

637
00:30:18,138 --> 00:30:25,589
and then stopping here this is G 13

638
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:29,249
that's 15 13 but it's actually it's not

639
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:31,769
the real G 13 it's a a new take G 13 2.0

640
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:33,929
we'll call it but the reason I I'm

641
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:35,759
taking the liberty of calling it G 13

642
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:37,679
because the bubblegum male that I

643
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,230
started this line with came from L Frank

644
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,330
and Mel Franklin you he work with the

645
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:44,368
University of Mississippi so I thought

646
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:46,558
you know what we can call this G 3rd 13

647
00:30:44,368 --> 00:30:48,269
and get away with it because we work

648
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,819
with Mel on the bubblegum

649
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:54,990
but yeah this is the G 13 that that row

650
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:58,200
is also G 13 G 13 is just like a super

651
00:30:54,990 --> 00:31:03,538
potent kind of like you know heavy hair

652
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:06,889
I remember in the late 90s coming across

653
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:10,470
that and in Rhode Island and oh yeah

654
00:31:06,888 --> 00:31:12,479
yeah that was some powerful stuff yeah

655
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:15,298
yeah so we're trying to bring the g13

656
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,269
back but I giving out our own twist but

657
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:21,538
it's a really nice strain I mean it's a

658
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:24,359
very well well-loved in Vegas we grow a

659
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:25,769
lot of it in Vegas so we know that you

660
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,319
know the Cali market will like it as

661
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:30,359
well and and that's about it for the

662
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,249
varieties in here and then what's going

663
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,099
on yes that's G 13 that's where I got

664
00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:38,819
all the whole that's all g13 this is all

665
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:42,740
that's all G and so how many how many

666
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:48,990
plants are in each Bay we have let's see

667
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:53,730
five tables here it's about 250 per

668
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:54,990
table approximately in here and that's

669
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,019
because we're doing our bigger room

670
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,190
usually it only be about 200 but because

671
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:01,980
we're doing our bigger room it's about

672
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:05,999
250 per table and so what's the

673
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:08,669
breakdown of cultivars you're growing

674
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:10,470
that you love and cultivars you're

675
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:12,720
growing that you're like I like it but

676
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:18,450
the market fucking loves it yeah that's

677
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:20,250
a great question I'm I'm kind of in line

678
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:24,870
with the market in many ways you know

679
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:26,279
I would say 20% of what we grow is stuff

680
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:29,309
that I wouldn't necessarily personally

681
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:31,259
want to eat to smoke like I'm not a huge

682
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:33,450
sativa fan you know like I would I

683
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:37,289
wouldn't smoke jy probably and we run

684
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:41,400
you know quite a bit of j1 I'm a big og

685
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:43,049
fan I like I like perks so those are the

686
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,970
strains you know we kind of gravitate

687
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:47,159
towards partly because the market just

688
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:49,079
loves them I mean I might be biased to

689
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,820
grow a little more of it as well and

690
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:53,549
what's something you personally love

691
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:58,409
that's not in the lineup right now oh

692
00:32:53,549 --> 00:33:00,149
that's a great question Ben dope ERPs I

693
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,220
love men dope Earp's

694
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:04,110
it's one of my favorite all-time strains

695
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:08,460
but we don't run it you know that

696
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:11,099
unfortunately California is still is as

697
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,970
much experience California has in

698
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:17,250
cannabis the REC market is really

699
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:19,440
immature you know and so a stream like

700
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,660
Mentos perps which has a great taste and

701
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,320
just a great effect it's a great plant

702
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,230
to grow

703
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:28,259
it just doesn't has a low THC count you

704
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:31,049
know it's like 16 to 18 and the market

705
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:33,990
just isn't super receptive to it but I

706
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:35,819
want to bring back like a Mendo perp you

707
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:38,039
know like a true men doper like people

708
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:40,019
love purple punch you know but it's the

709
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:42,899
same kind of thing everyone runs it so I

710
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:45,869
am kind of working on a perp hybrid in

711
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:48,750
the background that I want to bring into

712
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:50,699
production at some point and then with

713
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,369
the mom's kind of what's your strategy

714
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,059
in terms of like how long you keep each

715
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:59,609
one how many clippings you can get off

716
00:33:56,059 --> 00:34:02,789
when you basically yank them yeah we

717
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:05,669
that we like to recycle them relatively

718
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:09,779
quickly like three to four months you

719
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:13,139
know and then you know getting every

720
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:15,929
time we take cuttings off it 30 to 40

721
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:18,510
really good cuttings per mom so this

722
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:23,820
room eventually won't have any veg patch

723
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:25,679
it'll be about 150 to 200 mom's and you

724
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,309
know we'll take maybe half of those moms

725
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,079
will take 20 clones of each one every

726
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:33,269
couple of weeks and they'll cycle back

727
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:36,719
and forth and so what how many and

728
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:39,599
our vegging right now versus moms yeah

729
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:42,959
they're all vegging and our moms are

730
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,699
gonna be the select few chosen plants of

731
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,679
each variety got it got it guys so we'll

732
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,969
take you know like our top eight of each

733
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:55,168
variety and those will become our

734
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:58,908
mothers got it all right let's go check

735
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:58,908
out the clone the clone room next door

736
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:10,710
so this is the Cologne room pretty empty

737
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:12,299
right now but we're taking clones on

738
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:19,800
Friday so this will be filled again

739
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:22,230
Friday evening and what's your kind of

740
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,720
method like you take the clippings are

741
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:27,449
you dunking them in anything are you

742
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:31,250
pretty standard standard propagation

743
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:33,750
with domes we're taking our clones and

744
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:38,179
dipping them in a rooting hormone and

745
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:38,179
then sticking them in a 1.5 inch block

746
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:55,640
and over here we have some experimental

747
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:56,779
these are kind of the fun stuff here so

748
00:35:55,639 --> 00:36:00,159
what are we looking at

749
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:03,620
so all of these well there's about uh

750
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:05,710
maybe half a dozen new varieties that

751
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:08,269
came from lines I've been working on

752
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:11,240
that were just getting to the test phase

753
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:13,610
where we've ran them once we like what

754
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:15,409
they had to offer whether it was you

755
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:17,300
know the subjective or objective testing

756
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:18,529
and now we're gonna put them in a

757
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,650
production room and see how they perform

758
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:23,269
on a smaller scale and then we'll get

759
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:25,880
flour from those and then if we like

760
00:36:23,269 --> 00:36:27,769
that flour and we really think it has a

761
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,990
chance of getting production then it

762
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:33,199
will go in production in the next cycle

763
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:36,679
of the cycle after but we have these are

764
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:41,119
the diamond dust f2s our top four

765
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:43,669
varieties so far we have some more of

766
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,250
that MLG variety there's five fie knows

767
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:53,000
that we really like in the MLG this is

768
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:56,900
the 17 this is an F 2 of our sei 40 the

769
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,139
Dona OG is a strain that we we've we've

770
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:03,530
ran for years and then to some other

771
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:06,940
random stuff we have purple dream

772
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:09,790
Emerald triangle more diamond dust f2s

773
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,809
we have some some kind of classic

774
00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:16,519
strains that are in the market like the

775
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:21,369
mimosa at the gelato 33 the piti 28 is a

776
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:23,960
pre 98 baba ghost OG over here sorry

777
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:26,650
yeah this is all the experimental stuff

778
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,650
essentially

779
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:34,609
and then you have uh-oh yeah we have

780
00:37:33,978 --> 00:37:36,998
more over here

781
00:37:34,608 --> 00:37:41,748
yeah these are yeah this is kind of some

782
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:44,058
off the mop you know standard dark heart

783
00:37:41,748 --> 00:37:51,078
purple city kind of genetics that we're

784
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:54,440
running as well and then what's the the

785
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:56,209
humidity in here we keep the the clone

786
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,979
room pretty humid we try to stay like at

787
00:37:56,208 --> 00:38:02,929
70% just so when we're doing acclimation

788
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:05,689
dome removal the clones don't have any

789
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:07,578
transition stress so you use Don's we

790
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,469
use domes yeah yeah no we're just

791
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:13,459
cleaning and getting ready for the next

792
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:16,309
production cycle so and we'll show you

793
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:18,108
in the flower room and then the art is

794
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:20,380
everything and here gonna be on

795
00:38:18,108 --> 00:38:25,009
automated irrigation too

796
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:27,170
so for the clone room we have a tank in

797
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:29,659
the in the water room that feeds in here

798
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:31,700
so the guys will have like a hose it

799
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:33,798
just irrigates whatever they need you

800
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:36,228
don't really need a lot of water here we

801
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:38,509
rarely need more than five gallons at a

802
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:40,489
time right so the tank will be mixed

803
00:38:38,509 --> 00:38:42,318
automatically whenever they need water

804
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:44,028
they just fill up a 5-gallon bucket and

805
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:46,088
they can have water yeah we're going to

806
00:38:44,028 --> 00:38:48,920
be experimenting with some type of like

807
00:38:46,088 --> 00:38:51,978
misting system so we could reduce labor

808
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:55,818
in here but that's you know later next

809
00:38:51,978 --> 00:38:58,189
year so clone room and then we have

810
00:38:55,818 --> 00:39:01,429
flour for this is not up and running yet

811
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:02,989
what is using it as like a storage this

812
00:39:01,429 --> 00:39:08,058
is going to be probably the next room

813
00:39:02,989 --> 00:39:09,679
that we flip after flour room five so

814
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:12,109
it's kind of getting ready so this is

815
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:13,489
the next build-out after five yeah so we

816
00:39:12,108 --> 00:39:15,949
have everything all the infrastructure

817
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:22,659
is ready we see lighting and we need a

818
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:22,659
track I mean only a tracking ID

819
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:31,650
this is the bedroom this is another room

820
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:37,429
that's closer that we have to build out

821
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:37,430
still - it's gonna be a two-level LED oh

822
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:43,619
you're gonna see you're gonna put

823
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:47,759
shelving in we will yeah

824
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:51,599
and what brand um not sure yet probably

825
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:54,870
the PIP horticultural Rex okay I have

826
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,929
like three thousand pounds of burrows in

827
00:39:54,869 --> 00:40:01,109
my oh the purpose right way yeah what

828
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:06,049
you don't like the Burrow xored why it's

829
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:09,329
my house Wow so basically they sent me a

830
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:10,380
shelving for my garage so I could like

831
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:13,349
play with it

832
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:16,710
and it showed up and it's 12-foot

833
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:18,360
shelving and I was just like this won't

834
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,550
even fit in my garage and I was always

835
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,340
gonna bring it to the nursery I was

836
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:26,220
working at in Carpinteria but then we

837
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,960
needed like an f-150 to load it all and

838
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:30,899
every time we were trying to coordinate

839
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,019
getting the truck down like anyway it's

840
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,059
still in my driveway so if you need

841
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:37,500
burrows all hit you up yeah yeah yeah

842
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:39,570
burrows is actually looked at burrows

843
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,909
too but we end up we're thinking about

844
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:44,240
going pit probably so here's our flower

845
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:44,239
room

846
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:52,489
yes so so basically every other light is

847
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:57,110
HPS ceramic metal halite yeah

848
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:06,340
all right

849
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:06,340
okay so we have a wine

850
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:18,820
and this is day 17 of flower and this is

851
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:21,539
our metric tracking are you enjoying are

852
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:24,539
you loving metric well you know we had

853
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:27,219
luckily some experience in Nevada so

854
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:30,159
we'll use two metric and we've been

855
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:32,079
using it for a couple of years there are

856
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,869
some little changes between the states

857
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,549
but for the boat year though the water

858
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:38,799
is coming out here and then it's just

859
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:42,660
running down this that's right good

860
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,660
steak drip irrigation

861
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,780
this is a snake eyes

862
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:07,139
and so how many more weeks do these have

863
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,780
eight eight more weeks yeah

864
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:11,670
so we go really full-term look compared

865
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,740
to a lot of growers but some growers

866
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:17,309
grow ate a lot of girls go nine we go

867
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:20,119
ten just to push the trichrome

868
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:22,949
production to push the chirping levels

869
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:25,199
and then just a chlorophyll reduction as

870
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:27,569
well you know when you go ten weeks you

871
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:30,210
get a big drop-off in chlorophyll even

872
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:31,920
though it's still growing so when you

873
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:35,400
harvest you're closer to where you need

874
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,130
to be well you know Matt do you have

875
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,260
different for us so you even though you

876
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:42,539
have different varietals in here your

877
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,570
flowering them all for the same number

878
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:49,400
of weeks that's right yeah yeah this

879
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:51,450
logistically it's easier at this point

880
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,039
but it gives us a little bit of

881
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:55,199
flexibility it's even though we go ten

882
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,639
weeks you know at nine and a half weeks

883
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:00,329
we could start to harvest different

884
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:03,139
varieties or if we want to do fresh

885
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:05,849
frozen will harvest a row at nine weeks

886
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:07,710
now are you gonna do you sure you're

887
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:11,130
gonna do fresh frozen then hand it off

888
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:13,199
to a partner yeah we've done that in

889
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:16,019
Nevada you know I don't know if we're

890
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:19,139
gonna do that yet but it's an option

891
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:20,880
it's always a nice option and then is

892
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:25,259
that going to be like in Nevada were you

893
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:28,650
doing it for like solvent list hash or

894
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:31,560
for you know a turbine it was more for

895
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:34,500
hydro carving I got in Nevada I would

896
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:37,949
prefer to do a solvent less extract you

897
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:40,550
know like a fresh fresh frozen like live

898
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:44,189
rosin that would be something I would

899
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:46,550
much rather do so but yeah that's

900
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:48,780
something we're working out right now

901
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:51,269
but for in the beginning it's going to

902
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:53,220
be flower focus and then we'll kind of

903
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:55,250
transition into more extracts if we need

904
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:55,250
to

905
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:09,589
that's the money shot it's the money

906
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:12,509
shot for sure

907
00:44:09,588 --> 00:44:15,449
so do you spray this stuff with any

908
00:44:12,509 --> 00:44:17,938
Polar's or not at all we do folios we do

909
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:20,999
like phosphorous Foley or nitrogen

910
00:44:17,938 --> 00:44:23,548
foliar and we do do like zero tall a

911
00:44:20,998 --> 00:44:28,198
little bit which is hydrogen peroxide

912
00:44:23,548 --> 00:44:32,369
and the peracetic acid but not late just

913
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:36,088
really early on in Flour works we're

914
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:38,400
experimenting with like regalia and a

915
00:44:36,088 --> 00:44:39,239
couple around right what's up that's

916
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,139
Moran

917
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:45,869
Marone yeah right Marone so what kind of

918
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:47,879
pest does one see in in like an LA

919
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:50,729
indoor grow oh my god

920
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,769
hopefully zero but over the years I mean

921
00:44:50,728 --> 00:44:56,698
everything under the Sun you know we've

922
00:44:52,768 --> 00:44:57,988
seen but right now the only the only

923
00:44:56,699 --> 00:45:01,199
thing we've really had to deal with

924
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:03,659
luckily knock on wood for the last three

925
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,969
or four years has been fungus gnats

926
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:09,778
which are more of a nuisance you know

927
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:12,298
they do stick around forever but we've

928
00:45:09,778 --> 00:45:17,219
been really kind of psychotic about

929
00:45:12,298 --> 00:45:18,929
cleanliness and mainly doing all strain

930
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:22,798
development in house and not bringing

931
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:25,528
new cultivars in from other breeders

932
00:45:22,798 --> 00:45:27,838
unless they're like seriously

933
00:45:25,528 --> 00:45:30,358
quarantined yesterday you need to quit

934
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:32,608
you need to have a some SOPs around the

935
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:34,978
quarantine process yeah so we do that

936
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:36,929
and it takes a really long time but as

937
00:45:34,978 --> 00:45:39,778
you saw we bring in new varieties it

938
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:42,179
just it's a very thorough process right

939
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:44,458
and they don't come in for a long time

940
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:49,619
it takes you know three to four months

941
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:52,048
before we're really you know so beyond

942
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:55,079
the point where we're happy to bring in

943
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:57,869
varieties that we have inspected so what

944
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,179
is your expectation for the yield out of

945
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:04,278
this room one hundred and sixty two

946
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:04,278
point three seven five pounds of flour

947
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:11,160
162 pounds in some chain

948
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:13,739
162 pounds okay got it so we have like

949
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:16,679
really good data on yield so our

950
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:18,419
projections like you know we when we

951
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:23,838
make projections on meal that's really

952
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:23,838
close so we should be within 5% of that

953
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:35,429
hopefully better the hopefully above and

954
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:37,319
are there any like you've been growing

955
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:38,909
for a long time are you still learning

956
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:42,170
like are there things you've

957
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:44,789
incorporated into how you cultivate

958
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:48,000
recently that you weren't doing 3-4

959
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:50,429
years ago oh yeah yeah 100% I mean the

960
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,289
mixed spectrum is you know like two

961
00:46:50,429 --> 00:46:54,149
months old something we've done before

962
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:57,150
but never on production it's not

963
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:58,680
something new we wanted to do so you

964
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:00,720
know we could play with the spectrum and

965
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:03,088
kind of ultra throughout the cycle to

966
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:04,799
see if we can maximize yield or terpene

967
00:47:03,088 --> 00:47:08,489
production or cannabinoid production

968
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,500
that's something new we've been growing

969
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:14,039
for rockwool forever so that's not

970
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:16,588
really new we are bringing in a lot more

971
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:19,949
automation so automation on the

972
00:47:16,588 --> 00:47:22,769
irrigation side not something really new

973
00:47:19,949 --> 00:47:24,328
but you using priva which I consider

974
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:26,429
like the rolls-royce of fertigation

975
00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:28,800
that's new for us

976
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:31,259
what like so take as an example the

977
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,180
Vegas facility what's its system so

978
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:36,450
there that one's just a traditional tank

979
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:39,539
system every room has a tank and we have

980
00:47:36,449 --> 00:47:41,549
to mix that takes by hand every week you

981
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:44,759
know and it's a smaller scale facility

982
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:46,650
so like at that scale automation it gets

983
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,020
really expensive you know per square

984
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:53,460
foot so this was big enough where we

985
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:55,259
justified the fertigation system so the

986
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:59,250
pre widgets allows us to have like

987
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:01,349
really precise control and just the

988
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:03,420
expandability and the creativity of

989
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:05,789
things we could do with the Prima to me

990
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:08,369
is exciting you know eventually it'll

991
00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:10,909
also take over our environment so the

992
00:48:08,369 --> 00:48:13,500
lights the irrigation the air flow

993
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:17,420
temperature humidity everything will be

994
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:19,909
automated so once you have the audit

995
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:22,760
and the ability to monitor the data

996
00:48:19,909 --> 00:48:27,739
what's kind of like one thing you're

997
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:32,420
excited to research spectrum you know

998
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:34,338
using using lighting and spectrum to

999
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:36,409
change terpene and cannabinoid profile

1000
00:48:34,338 --> 00:48:38,328
so basically there you could set up this

1001
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:39,798
room with a certain spectrum the room

1002
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:42,140
next door with a different spectrum

1003
00:48:39,798 --> 00:48:43,849
everything else consistent and see what

1004
00:48:42,139 --> 00:48:46,670
the difference is yeah okay we could do

1005
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:48,920
things like adding LEDs like in one

1006
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:51,920
specific part of the spectrum at one

1007
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:54,740
part of the you know flower cycle and

1008
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:58,460
see how that affects things so lighting

1009
00:48:54,739 --> 00:49:00,409
is exciting just like little things like

1010
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,088
pruning techniques you know at this

1011
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:04,039
point we've done so much research it's

1012
00:49:02,088 --> 00:49:07,269
like it's all little things we're doing

1013
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:09,829
research on but like pruning lighting

1014
00:49:07,269 --> 00:49:12,829
always making the plant nutrition better

1015
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:15,798
dialing in our feeds dialing in the dry

1016
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:18,410
back the environment so yeah I just

1017
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:23,509
always trying to do think of whatever we

1018
00:49:18,409 --> 00:49:25,779
can to improve the pre-op operation all

1019
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,780
right

1020
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:06,730
what about are you guys like how much

1021
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:09,850
training are you doing during the

1022
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:12,880
process of the plans we try to do a lot

1023
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:16,029
of training so every week we we try to

1024
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,460
have a training module on a different

1025
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:21,040
part of the cultivation so like this

1026
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:24,300
week we're doing propagation and then

1027
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:27,279
next week we'll do a training module on

1028
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:28,510
loading loading a flour room you know I

1029
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,670
know sorry I was thinking more like

1030
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:32,560
training the plant oh that type of

1031
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:35,950
training so we do zero training

1032
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,090
whatsoever and you know that was one of

1033
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:40,500
the learning curves over the year

1034
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:44,320
training becomes so labor intensive and

1035
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:46,599
it's it's such an art that um production

1036
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,670
it's really hard to do right actually

1037
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:50,799
can we can I walk down yeah let me let

1038
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:53,190
me get you uh yeah you can go down this

1039
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:56,080
road whatever role you want to go down

1040
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:59,889
alright so talk about the philosophy

1041
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,750
while we're walking yeah so for training

1042
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:03,940
like I said we don't do anything any

1043
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:06,219
training at this point these trellis

1044
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:12,400
nets are just supports for the vertical

1045
00:51:06,219 --> 00:51:15,399
growth so it just reduces the labor the

1046
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,880
plants grow naturally and you just put

1047
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:21,039
in trellis nets at different stages to

1048
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:25,840
keep them from falling over when the

1049
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:27,400
flowers get too big and that's our

1050
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,350
that's what we did and sorry you said

1051
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,119
there's one room where you're gonna have

1052
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:33,400
a second level now that's right yeah

1053
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,679
that's an R&amp;D room and so we'll be doing

1054
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,950
a lot of phenotype hunting in that room

1055
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:41,319
will be doing lighting research on LEDs

1056
00:51:38,949 --> 00:51:43,779
so in that room we don't necessarily

1057
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:48,130
need the height because it's more for

1058
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:49,900
research and breeding purposes but once

1059
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:52,019
they leave that room they'll come back

1060
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:54,760
into these rooms for production and

1061
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:58,179
typically how tall are these getting by

1062
00:51:54,760 --> 00:52:00,940
the time they're done they're from the

1063
00:51:58,179 --> 00:52:03,069
table maybe five and a half feet at the

1064
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:05,409
tallest sometimes they'll get too tall

1065
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:07,269
like six feet six and a half we're

1066
00:52:05,409 --> 00:52:09,609
trying to reduce it down to about five

1067
00:52:07,269 --> 00:52:12,070
and a half feet for our big varieties

1068
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:13,800
like Jay one is just a monster it just

1069
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:18,660
keeps going it doesn't stop

1070
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:18,660
but yeah it's already pretty big

1071
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:26,809
[Music]

1072
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:30,049
is that the end of the tour it's the end

1073
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:31,519
of the tour thanks for coming by so I'd

1074
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:34,060
like to get you back though in about

1075
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,630
four weeks yeah these things are massive

1076
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:39,469
we'll do it

1077
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:42,619
oh let's time it for peak LA traffic oh

1078
00:52:39,469 --> 00:52:45,169
yeah there you go I am that that's where

1079
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:47,210
we couldn't come here before there's the

1080
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:48,980
barrier it's all making sense will do

1081
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:53,320
well thank you very good thank you

1082
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:53,320
alright see in a couple weeks
