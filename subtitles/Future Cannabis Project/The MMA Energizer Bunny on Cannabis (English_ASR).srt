1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,890
I had a coach and he was in his 40s and

2
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:06,960
he would be sparring and training with

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:09,480
us for hours and I was like how do you

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,388
do that how you doing that in your 40s

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,410
and he's like smoke weed you know that I

6
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:15,329
smoked weed up

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,868
he's like I'm able to keep up with you

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,570
guys I'm relaxed I'm not using as much

9
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:24,000
energy and I tell you what he was one of

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,359
the best guys in the gym training and

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,089
sparring even in his 40s and he moved

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,880
amazingly well and he could train for a

13
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:35,130
long period of time and there's a few su

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,079
fighters and I will definitely not say

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,950
their names some of them are very vocal

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,410
about their use but some of the guys

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,910
that do triathlons and they were

18
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:47,429
explaining to me they're saying you know

19
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,959
when I get tired you know I'll be in the

20
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,238
middle and I'll start my run he's like I

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,698
take my pen out and I just hit the pen

22
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:55,378
and I'm gone I just get focused and it

23
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:58,500
was just blow it was blowing my mind

24
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:01,439
because I never used and trained I I did

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,480
after I stopped fighting and I shoot

26
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,810
benefits to it I got it I understood

27
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:09,390
what they were saying but yeah I almost

28
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,540
in a weird way I almost feel like it's

29
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,340
cheating in some ways because I'm so not

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,368
in my head I'm just in the moment and

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,750
I'm training and I'm creative and it's

32
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,469
almost not fair when I'm training with

33
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,969
someone because I don't know that's the

34
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,170
other reason why I wish I was using a

35
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:29,158
little bit more when I was fighting

36
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,859
because I never used and trained so in

37
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,259
that regard I definitely found benefits

38
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:37,650
after I was done fighting when I retired

39
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,379
but a lot of guys you know use and are

40
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,750
very active and are performing even

41
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:46,399
better so it it is a performance

42
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,399
enhancer in a lot of ways
