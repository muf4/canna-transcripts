pharmaceutical industry provides

52
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:51,849
valuable insight to the rigorous testing

53
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:54,009
regulations and then we have mr. Antonia

54

the world

58
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,659

Tennessee Valley Authority certifying

68
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:23,259
and verifying final construction of

69
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:26,020
nuclear components Wow that is a really

70
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:27,099
impressive impressive resume Antonio and

71
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,930
I would just really like to say thank

72
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,519
everyone for coming out and I have we

73
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,110
had a few questions that got brought up

74
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,090
but I wanted to open it up to you guys

75
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,920
first because this was a roundtable so

76
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,150
we didn't want to offer insight if you

77
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,919
guys had any specific questions you

78
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,900
wanted to ask well you can go ahead and

79
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:42,699
get into that or we have three questions

80
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,159
that were brought together through the

81
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:46,599
industry are we any questions no

82
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,310
questions to start okay so our first

83
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,840
question that we have is what do you

84
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,430
feel will be the biggest challenges that

85
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,110
coal tomaters or manufacturers will

86
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,849
encounter under the new testing

87
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,350
requirements and I really want to open

88
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:58,750
it up to anybody who feels passionate

89
00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:00,280
about talking about that or if there's

90
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,620
something that you really think that

91
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,030
stands out to you as far as where their

92
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,090
struggles and where the pains are gonna

93
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:10,180
lie in this this transition I don't mind

94
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,069
going for me I think you know what was

95
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,420
interesting is a few years ago when

96
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:15,789
we're moving towards regulations

97
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:16,988
everyone was up in arms about what you

98
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:18,849
know testing labs are gonna be the

99
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:20,860
bottleneck and you know all of this talk

100
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:23,139
and right now it actually is licensing

101
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,820
licensing is the largest bottleneck we

102
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:27,909
have right now and I think the biggest

103
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:30,280
challenge right now is people are have

104
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:32,079
are investing in build-outs and payroll

105
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,519
and they're just waiting and they're

106
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,650
waiting for their licenses and different

107
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,420
stages of it so that's gonna be the

108
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,680
largest challenge I think in not even

109
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:40,719
the next six months probably the next

110
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,360
couple of years is people just waiting

111
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,430
for that whole process to happen and I

112
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,500
think the struggle is gonna be really

113
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,090
magnified for smaller businesses which

114
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,530
is unfortunate because you know this

115
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,629
industry start off with a lot of

116
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,330
passionate people meet with small mom

117
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:56,979
pop businesses and unless you have some

118
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,959
good financial backing it's gonna be

119
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:01,750
hard to stop survive the regulated

120
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,930
market and to survive waiting that whole

121
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,819
process of you know your licensing and

122
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,739
things like that apart from that I think

123
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:10,180
that largest challenge is that we've all

124
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,009
had and I think testing labs it

125
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,810
magnified is we had different

126
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:15,579
regulations that dropped on us every six

127
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,569
months and now I'm hearing that there's

128
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,230
rumors that there might be another

129
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:19,180
package

130
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,009
that might drop our way about

131
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,329
regulations in the next few months again

132
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:27,490
so yes oh absolutely the the regulations

133
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:29,259
as far as licensing is concerned I can

134
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,790
only imagine what it's like in your

135
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,759
world I've worked in regulations on

136
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,620
every other thing but testing and I can

137
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,519
only imagine what you guys have to go

138
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,180
through to be able to get the

139
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:41,829
certifications that you need I would

140
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,240
just say making the industry a little

141
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:48,789
more reasonable coming from other

142
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,470
industry challenges just there's so much

143
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,280
waste so much extra cost

144
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,910
no improv certification there's no

145
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,679
standardization whether it be of

146
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,330
standards themselves so labs are doing

147
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,740
different things and saying the

148
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:01,779
instruments off of different standards

149
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,040
and just making any chaos for especially

150
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:04,599
like she said producers and

151
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,360
manufacturers who don't have a lot of

152
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,550
money to lab shop and to test all day

153
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,020
every day it really is kind of there

154
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,639
could be a lot smarter processes

155
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,709
involved at our mimics all across the

156
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,439
other industries whether it be CCV fail

157
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:19,239
rates I mean 100 percent failure

158
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,709
passer / CCP makes no sense it's just

159
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,850
this extra cost and it's really

160
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:25,019
difficult to operate that way

161
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:27,520
so yeah just making it more sensible

162
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:29,019
please explain so your quality

163
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,699
parameters a hundred percent of your

164
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:32,709
analytes have to fail so for all the

165
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:34,719
pesticides that I'm sorry I have to pass

166
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:37,239
I'm sorry so for all the pesticides that

167
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,340
we test for every run if any analyte

168
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,100
fails or fails falls outside the puss of

169
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:44,169
my 30% range you cannot release that

170
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,300
badge although that analyte may have not

171
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,150
hit it may have not been an issue and in

172
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,379
other industries they account for that

173
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,789
but saying if you don't see that and the

174
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:53,980
light it doesn't have to pass you know

175
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,210
if you don't see it if you know that

176
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,439
there's nothing present if you have non

177
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:58,239
detect there's no reason for that

178
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:01,600
quality and I'd like to have to pass and

179
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,310
that would make us oh a lot less reruns

180
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,010
and reap reps and things like that

181
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,959
there's a cost to us I think what he's

182
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:10,990
referring to is that for every batch

183
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:13,000
that we have to analyze this 20 samples

184
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,470
in a batch you have to do at least four

185
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,779
QC s which are internal quality control

186
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,870
samples most of us run probably five or

187
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:21,119
six of those and out of those everything

188
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,199
has to fall within a certain

189
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,389
specification right and if anything

190
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,399
comes out of it you have to rerun that

191
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,629
entire batch the way it works in other

192
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:30,909
industries I come from the farm

193
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:33,879
suta coal industry and also an FDA and

194
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:36,189
EPA is that you can run control charts

195
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:37,930
which means that you can track what are

196
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:39,519
typical recoveries for these guys even

197
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,319
if it there are outside those parameters

198
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,689
as long as they're predictable and you

199
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,579
have data on them unfortunately we're

200
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:48,370
not dealing with a lot of scientists at

201
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:49,599
the VCC so we end up having to have

202
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,459
these trig but they're essentially

203
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,800
regulators that tell us nope the

204
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:55,359
regulation says 17 to 1:30 has to be

205
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,040
there there's not there's no leeway

206
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,370
there's no understanding there's no

207
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,590
scientific discussion we can talk about

208
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,660
the 800-pound gorilla that's sitting in

209
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,369
the room so there is maybe six or seven

210
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,310
examples of what the real problem is and

211
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:11,620
it's the BCC they don't know shit about

212
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,110
cannabis testing they have an ego they

213
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,610
don't want to go and in every states the

214
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,259
same way they all have an ego because

215
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,879
they used to be the guy that worked in

216
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,529
the health department and now he got

217
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,480
this new gig doing cannabis and he wants

218
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:23,609
to you know I read High Times and I

219
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,170
fucking know what I'm talking about

220
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,879
so it's the problem is is that these

221
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,350
guys are there and they're in charge and

222
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,879
they have this ego and they don't want

223
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,730
to look at other states that have failed

224
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,680
and figured out these problems and at

225
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,689
the same time I promise you right now

226
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,430
they're not gonna come rescue you

227
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:40,870
they're gonna wait for attrition to

228
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,310
occur and let the labs all go out of

229
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,379
business and screw each other and fall

230
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,430
apart and they because they get to sit

231
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:47,680
there with their hands up with no

232
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,030
liability they have no infrastructure

233
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,680
they don't know what the fuck they're

234
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:53,139
doing and it's ultimately making

235
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,480
everybody from the laboratories to the

236
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:58,329
like the process that he spoke about if

237
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,920
you're if you're a producer I mean I'm

238
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:02,229
lucky enough to have been in the lab end

239
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,449
and then said fuck this this is this is

240
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,069
cool you guys do this awesome like oh

241
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,449
the other the plugs are covered the

242
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,189
babies won't electrocute themselves all

243
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:10,539
right awesome and jump back into the

244
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,790
other end of it which is the fun part

245
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,830
which is making products and you know

246
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,870
growing cannabis and doing that shit so

247
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:19,599
now I get to see the this end of it and

248
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:21,970
you're literally just you're a victim if

249
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,850
you're the lab owner you're a victim if

250
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,830
you're the whatever you know licensed

251
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,300
owner because the BCC doesn't know what

252
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:29,229
the fuck they're doing and they're not

253
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,159
gonna pull their head out of their ass

254
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:34,659
any time soon so it's up to the what I

255
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:39,098
would what I would suggest everyone to

256
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:40,449
do is scale down just fucking do it like

257
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,620
you did when you trapped scale down

258
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,420
build up

259
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,070
put money back in do it as safe as you

260
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,229
possibly can for the period of time

261
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,690
because like she said either big

262
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,519
investors don't want to come in if they

263
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,560
do they want to take everything or

264
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,379
leverage it so that when you fail they

265
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:57,759
take it so the real trick is is keep

266
00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:00,399
doing what you do

267
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,289
keep going to bed early getting up early

268
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,419
or going to bed late getting up early

269
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:06,789
grinding grinding grinding and building

270
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,990
the business because that's that's what

271
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:10,329
it's gonna take and that's what you have

272
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,710
to do to get through because you're not

273
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,500
getting any you know you're not getting

274
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,970
air help you know air survival help from

275
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,350
the plains above because there's no

276
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,570
fucking planes above they're not gonna

277
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,040
back you up they want to see you die so

278
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,450
they could literally like fortnight jump

279
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,339
up and take all your shit and bounce out

280
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,110
like they don't care and they're gonna

281
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,120
let us rip each other apart they love it

282
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,250
they literally love it and the

283
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,169
difference between NorCal and SoCal that

284
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,279
is the most because I was in NorCal for

285
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:35,110
a long time so I know a lot of the

286
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,360
owners and the business guys up there

287
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,840
came down to SoCal and got into it down

288
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,279
here it's insane the difference like

289
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,889
what you'd get away with as a producer

290
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,209
in NorCal to SoCal and and I don't

291
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:48,610
understand why they're not on the same

292
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,930
page but then I do because their heads

293
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,629
up their ass and they're not gonna be on

294
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:56,319
the same page so it's it's ridiculous it

295
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:57,700
is but it's it's the BCC they're fuckers

296
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,940
they're not gonna get their head out of

297
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:03,460
their ass go ahead yeah one more thing

298
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:06,340
though this panel I hope it doesn't turn

299
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,930
into no offense like a science fucking

300
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,330
panel where you're just it's we're

301
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:11,709
sitting here understanding analytics and

302
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:16,150
other stuff and then everyone out there

303
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:17,830
is like okay so anyway yeah fair enough

304
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,319
fair enough I'm not going that round I

305
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,550
promise but to his point I love its

306
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,230
perspective because he's been the lab

307
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:24,939
bed as well as the producer and I think

308
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,500
that's the key is that honestly you have

309
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,850
to talk to your lab you have to get

310
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,250
educated I mean we're seeing a lot of

311
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,950
good brands starting to educate make

312
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,419
good media and marketing material to

313
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,100
explain some of this stuff and I

314
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:37,659
encourage you because when the BCC opens

315
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,980
up for comment they take him pretty

316
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:40,719
seriously I mean I was kind of

317
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,000
flabbergasted by just some of the things

318
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,160
that made it and when they explain why

319
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,110
it's kind of some guys submitted it from

320
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:48,579
this I mean I don't know who this guy

321
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,169
was but like literally somebody

322
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,879
submitted some of the same rules

323
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:53,769
took it believed it and ran with it cuz

324
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:55,149
no one else said don't do it so really

325
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,289
you're gonna have to speak up you're

326
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:58,360
gonna have to become educated about

327
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,949
what's going on speak to your lab ask

328
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,570
them what their problems are because I

329
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,950
promise you we will talk to you and we

330
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,320
will ask for your help and we will try

331
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,090
to work with you to to accomplish and

332
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,250
trap these weird and ever-shifting

333
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:11,440
waters that is California cannabis right

334
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,299
and I mean it's not just a BCC I think

335
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,630
it's all the regulator's right the the

336
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:18,669
regulator's perspective on the cannabis

337
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:21,279
industry is can we start on the labeling

338
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:22,599
yeah yeah I'm just saying the

339
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,360
regulator's perspective on the industry

340
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,190
is that it is they still come up from it

341
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,680
that it's a criminal sort of point of

342
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:32,440
view and it's a very hostile kind of

343
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,639
relationship and the only way you're

344
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,170
gonna survive is by looking out for

345
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,279
yourself and so the way I say it is you

346
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:38,769
have to trust each other and have to

347
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,360
trust the labs - right it's the industry

348
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:42,460
tends to have this sort of adversarial

349
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,690
relationship with labs and we really

350
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,269
just sort of break that barrier and

351
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,740
encourage more transparency I think most

352
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:49,659
of the labs now are willing to share

353
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,129
information willing to share data you

354
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:53,500
know use them as a tool there's a lot of

355
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:55,809
scientists that are at the disposal that

356
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,639
can show you a few things and we also

357
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:59,769
would like to learn more about the other

358
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:00,669
side of it and about production and when

359
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:02,529
you come together and do that

360
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:04,209
collaborative kind of thing is when you

361
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:07,000
get really good products that are

362
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,280
high-quality and are safe I think from

363
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,409
the customer side you know having been

364
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,240
from the lab side and coming over what

365
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:15,519
the customer really wants is labs to be

366
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,980
honest about the fact that they're

367
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,809
imperfect and they make mistakes and

368
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,889
then the customer needs to understand

369
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:23,229
that until everything is completely

370
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:26,110
machine automated you have human error

371
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:28,330
you're never gonna get around it so what

372
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,610
I would my approach to it running lacked

373
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,740
Ernests and you know having the licenses

374
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,320
and building this facility now when I

375
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:38,110
was there I just worked with for you

376
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,070
know found for the best labs because one

377
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,899
of them is gonna be really good at

378
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,760
handling volume another one is gonna be

379
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:44,470
really good at picking up shit when it

380
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:46,389
has to go really quick another one's

381
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,860
gonna be great and you just juggle them

382
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:50,460
and sort it and then you know you're

383
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,750
testing them your your your you know

384
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,850
homogenizing test samples and testing

385
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,769
their business and but having like he's

386
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,480
saying having interaction with them but

387
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:01,569
i think from the lab and what lab owners

388
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,920
need to do more is admit openly a

389
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,690
hundred percent that it's

390
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,120
not gonna be perfect things are gonna

391
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,610
get messed up and then you know discount

392
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,230
and credit people back because even me

393
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,060
working with steeple and I'm not at

394
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,370
Steve Hill now I have trouble getting

395
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,958
them to credit back and I'm like who the

396
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,028
fuck are you talking about

397
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,919
no and it's just how it is but I believe

398
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:22,419
in that completely and I do agree about

399
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:24,059
the honesty but I know cuz I've done

400
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:26,289
this and I've done this repeatedly is

401
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:28,778
the other side has to understand as well

402
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:30,849
because people just walk away oh so it's

403
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:32,409
like hey there was this error this error

404
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,909
might have been internal it might have

405
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:35,799
been external but this is an explanation

406
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:38,110
for it and people usually are like well

407
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:39,189
then I'm just leaving and the truth is

408
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,360
if you want to build a business model

409
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:45,670
you have to build in and error rate well

410
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,370
we we actually we actually do actually

411
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:50,528
credit back we guarantee all our tests

412
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,149
so we do guaran I feel like what this is

413
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:53,889
similar to where we are right now with

414
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:55,690
software right like the cannabis world

415
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:58,028
of software we're at a place where it's

416
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,260
like you we're really trying POS systems

417
00:13:58,028 --> 00:14:01,328
right we're really trying to have a

418
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:03,039
great POS system but like we're all

419
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:04,359
learning in the process and like it

420
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,230
seems like we've got all the instruction

421
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,909
and it works really great with my

422
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,649
QuickBooks but there's this one function

423
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:10,149
that's not as great because when we

424
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:12,250
built this software we had this one

425
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,139
focus or we had the other focus so I

426
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,610
really think that like the testing world

427
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:17,439
I got us on the saying you know we have

428
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,019
the strengths and we're all kind of

429
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,160
growing together as we you know develop

430
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:23,289
this industry and kind of figure out

431
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:26,078
what what the standards really are right

432
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:28,179
because standards are kind of a relative

433
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,289
term in in the the world of we're

434
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:31,208
actually dealing with right the

435
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:33,309
standards that we're comparing and

436
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,838
contrasting against sure so I think I I

437
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:37,719
mean this is kind of a segue to my next

438
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,100
question with the standards and all of

439
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,930
that what do you think needs to be

440
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,420
addressed in the regulations as they

441
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:44,889
stand right now if you had and obviously

442
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:47,620
not that their heads are up their asses

443
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:50,409
but if we can have a point as to what if

444
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,448
you were like hey I think my for

445
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:54,068
instance is I don't quite understand

446
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:56,889
what the world of the difference between

447
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:58,659
a sublingual pill or a pill you swallow

448
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:00,789
being one as a concentrate and one is an

449
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:03,399
edible right so as a testing person

450
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:05,559
please explain to me how if I put it on

451
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,000
my tongue and it dissolves that it is

452
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,578
considered an edible but if I swallow a

453
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,990
whole pill its considered to concentrate

454
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:13,509
how do you treat that if I came to you

455
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,060
as a question like how would you tell me

456
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,230
like I

457
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:16,729
a good answer for that would you be

458
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:20,080
honestly I mean maybe the person that

459
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:23,269
made the rules head is up their ass okay

460
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,400
that specific rule was actually put in

461
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:27,559
to help people who have made

462
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:31,189
ethanol-based pictures so they had to

463
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:33,079
have a separate section so that people

464
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:35,390
who had ethanol and there weren't held

465
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,610
to the ethanol standards in solvents and

466
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:40,100
so they had to make the special category

467
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,320
for tinctures to allow people who made

468
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,899
ethanol based tinctures allowed to sell

469
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,760
it on the market so that was the reason

470
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:47,929
for that but my mine and I'm gonna get a

471
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,049
little technical just for two seconds

472
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:53,929
but my worst one is still that we have

473
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:55,609
to fail category one pesticides based on

474
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:57,139
a limit of detection that if I had to

475
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,899
change like I do a magic one and just

476
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:00,769
change that that would be the one

477
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:02,240
regulation I would love to change so

478
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:04,100
what would you change it to I would

479
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,259
change it to an actual action level so

480
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,269
the reason the reason right now that we

481
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:10,279
have to deal with this issue is that you

482
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:13,370
know we might have the most competent

483
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,470
labs here and hopefully we do right here

484
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,060
and each of our limits of detection of

485
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,430
each of these labs would be totally

486
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:21,259
different and and so now you're actually

487
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:23,479
increasing lab shopping because

488
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:25,490
someone's like well if I fail at point O

489
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,470
3 and this person's LOD is this and this

490
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,450
is this I'm gonna go with this lab and

491
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,940
so you're almost rewarding people who

492
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,650
have less sensitive instrumentation less

493
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,020
sensitive methods and so the people who

494
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:37,909
invested into it and try to get it as

495
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:39,710
right as possible end up getting screwed

496
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:41,449
so I've heard this a lot about our lab

497
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:43,009
board they're like you know I would love

498
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,330
to use you for R&amp;D but you know just for

499
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:46,580
compliance I'm not gonna take the risk

500
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:49,009
because your LEDs are too low and what

501
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,480
you need is an actual action level which

502
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:53,139
it makes a level playing field for

503
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,490
everyone so that would be my one I

504
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:56,899
totally agree with that love that and I

505
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,279
wouldn't even want to change the rule I

506
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:00,709
just want more transparency I would love

507
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,689
the BCC to report on who's actually

508
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,340
sitting in reports to them because we're

509
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,900
having new labs lab shopping they were

510
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:07,869
found out through conversation that a

511
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,370
lot of these Co ways that are being

512
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:12,409
submitted with product aren't actually

513
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:13,879
being submitted to the BCC so therefore

514
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,710
some labs aren't under as much scrutiny

515
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,510
as the labs are compliant and sending

516
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,130
their reports up and being better every

517
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:20,299
single night as I submit so there's

518
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,130
different things like that that I know

519
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:24,379
we talked about prior that it will fix

520
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,910
yourself in measuring metrics should

521
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,589
that metric should hold more

522
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,210
accountability but that's a hard thing

523
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,619
they're really sell I mean even from a

524
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,910
laugh it's like oh we're gonna regulate

525
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:33,799
harder you know it's a hard thing to

526
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,570
really talk to your clients about and

527
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:37,399
really get them excited yeah we're gonna

528
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:39,679
make you test more we're gonna take more

529
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,060
of your money it's not that you know it

530
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,890
helps the consumer safety and help the

531
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:44,990
industry but there's nothing that has a

532
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,100
lab you can really go out there and hold

533
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,720
your head on because it's not really

534
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,889
gonna be a friendly sell to everyone

535
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,660
that's got to spend more money when

536
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:52,520
measure comes online but yeah it's

537
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,500
coming in and will help but right now if

538
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:56,930
you just simply just let everyone know

539
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,940
who's reporting cos who's actually doing

540
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:01,100
a right which labs are participating in

541
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,269
the ecosystem I think that'll change a

542
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,649
lot of things because you'll be could

543
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:05,629
have to be able to use that to say well

544
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,970
yeah yeah you left me cuz we had a

545
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,320
problem the lab you went to is a report

546
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,120
and C always there that are not really

547
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:12,470
compliant they're halfway compliant and

548
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,179
when something happens it's gonna come

549
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,029
back to you because you because you

550
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,370
chose to go to this less equipped

551
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:21,740
laboratory by the same vein I feel like

552
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:24,319
the BCC should have like a public list

553
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,509
of they are you know we hear sort of

554
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,829
through rumors and other clients that

555
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:30,440
there's certain labs that are not

556
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:33,740
allowed to do regulate a regulatory

557
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,269
compliance and or the BCC says yes so

558
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,099
and so we're pulling so-and-so's license

559
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:38,629
it would be nice to have a little more

560
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:41,149
public database about this so that

561
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:44,060
everyone knows which labs are okay in

562
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,680
which don't I mean by the same on the

563
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:47,269
same vein I wish they would publicize

564
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,180
some of their audits I mean some of us

565
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:51,799
have been audited extensively and for

566
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,990
months at a time and they'll keep going

567
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,730
back and forth and you know it's almost

568
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,470
worse than if you can survive a nice

569
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,000
audit so I almost wish they would

570
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,980
actually you know we get a little bit of

571
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,329
like we survive this or like the BC says

572
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,160
auditor does and then that way people

573
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:05,539
know when they're differentiating which

574
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,350
labs have been audited and which haven't

575
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:10,089
been audited anything that you would

576
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:12,589
change

577
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:13,759
besides heads up asses old days head

578
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:15,079
there's like whole thing learnt the

579
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,519
whole thing and changed no I wouldn't

580
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:18,019
say that I mean I think I think there

581
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:19,910
are things there's a lot of stuff that

582
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:23,119
they are doing well and there's a lot of

583
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:25,340
stuff that that I think people that own

584
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,919
companies the the problem in cannabis

585
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:29,240
that I have mostly is that everyone says

586
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,620
they're working hard and you're fucking

587
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,900
not

588
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:39,109
that's my biggest issue that's a little

589
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:40,880
unfair I'm sorry everyone I see a bunch

590
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:42,379
of immigrants that are trying to get in

591
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,409
the United States that work very fucking

592
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,909
hard and I see people that that do what

593
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:48,710
they say they're gonna do and bust their

594
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:50,270
ass and then I see a bunch of people who

595
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,370
make money and start to get real fucking

596
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:54,400
comfy and start chewing on the carbs and

597
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:56,808
and running their mouths and not

598
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,038
diversify in their business and trusting

599
00:19:56,808 --> 00:19:59,750
other people and bringing them in and

600
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:01,369
actually running a business correctly I

601
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,440
see a lot of people in cannabis that

602
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:04,668
that spend more time on Instagram than

603
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,220
they do running their fucking business

604
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:09,230
and listening to their employees so my

605
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,028
point is is there's a ton of fucking

606
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,038
people that have these companies that

607
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:14,869
want a bitch and complain and blame the

608
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,269
BOE and blame the labs blame your

609
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:19,278
fucking self it's like getting get your

610
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:21,379
shit to work dude do it like you did

611
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:22,640
before you got this shit do it like you

612
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,679
did when the cops were in the review

613
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,140
mirror and whatever else like grind

614
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:28,909
motherfucker because if you don't you're

615
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,919
not gonna have anything like it no one's

616
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:33,830
gonna save you the beat I hope the point

617
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:36,288
is getting through that the bcc's not

618
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:38,480
gonna save you that's your competitors

619
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:41,419
not gonna save you get so fucking work

620
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,700
well and like i see hash makers nicotine

621
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:45,710
right there I see hash makers that make

622
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,840
good hash that have better work ethic

623
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,298
than their CEOs of other fucking

624
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,009
companies that want to be grant gardens

625
00:20:50,298 --> 00:20:55,429
that are fucking I'm on their fucking

626
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:57,019
jet fuck your jet like georgette cost

627
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:59,330
your company a bunch of money that

628
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:01,429
you're blowing that you're lying about

629
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:04,158
because you're like I love this one now

630
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:06,110
oh we we pay to have a big display in

631
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,940
your store and then we sell you shit but

632
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:09,408
the shit doesn't sell and we tell our

633
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,298
investors that that's that that's our

634
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:13,130
marketing money what the fuck you doing

635
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:15,408
dude that's not working hard that's

636
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,760
bullshit well that's a big way to what's

637
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:18,559
what they said earlier which was the

638
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,990
lack of preparation for the long the

639
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:24,379
long haul right a short time and time

640
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,970
again you know we do I do due diligence

641
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,110
for investment companies and I basically

642
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,000
just rattled the cages of these

643
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:30,859
businesses and one of the things I see

644
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,648
more often than not is they need less

645
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:35,089
than a year of bleeded money right and

646
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:37,750
I'm like oh you think you're gonna be

647
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:39,939
making $500,000 a year nine

648
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,859
ten months 11 months in and then it just

649
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,139
continues on this projection of like

650
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:46,089
straight up that's not realistic and I

651
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:47,979
think I mean I think we're tech I've

652
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:49,000
even seen labs with the same types of

653
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,500
pitch you know where they're like oh

654
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,628
we're gonna be testing everybody and I'm

655
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,089
like okay let's be realistic like this

656
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:56,558
isn't this isn't just a computer that

657
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:58,750
spins once you get the program and it

658
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,788
just operates right like this isn't tech

659
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,038
this is still human beings this is still

660
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:04,929
people people cost money training all of

661
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:07,960
this infrastructure is a lot a lot of

662
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:10,389
work so in your opinion if somebody was

663
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,340
asking to invest get an investment right

664
00:22:10,388 --> 00:22:14,709
start a testing company how many years

665
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:18,490
of in the red do you think you need to

666
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:20,019
ask for one maybe two three years I feel

667
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:27,009
bad for anyone who wants to start a

668
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:30,388
testing lab right now hitting me up to

669
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:32,649
go to China to make testing labs to test

670
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:35,558
components before they come to the US

671
00:22:32,648 --> 00:22:37,058
because they like if I have if I had up

672
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:38,079
ten bucks for every one I'd have more

673
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:40,928
money than everyone in the room like

674
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,829
it's insane how much and it's not listen

675
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:43,830
it's not a good idea

676
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:49,028
company you're looking at you have to

677
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,470
get your annual permitting you have to

678
00:22:49,028 --> 00:22:52,298
do build-out you have to do you're

679
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:55,028
looking at two to two and a half million

680
00:22:52,298 --> 00:22:56,798
in initially with probably no money

681
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:58,480
through the door for a year at least

682
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,128
you're competing with and yeah you

683
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,610
compete with people who are been in the

684
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:05,199
game yeah and who are ISO accredit who

685
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:07,000
know and then we have a year's a head

686
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,740
start on you which again I'm not

687
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,839
discouraging anyone if you have the

688
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,730
money please go for it it's also the

689
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:15,759
fact that right now the compliance

690
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,409
market is flat the number of tests that

691
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,669
if you look at just the BCC's compliance

692
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:20,980
market the number of tests that you see

693
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:22,929
are being tested every month it's

694
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,788
literally just been flat there's there's

695
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:26,769
there's been no movement for the last

696
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:30,398
six months it's about and the black

697
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:32,319
market grows where no testing and it

698
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:34,058
almost won't unless it's forced in

699
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,740
Colorado I worked for school and we had

700
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:38,168
all these classes we had Nicole Devesh a

701
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,298
manufacturing legal all this legal and

702
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:42,580
compliance ten students how to grow weed

703
00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:43,720
150 yes and it was like really you don't

704
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:45,009
care whether or not you lose your

705
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,419
business that's not the interest and

706
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:47,429
it's not until we get to a point of

707
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:49,619
where they're really push

708
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:50,788
that people start to pay attention and

709
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:52,738
make sure that they're going with the

710
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:54,898
right lab right right now they can shop

711
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:56,369
you guys in six months hopefully fingers

712
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:58,408
crossed once we start getting these

713
00:23:56,368 --> 00:24:00,388
numbers put into metric it'll be much

714
00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:02,399
more visible where it's like no you

715
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:03,868
you're going with the company that in

716
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:05,968
your mind was doing well but look at

717
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:08,158
these numbers this is not doing well you

718
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:10,169
were getting placated on them giving you

719
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,899
some numbers that they wanted but I also

720
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:14,788
have seen kind of companies go down and

721
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:17,368
then go back up in the way of like

722
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:19,079
they're very very exists right and so is

723
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:21,058
this something that you know they

724
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:22,618
realize that their machines need to be

725
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:24,388
tested and they're fixed and they

726
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:25,858
calibrate and then we go back is this

727
00:24:24,388 --> 00:24:27,658
something that happens in a lab like

728
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:29,158
there are variation that the lab will

729
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,330
experience because I feel like I've

730
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,979
worked with companies where I'm like

731
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:34,079
everything's great and then one day it's

732
00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:35,249
like totally different whoa best happen

733
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,798
right now because people aren't

734
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:39,118
regulated well enough because okay once

735
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:40,888
everything settles in you'll have to

736
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:42,868
report your mat your view your changes

737
00:24:40,888 --> 00:24:44,038
you'll be safe I mean yeah it's just

738
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:45,478
it's just in regulate like that's the

739
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:46,829
kind of stuff you can get right now

740
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:48,899
people can get away with doing that but

741
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:52,288
at some point that won't be tolerable in

742
00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:53,968
the BCC you will hopefully have a you

743
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:55,798
generally see that when people don't

744
00:24:53,969 --> 00:24:57,509
have redundancy in the lab so if you're

745
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:59,700
dependent on just one or two instruments

746
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:02,190
and your instruments go down and yeah

747
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,359
exactly so when I talk about boolean to

748
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,710
million dollar investment I'm just

749
00:25:03,358 --> 00:25:06,358
talking for one set of instrumentation

750
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,558
if you really want to stay ahead of the

751
00:25:06,358 --> 00:25:09,509
curve you have to have two sets of

752
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:12,178
everything at least you know if yeah I

753
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:13,679
mean redundancy is is the key if you

754
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,989
don't want to see those fluctuations

755
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,339
right if you're a laboratory and you if

756
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:20,608
you're gonna start a laboratory what you

757
00:25:17,338 --> 00:25:22,710
do is you sell machine run time because

758
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:24,868
everything else is bullshit if you go to

759
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,338
a lab here's here's how it works this is

760
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:29,819
I'll help you bust every lab in the

761
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:33,118
world if you go to a lab and they have

762
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:36,058
one set of equipment the time it takes

763
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:37,858
to take your samples and prep them is X

764
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:40,678
amount of time it's 24 hours in the day

765
00:25:37,858 --> 00:25:43,348
the time it takes to then run the

766
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,999
machine in in the you know to load it up

767
00:25:43,348 --> 00:25:46,499
and run the machine and okay big buddy

768
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:46,979
showing what you got the time it takes

769
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:48,598
to do that

770
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:50,249
that takes certain amount of time that's

771
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:52,048
machine run time time it takes you take

772
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:53,999
the information out of there decipher it

773
00:25:52,048 --> 00:25:56,489
break it down put it back over I mean

774
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:58,919
it's all this time so if they only have

775
00:25:56,489 --> 00:26:00,269
one set of equipment and they're selling

776
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,788
at the lowest price and they have a

777
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:06,209
ton of customers that's not going to end

778
00:26:02,788 --> 00:26:07,288
well right and that's the like I'll be

779
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:09,599
honest that's what steep that was

780
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:11,459
fucking idiots stupidest shit

781
00:26:09,598 --> 00:26:13,918
pissed me off I'm like what are you guys

782
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:15,028
doing if this is a grow room you fucking

783
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,999
everyone will be dead we'd have no money

784
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:20,398
and it's like so the point is is if

785
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:21,899
you're not paying attention to your

786
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:23,189
business and doing it correctly no

787
00:26:21,898 --> 00:26:26,518
matter what it is you know what the real

788
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:28,019
issue is human beings people you don't

789
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:29,368
want to work hard you're fucking lazy

790
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,308
you don't wanna do what you got to do

791
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:35,069
all right get the progress note in and

792
00:26:32,308 --> 00:26:36,749
the other thing look at right now I'm

793
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:38,489
starting to I'm starting to go and

794
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:40,588
getting really interested in bio hacking

795
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:41,848
and human bio hacking and human

796
00:26:40,588 --> 00:26:43,348
optimization and all this cool shit

797
00:26:41,848 --> 00:26:45,208
there's a whole entire industry of

798
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:47,009
people that are in this when you get to

799
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:48,749
these people coming from cannabis you

800
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:51,690
meet these people and these people don't

801
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:53,219
lie they're fucking nice it's totally

802
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:55,379
different when you talk to your

803
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:57,419
modification it's just everyone in

804
00:26:55,378 --> 00:26:59,009
cannabis is this creepy burnt-out

805
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:01,139
maverick that wants to fucking rip

806
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:03,298
everyone off and they can't be honest

807
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:08,819
well no I mean the good people aren't

808
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:10,288
but the other they don't want to be

809
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:11,968
honest and they're not honest with

810
00:27:10,288 --> 00:27:14,249
themselves enough and they and it's like

811
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:16,950
our industry is this fucking weird place

812
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:18,149
where shady shit can go down and no one

813
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,828
says anything about it and it's like

814
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:22,199
there was a panel earlier about open

815
00:27:19,828 --> 00:27:23,428
source in the mic in the machine's room

816
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,190
and I think this is a really valuable

817
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:28,259
point to talk about open source in that

818
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,308
way and the fact that we need to get to

819
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:32,128
a point you know there's a lot of fear

820
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:33,778
and like putting on a job making a point

821
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:35,519
what was that I think that the entire

822
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:37,319
industry's problem is that you have bad

823
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:44,700
gut health and you're making horrible

824
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:46,828
decisions too much sugar we only have a

825
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,229
couple more minutes does anybody have

826
00:27:46,828 --> 00:27:51,499
any questions about testing saman yes

827
00:27:49,229 --> 00:27:51,499
please

828
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:11,749
it isn't that hard you shouldn't have

829
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,879
any issues with it we build our own

830
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:17,629
in-house lymph system and it's tied to

831
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:19,339
every calibration how often do you have

832
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:24,888
to calibrate yeah wait I wanted to

833
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:26,808
understand the questions so you you know

834
00:28:24,888 --> 00:28:28,368
there is no requirement for how many

835
00:28:26,808 --> 00:28:29,598
times you calibrate most of us end up

836
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:31,999
calibrating multiple times a week

837
00:28:29,598 --> 00:28:34,339
because our QCs have to fall within spec

838
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:37,460
your Q sees fall out of spec if your

839
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:39,378
calibration is not right so there it's

840
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,999
more about it's more it's think of it

841
00:28:39,378 --> 00:28:42,199
more from an industrial point of view

842
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:44,118
right you're running your things you

843
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,009
have certain specifications to me when

844
00:28:44,118 --> 00:28:47,538
that specification fall out of it you

845
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:55,038
have to do adjustments to make it come

846
00:28:47,538 --> 00:28:56,719
within spec validation oh the validation

847
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:57,888
of yes we do have there so if you look

848
00:28:56,719 --> 00:29:00,528
at the regs there's this whole section

849
00:28:57,888 --> 00:29:01,848
on validations you have to you have to

850
00:29:00,528 --> 00:29:08,210
put all that package together for

851
00:29:01,848 --> 00:29:10,338
initial validation yeah parameters I

852
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,869
mean and then into a point like so your

853
00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:13,969
your karna controls go out of spec the

854
00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:15,168
more you test so for us we work

855
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:16,249
everybody once a week then it was

856
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,960
multiple times a week because you're

857
00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:20,149
testing more stuff and the stuff that's

858
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,558
dirty or it could be stranger matrixes

859
00:29:20,148 --> 00:29:28,699
it's just a bit of what you're testing I

860
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:30,618
mean multiple internal standards so each

861
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,210
method has their own internal standards

862
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:34,699
sometimes they have you know 10 15

863
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,899
internal standards actually more

864
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,609
internal standards actually help you

865
00:29:35,898 --> 00:29:39,348
stay within spec right now we're all

866
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:40,908
playing a game of how do we stay within

867
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:42,468
spec as long as possible because you

868
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:44,269
want to increase that capacity which

869
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:45,769
means that the way to increase the

870
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:48,169
capacity is to run less of those

871
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:50,210
internal Q C's and more of the customer

872
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:52,129
samples but then you don't that means

873
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,929
you need those QC s to pass so there's

874
00:29:52,128 --> 00:29:56,028
this sort of like recurring cycle you

875
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:58,519
have to keep this is why this is the

876
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:59,450
whole point of a quality system and it's

877
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:01,249
interesting because I was on another

878
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:03,139
panel about you know like looking at

879
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:05,419
they were the extractors we're talking

880
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:07,069
about that internal check and they're

881
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:08,749
like we need this and everything that

882
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:10,788
they're saying we've been doing this for

883
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:12,319
years and you know things have to be

884
00:30:10,788 --> 00:30:13,878
within spec if it's not wouldn't spec

885
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,858
it's a cyclical process that you keep

886
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:17,928
checking and rechecking to stay within

887
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:19,389
that spec and it's almost like the rest

888
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:20,920
of the industry is now catching

889
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,720
- what we've been doing it which is why

890
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,670
I'm saying like that collaborative kind

891
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,140
of sharing of informations if you want

892
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,308
to know how to write a good SOP talk to

893
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,440
your lab we've been writing this for

894
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:34,740
ages alright my quick question for you

895
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,740
is the run why did you ask that question

896
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,970
no all right there is my question the

897
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,920
reason why I asked you that question is

898
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,870
because when you asked your question I

899
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,940
put my mic down and I said to the two of

900
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:02,349
them the reason why he's asking that is

901
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:06,090
because that's the greatest fucking lie

902
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:08,709
that every lad tells us besides it's bad

903
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:11,349
standards the fucking standards are the

904
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,799
calibrations

905
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:16,509
[Music]

906
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:18,940
they have them this is my they all have

907
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:20,619
this would understand let me just be the

908
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,660
one to say this to everybody every

909
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:26,319
fucking lab that wants to be successful

910
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:31,150
if you want to stump a lab are you ISO

911
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:32,349
17025 certified that's it because all of

912
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,850
the things you're talking about it's

913
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:36,699
already there and if what you're saying

914
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:38,679
I can just I can already tell I look at

915
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:45,190
you young man and I can see how you've

916
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:51,009
been it's horrible although I'll hug you

917
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:52,870
when we get done it's not think of it

918
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:55,779
this way think of this think of a lab

919
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:57,789
this way when you look at a factory and

920
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:59,319
there's conveyor belts in a factory and

921
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:00,549
every fucking things moving in a

922
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:02,379
different direction and those conveyor

923
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:04,299
belts are so tightly worked that a

924
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,370
package falls off goes to the next comes

925
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:08,349
through that's what a lab really is and

926
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:09,969
if anything is out of fucking line the

927
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:11,169
package shoots off the other I want to I

928
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,279
want to hear this though I want to hear

929
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:23,730
about the order of magnitude difference

930
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:23,730
yes I do want to know okay ethanol

931
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:43,119
yeah I I wanna I want to address this

932
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,710
because this is probably like the

933
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,149
elephant in the room I know I know I

934
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:50,350
always hold it well it's not even it

935
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:52,090
this is this effective on you know this

936
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:54,250
this affects add this effects the

937
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:56,199
potency as well so I I do want to

938
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,670
address the 800 year old question yeah

939
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:02,019
this is no this is it one of the biggest

940
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:04,180
questions that don't you so claps no no

941
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:05,769
yeah it only holds so much it's correct

942
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:09,340
I do want to explain this having these

943
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:12,970
headaches so the instrument errors are

944
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:14,589
under 1% alright the errors due to

945
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,170
repeatability in any of these methods

946
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:19,359
are actually under 5% the largest source

947
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,220
of error is actually from sample

948
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:22,899
collection and sample preparation

949
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,870
those are your largest source of error

950
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,550
so homogeneity is actually one of the

951
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:29,500
largest issues in this industry when you

952
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:30,819
see when you say that I sent four

953
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,769
different things to four different labs

954
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:34,839
and got four different results they're

955
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:36,519
probably all correct in that small

956
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:37,659
sample that you sent I think in this

957
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:40,180
industry we have a lack of understanding

958
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,279
on what's a representative sample of a

959
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,350
two-liter batch you're sending me one

960
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:45,819
mill of a 200-liter batch and you're

961
00:33:44,349 --> 00:33:47,919
expecting that to be representative of

962
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:48,700
that entire batch in other industries

963
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,680
don't do that

964
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:54,039
they take huge samples from massive

965
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,810
amounts yeah and and so if a lab tells

966
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:58,210
you that it was a calibration error

967
00:33:55,809 --> 00:34:00,460
that's actually patently incorrect your

968
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,019
calibration from week to week should not

969
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,370
drastically change a results that's the

970
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:04,599
whole point of those QC s well they

971
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:08,819
still reported it and then it was a

972
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:14,670
calibration and alcohols trash yeah yeah

973
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:14,670
any other questions yeah yeah please

974
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:53,470
to submit a simple the customer has to

975
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:55,509
demand it because then the brands will

976
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:56,709
start testing more they'll start getting

977
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,780
this data they'll start camera they'll

978
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,789
stop lab shopping it's the customer ass

979
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,860
as soon as the customer starts demanding

980
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:04,690
this information they want to know and

981
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,940
they will not buy the problem today

982
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,590
unless they do then everyone will play

983
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,420
ball I mean it simply said every other

984
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:13,240
industry has followed the same fad I

985
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:16,360
mean from alcohol is everything an

986
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:17,889
interesting one actually but right now I

987
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,900
was great when he was talking I was

988
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:20,618
thinking about alcohol and how did it go

989
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,880
for alcohol

990
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,320
what were those years what are those

991
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,269
years look like after alcohol was

992
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,990
regulated and the reason they went back

993
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:27,989
and opened it back up

994
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,290
you got to regulate this because people

995
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,389
are going blind so they went and fixed

996
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:35,559
that shit but how long if anyone in the

997
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:37,960
room knows can you how long did it take

998
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:40,119
ten years it took ten years of solid

999
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,639
figuring out and trying to figure out

1000
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:44,140
and at that point you had FDA labs

1001
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,809
everything else my issue with the

1002
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:49,118
doctors honestly there's honest doctors

1003
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:53,049
I see doctors who are like we need to do

1004
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,280
this yeah doctors need to stop sitting

1005
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,530
there in allowing pharmaceutical

1006
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,269
companies to control shit and once they

1007
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,890
stop doing that then they could be more

1008
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:01,480
fucking honest with the public and then

1009
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:03,489
we could say oh hey let's have a

1010
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,099
relationship but until then you know

1011
00:36:03,489 --> 00:36:08,199
where the public itself knows what's

1012
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:10,650
going on with pharmaceutical industry we

1013
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:13,868
know right down to the opiate epidemic

1014
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,490
that linked in with going to Iraq and

1015
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:17,470
taking fucking fields of opiates like

1016
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:18,759
like we're not stupid and and the

1017
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:20,679
doctors are the ones that prescribed it

1018
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,450
where are all the doctors now the

1019
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:26,858
doctors aren't getting in trouble the

1020
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:27,819
the pharmaceutical but it's like as far

1021
00:36:26,858 --> 00:36:29,319
as I'm concerned when it comes to

1022
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,420
doctors when they're asking these things

1023
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,010
they know how it works

1024
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,450
they already know how it works they're

1025
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,770
doctors they're dealing with the FDA

1026
00:36:34,449 --> 00:36:37,379
they're dealing with other shit so to

1027
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:39,610
turn towards cannabis and be like hey

1028
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:42,910
where's that where's the vist this and

1029
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:44,470
this how long did it take for alcohol ha

1030
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:46,420
I take for these other things we want it

1031
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:48,069
more than anything I I think that the

1032
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,170
labs wanted that people wanted everybody

1033
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,789
wants it it's just gonna take just like

1034
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:53,260
right now you're watching raids go on up

1035
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:55,869
in Northern California they're

1036
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,820
supposedly raiding guys that are not you

1037
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:59,440
know in compliance right I hear

1038
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,820
different stories but the fact that

1039
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,130
they're doing that and putting money

1040
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,660
into it it will change things next year

1041
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,910
and then they do and it will change the

1042
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:10,329
in it just takes that time but it's like

1043
00:37:06,909 --> 00:37:12,190
the doctors man like I don't even get me

1044
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:13,599
started getting getting back to you a

1045
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,190
little bit of what you were saying about

1046
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,199
how one would take to not be

1047
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:19,090
transactional that's gonna be like an

1048
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:21,219
industry psyche change like what he's

1049
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:23,500
saying we need to change it we right now

1050
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:25,000
it's it's impossible for lapse to lock

1051
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,159
down contracts that are longer than a

1052
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,619
few months I mean you need long-term

1053
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:32,440
contracts in in most other industries

1054
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:33,940
you have your long contracts and you you

1055
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,380
have this year-long contract with all

1056
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,210
these agreements with all these

1057
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,519
specifications and that's how you build

1058
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,380
that relationship and people need to

1059
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,360
understand that you have to build you

1060
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,039
know one of someone had asked me if I

1061
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,750
had a scientist on my side if I'm an

1062
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,250
extractor how would how would you

1063
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,260
account for like dealing with lab

1064
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:52,420
testing and I said the best way to do is

1065
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:55,330
in your process in your budget you have

1066
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:57,280
to budget in some level of failures and

1067
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:59,650
some level of errors this is going to be

1068
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,590
normal and you have to account for it to

1069
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:05,590
say that your tolerance is zero is a

1070
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:07,390
recipe for disaster as a business and so

1071
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,860
you have to account for it and then deal

1072
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:10,659
with it but right now in the industry

1073
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,190
this is not just true for the labs I

1074
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:13,899
feel like this is most supply chain

1075
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,340
relationships they need to be longer

1076
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,950
relationships people need to start

1077
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,570
demanding longer contracts and that's

1078
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:21,699
the only way you can actually build a

1079
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,750
relationship of trust because now you're

1080
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:24,429
locked in and you're like well I'm

1081
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,349
locked in might as well see how this

1082
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:28,929
works and how to improve each other

1083
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:30,460
along that process and I think that's

1084
00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:32,129
the best way because otherwise you

1085
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,150
follow other industries where you start

1086
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:36,280
standardizing how you make this stuff

1087
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,079
and that's also what helps analytical as

1088
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,810
other industries is that you know what

1089
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,460
you're testing is made probably by a B

1090
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:43,989
or C so you have a good idea of how to

1091
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,579
test it and that's why you require a

1092
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,109
long relations

1093
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:47,639
so you can get used to product you can

1094
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:50,730
start to understand how it works on your

1095
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:52,799
machines and how you extract it and what

1096
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:55,380
it means on your equipment on this day

1097
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,600
versus that throughput all that stuff

1098
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,400
matters in an analytical lab most

1099
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,710
analytical labs report ranges not

1100
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,119
numbers because it's because there's

1101
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,650
just if there's variability in this

1102
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,480
stuff I mean there's just so many things

1103
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,740
that are it makes so much more sense

1104
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,570
than other industries because they've

1105
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:12,029
already been there they've done it and

1106
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,980
it is a big ass of canvas to do it and

1107
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,840
your zero or three or five I mean I'm

1108
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,699
new to it all but it's gonna get there

1109
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,160
as long as everyone plays ball it

1110
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:21,599
doesn't try to circumvent what we're

1111
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,480
trying to accomplish with that said I

1112
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,849
really think that you know the labs need

1113
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,619
to be aware as somebody who's never like

1114
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:31,440
I said I've been every other in part of

1115
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:33,989
this industry every other division the

1116
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,809
thing that we live in is fear in real

1117
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:38,369
life as business owners we live in fear

1118
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:40,320
that tomorrow's not going to come right

1119
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:42,480
so these contracts will literally

1120
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,980
terrify us because we live on like a

1121
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,929
month-to-month in our minds and are

1122
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,869
barely coming out of this mentality of

1123
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:50,549
like I have enough to cover q1 I have

1124
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,230
enough to cover q2 right and we're

1125
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:54,180
getting out of this and so contractually

1126
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:56,099
binding ourselves to anybody has

1127
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:57,690
terrified us I mean let's talk back to

1128
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:59,519
just let you build that in though oh no

1129
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:01,110
I understand but in in in these

1130
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:02,550
businesses we're at a point like we were

1131
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,380
saying with the investments right we're

1132
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,570
at a place where we're we're we're

1133
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,579
making that that bridging that gap if

1134
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,110
you will as testing facilities and as

1135
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:11,789
people that are coming most of you most

1136
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,650
time from science and analytical world

1137
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:15,150
you guys have a very strong

1138
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,599
understanding of like the long game

1139
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,309
right

1140
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,869
you guys are long game people science

1141
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:21,059
are long game people that's what your

1142
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:23,009
job is right is to figure out next year

1143
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:25,380
that's what science is about we

1144
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:28,020
unfortunately as an industry we are just

1145
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,599
getting to the top right we're like

1146
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:32,159
right here and so I you know I encourage

1147
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,480
everyone this is kind of the end of our

1148
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:35,339
wrap-up I I encourage everyone to

1149
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,019
understand that these two worlds are

1150
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,360
kind of coming together and and the

1151
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:40,889
scientific world has existed in a way of

1152
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,930
regulation where when we ask questions

1153
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:44,639
like saman was a manufacturer is

1154
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:46,799
actually the question we've come into

1155
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,029
science from from cannabis right we've

1156
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,320
he's come into being like one of the

1157
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,530
smartest people I know in the world

1158
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,539
extraction through

1159
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,590
this passion and this mindset versus

1160
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:55,750
this long game

1161
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:57,700
you know Ivy League education look like

1162
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:01,239
how a lab is supposed to be run which is

1163
00:40:57,699 --> 00:41:03,369
a totally more evolved mindset

1164
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:04,989
professionally right and so what we need

1165
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:06,400
to do is we need to bridge that gap and

1166
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:07,959
that's what this whole conference was

1167
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,930
about was really bridging that gap

1168
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,159
between the scientists and the people in

1169
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:14,949
this industry and so I'd say this is a

1170
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,239
poignant example right here where we

1171
00:41:14,949 --> 00:41:17,649
have two completely different worlds

1172
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:19,629
need to come together and much better

1173
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:21,220
understand each other because they're

1174
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,480
right we do need long-term contracts

1175
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:23,919
there are a hundred percent correct and

1176
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,320
as somebody who has told every one of

1177
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,360
these guys no on a contract I will tell

1178
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,760
you that I am wrong I'm 100 percent

1179
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,230
wrong I need to sign contracts we all do

1180
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,480
because this is true this is how we

1181
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,889
create data data sets are not going to

1182
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,869
exist without our ability to create

1183
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:39,009
consistencies and you're only gonna do

1184
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:41,380
that if you're working with the same

1185
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,880
team over and over and over again so you

1186
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,170
can even see consistent how do you know

1187
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,610
how good you are if you jump around from

1188
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,619
lab to lab lab and everything is a

1189
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:49,360
little bit different everywhere you

1190
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:50,710
don't you find one person and you work

1191
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,539
with him at least for a long enough time

1192
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:55,990
to figure out what this is we actually

1193
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:58,059
created a meme today and it's our you my

1194
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:59,469
data and it's a little microchip and a

1195
00:41:58,059 --> 00:42:01,719
bunch of information off to the corner

1196
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:02,889
and he's like because realistically

1197
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,569
that's what this is all about is

1198
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:06,549
bringing all that data and bringing this

1199
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:08,170
to the culture of cannabis so we can

1200
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:09,880
make the to live together in harmony

1201
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:11,230
thank you guys for coming I'm so

1202
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,329
appreciative all of your time I think

1203
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:17,139
everything

1204
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:17,139
[Applause]
