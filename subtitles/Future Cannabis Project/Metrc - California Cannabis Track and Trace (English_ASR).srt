[Music]

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,000
metric is seed to sale tracking so the

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,080
concept of that is what it sounds like

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,410
that that every bit of cannabis in the

5
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:30,719
commercial cannabis chain supply chain

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,350
is going to be tracked from seed to sale

7
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:38,909
once that system is on-boarded that

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:43,109
means that when a seed is grown a clone

9
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:45,479
is made those start it with they get a

10
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:48,238
UID which is unique identifier they're

11
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,578
tagged at that level they get to be

12
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,609
tagged in lots of a hundred plants and

13
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,219
then there's a hundred tags reserved for

14
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,619
which of those plants make it into the

15
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,558
next line of the chain and from that

16
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:04,518
point that unique identifier is gonna

17
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:07,849
follow that product through the life of

18
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:11,280
through the life of that plant when it's

19
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:12,868
manufactured into a manufactured product

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,519
it's still going to be related to that

21
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:18,540
original UID when it moves to a

22
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:21,688
distributor they're gonna know which

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,900
batch which lot which unique identifier

24
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:26,868
is related to those products and when it

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,780
goes to retail and is sold to a consumer

26
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:34,200
we're going to know exactly that product

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,719
contains cannabis from this or these

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,579
plants if there's multiple plants that

29
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,548
are aggregated into a product those you

30
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:43,889
IDs are going to get combined and all of

31
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,500
that history will be captured in the

32
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,109
track and trace system every bit of

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,109
waste has to be documented in the system

34
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:54,118
every change of the disposition of a

35
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:57,930
plant has to be tracked in the system

36
00:01:54,118 --> 00:02:01,200
when it goes from clone too immature

37
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,990
plant to flower in plant to when it's

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,320
harvested - if it's disposed - if it's

39
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:09,209
manufactured any change of state those

40
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:13,318
are all checkpoints in track and trace

41
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:14,039
where it has to be logged so once people

42
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,098
are on

43
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:21,000
bordered on to the system the entire

44
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:23,578
history of every bit of cannabis and

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,068
every bit of product it becomes is gonna

46
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:28,230
be recorded in that system which is

47
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:33,750
pretty amazing when you think about it

48
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:37,649
but it's also a monumental task to to

49
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:40,769
get all of that information in there and

50
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,099
that's where a lot of money questions of

51
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:46,680
how this process is really gonna work

52
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:50,280
come up because we have this difficulty

53
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,099
now of you have operators operating

54
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,949
under a temporary license with the

55
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:58,138
temporary license you're not able to get

56
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:00,658
on to track and trace yet only with the

57
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,879
issuance of annual licenses would an

58
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:05,068
operator get to take the training for

59
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:09,108
track and trace and then they have 30

60
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:11,548
days to onboard all of their impress

61
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:13,349
product into track and trace you have

62
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,060
this 30 day period of time where you're

63
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:17,128
gonna do a massive inventory and you

64
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,500
have to represent everything that you

65
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:21,259
have in track and trace after that 30

66
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,900
day period

67
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:27,298
everything starts with seed after that

68
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,419
like you do not get to bring in any

69
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:33,449
in-progress products at that point that

70
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,159
aren't represented in the system the

71
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:37,530
challenge that we're going to have is

72
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,948
you're gonna have different operators at

73
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,389
different places on the supply chain

74
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:45,900
getting their annual license at

75
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,699
different times so how the huge

76
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,359
challenge that the agencies are facing

77
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:53,010
is how do you onboard everybody at the

78
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,949
same time because if not you're gonna

79
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:58,198
have a cultivator who isn't on track and

80
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:01,139
trace still using their temporary

81
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,780
license and giving paper manifests and

82
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,519
documentation to a manufacturer who is

83
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,609
on track and trace who's gonna have to

84
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,959
input all that stuff into their system

85
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:11,579
creating it within the track and trace

86
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,919
system who may be selling to a

87
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:15,540
distributor who may or may not be on

88
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,150
track and trace so then they couldn't

89
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:20,219
complete the electronic transfer of that

90
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,408
system and then that distributor could

91
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,659
sell those products to multiple

92
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:27,000
retailers who may or may not be on track

93
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:27,469
and trace yet so so that I think is

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,660
going to be

95
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,900
one of the huge challenges of onboarding

96
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:36,320
is how are they going to complete the

97
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:38,269
life cycle of these products in track

98
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,389
and trace when there's inconsistent

99
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:44,109
adoption of it and I don't know how

100
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:47,180
that's going to be rectified unless they

101
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,879
put everybody on even with temporary

102
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,709
licenses to get all of the products in

103
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:54,110
there so that you can have a consistent

104
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:56,779
supply chain on track and trace or they

105
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:59,090
wait on the issuance of annual licenses

106
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:01,399
until you have a real critical mass of

107
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:03,829
license types that represent enough of

108
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:06,109
the supply chain to have everybody on

109
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:07,550
board in that same 30-day period of time

110
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,670
but I think that's going to be one of

111
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:14,569
the big challenges that we see is how

112
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:16,939
that onboarding works and what how I

113
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:19,040
mean what the liabilities are whose

114
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:20,540
responsibility it's going to be to input

115
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,730
that information when you're working

116
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,650
with some people on the system and some

117
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:27,169
people who aren't on the system what a

118
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:31,009
lot of people may not be aware of is

119
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:34,519
that even before track and trace becomes

120
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:36,409
active as an operator you are still

121
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:39,079
required to fulfill all of the

122
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,050
record-keeping requirements of what will

123
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,359
be on track and trace so those

124
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,569
record-keeping requirements are really

125
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,020
extensive even before track and trace

126
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:53,360
the shipping manifest has already been

127
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:55,009
published by the CDFA and other agencies

128
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,020
to say here's the shipping manifest you

129
00:05:55,009 --> 00:06:02,209
should be using when you're transferring

130
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:04,459
product between licensees I mean those

131
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:06,709
if you think about when you look at the

132
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:08,569
record-keeping requirements for for

133
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:10,459
track and trace it does say that at a

134
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:14,120
minimum you have to be keeping these

135
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:16,609
things on on paper on invoices Matt you

136
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,379
know that you can have a spreadsheet but

137
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,960
you have to have your records maintained

138
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:23,089
in some way that you could give them to

139
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,189
the agencies upon request either in

140
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:27,589
hardcopy or electronic form is the way

141
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:30,228
they put it in the regulations so so

142
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:32,509
pretty much if you think about every one

143
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:34,728
of those checkpoints where you're

144
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,889
supposed to be doing you know

145
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,899
reconciliations event physical inventory

146
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:40,769
every 14 days you're supposed to have

147
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,959
really detailed information

148
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:45,628
on any sales invoice when you're

149
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,689
transferring before between licensees

150
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:51,120
you're supposed to be keeping contracts

151
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:53,728
with your distributors on file you're

152
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,709
supposed to have you know really

153
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:58,079
detailed inventory records in terms of

154
00:06:55,709 --> 00:07:00,658
there's there's columns of here's the

155
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:04,198
information that kind of constitutes an

156
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:06,899
inventory and what I've been working

157
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,550
with a lot of people on is going over

158
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:11,098
those record-keeping requirements

159
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,658
because you know much like with the

160
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,459
transitional period and everybody

161
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:17,908
feeling shocked and surprised by the

162
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:20,399
packaging requirements when that day

163
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:22,709
hits and they issue your annual license

164
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,658
and a clock starts ticking and you have

165
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:27,089
five days to complete the training and

166
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:30,269
then 30 days to onboard all of your

167
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:32,939
products and to track and trace those

168
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:35,430
record-keeping requirements are in

169
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:39,209
effect so if you don't have that

170
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:43,129
information to to onboard your products

171
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:46,109
you're gonna be in this huge crush of

172
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:48,840
having to suddenly create systems and

173
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,819
protocols and checkpoints and keeping of

174
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,098
records and where did you where do you

175
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,590
weigh it and training your staff into in

176
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:58,228
terms of all of these different moments

177
00:07:55,589 --> 00:08:01,948
of transition and if if you as an

178
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:04,139
operator haven't set up that you know

179
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:07,110
culture of compliance and system of

180
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:10,009
record-keeping yet it's gonna derail a

181
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,300
lot of businesses and in right now

182
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:14,580
there's a little bit of wiggle room you

183
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,430
know with keeping your paper records

184
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:20,639
with how long you have to reconcile your

185
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:23,908
inventory do you have a little bit more

186
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,699
flex when that is being logged in a

187
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:30,120
government system that is going to

188
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:32,158
reflect every single time that your

189
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,879
inventory doesn't line up every single

190
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:37,889
time that the weight isn't right it has

191
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,889
requirements of reconciliations for

192
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:43,918
different business types every 24 hours

193
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:47,039
every you know so many days notification

194
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:49,230
requirements because that's when it is

195
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,958
critical that you have developed these

196
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,509
processes and have already enough of a

197
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,099
handle on how to keep these records

198
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:58,169
and how to make sure that you're

199
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,509
ensuring the accuracy of the information

200
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:03,719
that you're inputting so that your

201
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:05,669
business can continue to run because

202
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,080
there's different states they handle at

203
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:09,000
different ways in some states when

204
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,009
you're track and trace goes off and it's

205
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,169
not if it's not synched up with your

206
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,330
physical inventory or your POS system

207
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:17,129
your system shuts down like if you and

208
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,580
you can't transfer anything until you

209
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:22,169
reconcile where did this go and and

210
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,670
that's one of the systems too is you

211
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:26,219
can't just say oh I don't know where it

212
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:30,029
went we we lost the pound of weed I have

213
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:34,320
no idea like you have to be able to you

214
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:38,459
have to be able to explain everything

215
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,250
that happens and and I would think that

216
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,740
most operators in the cannabis space in

217
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:47,539
California are not used to that level of

218
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,799
rigor and oversight on every single

219
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:51,870
activity and every single thing that

220
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,609
happens and it's gonna be a learning

221
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,289
experience for the agencies as well

222
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,700
because that you know they're I don't

223
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:59,039
know if they know out of a hundred

224
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,810
clones how many really get lost and how

225
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,659
much waste is created and how much

226
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:05,459
weight shifts between states and you

227
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,219
lose water weight at this point and I

228
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:11,310
think that we're going to see a lot of

229
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:14,129
changes you know with taxation with you

230
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:16,949
know what's expected in terms of how

231
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:18,929
products transform and how the supply

232
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,930
chain really works but that stuff's

233
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:23,789
gonna take time and unfortunately you

234
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:25,500
know the early licensees and the early

235
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,569
adopters are gonna be the guinea pigs in

236
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,909
that process of creating the data that

237
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:32,550
they need to see how this system really

238
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:37,199
works so it seems like if you were

239
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:40,469
walking into a brand's office or a

240
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,379
dispensary and they haven't started

241
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,840
anything would basically be like you

242
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:49,620
know have a point person who's gonna be

243
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,420
like your metric guru yeah

244
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,769
don't have it be one person because of

245
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,909
they leave your company then you're

246
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:55,860
screwed

247
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:57,750
yeah have multiple people but like

248
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,440
basically it's gonna be a full time or

249
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:04,500
like half day job for somebody if I was

250
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,690
to be working with their consulting with

251
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,879
a brand that has

252
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,530
of this ready or thinks they have some

253
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:14,250
of it ready and maybe it doesn't line up

254
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:16,049
all the way I mean some of the first

255
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,429
things to do there's there's a there's a

256
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,839
part in the regulations that I say

257
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:21,419
should always strike fear into any

258
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,970
licensees heart which is that more or

259
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:26,159
less to paraphrase the the actions

260
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,920
omissions or failures of any employee

261
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,949
are taken as the actions omissions of

262
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:36,599
failures of the licensee themself so

263
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:39,870
that is the huge justification in case

264
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,550
for employee training and for why it is

265
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:46,500
so important that your entire staff

266
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:50,339
understands the the necessity and

267
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,200
consequences of this culture of

268
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,850
compliance that start I mean compliance

269
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,590
is like the big buzzword right now in

270
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,500
terms of cannabis because it's that it's

271
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:00,210
what makes the engine run it's such a

272
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,039
we're entering into I mean we're not

273
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:07,170
entering we're here into such a

274
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:10,740
regulated environment that this this

275
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:14,339
aspect of record-keeping or inventory

276
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,720
management is not one person's job we're

277
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,399
used to say well I'll have it is my

278
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,620
inventory manager and that's his job and

279
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,889
its and its really it becomes

280
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:26,039
everybody's job because so much of the

281
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:28,710
activities that used to be you know

282
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,480
completely acceptable you know at the

283
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,759
retail level for example it's totally

284
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,820
normal in so many cases for for a

285
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,439
budtender to say oh well we're out of

286
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,000
this product so I'm just gonna sell it

287
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,800
as this product because here it is in

288
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,500
the POS and it is the same amount and I

289
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,209
can't find this where that becomes

290
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:49,110
utterly unacceptable at this point

291
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:51,089
because if you have you know your your

292
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,060
software data that goes out of sync with

293
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:57,480
your physical inventory that goes out of

294
00:12:54,059 --> 00:13:00,029
sync with your track and trace those are

295
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,800
really difficult reconciliations to

296
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,620
backtrack and figure out what happened

297
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,109
and that's like some of what everybody's

298
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,970
awakening to is that now suddenly a lot

299
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,919
of people you go from maintaining one

300
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,779
inventory or two that was your physical

301
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,088
and from inventory and what's in your

302
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:17,639
POS to now you have three different

303
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:19,560
inventories that you're trying to keep

304
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,309
in sync at all times which is the

305
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,278
physical

306
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:26,009
taury your POS or erp whatever you're

307
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,750
using your in-house system and then the

308
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:30,600
track and trace system and all of those

309
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:33,389
have to match and all of those have to

310
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,159
be reconciled on a daily basis and

311
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:36,210
you're not you don't want them to get

312
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:38,370
too out of sync

313
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,200
and there's a lot of challenges because

314
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,850
there's a lot of POS companies that are

315
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,230
saying like you'll never have to log in

316
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,000
to track and trace and we'll handle

317
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,700
everything and we'll just do it all and

318
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,289
in one of the things you you're gonna

319
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,270
want to log into track and trace

320
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:54,480
occasionally because you don't want to

321
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:56,970
discover two weeks later when you do

322
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,009
your 14-day reconciliation that things

323
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,350
have gone out of sync and then you got

324
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:03,569
to be a forensic archaeologist to figure

325
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,580
out what happened you know and go back

326
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:10,770
and and reconcile each of those

327
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:15,600
instances of where did this Graham go so

328
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:17,159
those aspects of and and I will see for

329
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,250
a lot of operators it really helps to

330
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:22,699
bring in a compliance person or to have

331
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:25,649
somebody come and kind of drive home

332
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:28,680
that this is not just some crazy stuff

333
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,929
that the bosses are making up to make

334
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:34,588
your job horrible and to make you do a

335
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:38,579
lot of extra work it's a real necessity

336
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:40,800
and I think some of the you know the

337
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,800
creativity and opportunity of this

338
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:46,889
moment is to figure out how do you use

339
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:50,250
these requirements of the regulation to

340
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:52,199
actually help to improve and inform your

341
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,850
business and give you better data and

342
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,860
give you the ability to make better

343
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,519
business decisions and give you the

344
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,930
ability to you know feel more

345
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,419
comfortable and confident with your

346
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:06,169
staff because you there's been a lot of

347
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:08,610
operators who have fear of theft and in

348
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:12,059
diversion and other issues where this

349
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:15,060
just kind of introduces a lot more kind

350
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:17,879
of checks and balances to help everybody

351
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:20,159
to to do their job and to help to

352
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:24,240
maintain inventories in a more cohesive

353
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:29,639
way but it is but I think that there is

354
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,820
no under estimating how big this onus of

355
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,819
record-keeping is when you

356
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,960
look at the regulations across the

357
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:40,730
different agencies and see how many

358
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,769
instances there are of where that

359
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,420
record-keeping obligation is and how

360
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:46,399
many things are supposed to be keeping

361
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:49,370
all ready and that you have to maintain

362
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,970
all these records for seven years you

363
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,840
know that this becomes an enormous part

364
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,750
of your business

365
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:59,530
is how you're going to maintain these

366
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,120
records make sure that they're accurate

367
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:03,980
like it's the responsibility of the

368
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,679
operators to enter accurate information

369
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,300
into track and trace and make sure your

370
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,819
employees are entering accurate

371
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:14,959
information in the track and trace and

372
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:17,090
and just again that that obligation of

373
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,610
that record-keeping doesn't start with

374
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:22,430
track and trace it started back in

375
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,440
January the employee training is going

376
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:26,059
to be a huge part but in order to train

377
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,780
those employees you're gonna have to

378
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:33,259
have some really clear SOPs protocols

379
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:36,259
best practices I call it I'm a big

380
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:38,659
checklist geek so I call it like flight

381
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:41,629
checklists like for any activity as

382
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:44,779
simple as it seems there should be a

383
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:49,039
checklist to help your employees to help

384
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:51,439
the managers go did you do X Y &amp; Z you

385
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,269
know when you're conducting a sale did

386
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,400
you get this information when you're

387
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:57,230
receiving a product did you check and

388
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,750
log all of these things when we're

389
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,399
transferring a product did we do all of

390
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,529
this when you're when you're beer a

391
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,389
cultivator and the plant is changing

392
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:07,309
state did you log all of this

393
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:11,060
information did you issue the right

394
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:12,740
certificates did you you know log the

395
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:15,938
things in the correct place and then

396
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:19,338
update track and trace accordingly

397
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:21,589
there's so many discreet check points

398
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:25,009
for these things like I have so many

399
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:28,039
chocolates because every activity that

400
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:30,559
you do as an operator you know it kind

401
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:34,309
of has these emergency flight checklists

402
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,599
of if you don't do these five things you

403
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:38,629
know we're gonna have some critical

404
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,879
errors down the road and and some of

405
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,620
that stuff I always think with like with

406
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,120
checklist with pilots it's not to be

407
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:45,329
insulting to be like you don't know how

408
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:47,219
to fly a plane so

409
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:51,019
you have to use this checklist it's

410
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,460
because in these in the most mundane

411
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:55,380
activities is kind of where we go dead

412
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,090
sometimes and we think we know these

413
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,220
things and we think we do them by rote

414
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:01,678
or we think I know this person I don't

415
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,558
have to check their ID or whatever it is

416
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:08,100
that there's kind of the more support

417
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:11,970
you can give people by just having these

418
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:14,389
you know easy-peasy little a few step

419
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,589
checklist to make sure that those

420
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:20,820
critical points are being handled

421
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:23,038
correctly is is really important and

422
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:25,439
then and then some of it is just knowing

423
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,569
the regulations because I think that

424
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,690
something still there's so many of them

425
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:33,240
they change you know we just got a new

426
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,730
set of emergency rags we're gonna get

427
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,970
the language of the full regulations and

428
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:41,490
to really understand and go through them

429
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:44,339
to see what those record-keeping

430
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:46,319
requirements are and I also think it's

431
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:48,509
critical for operators to know that not

432
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,788
all of the regulations that impact their

433
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:53,278
business are in the cannabis regulations

434
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:55,558
the cannabis regulations reference many

435
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:57,630
other regulations and you have to know

436
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:59,819
what's in those and what record-keeping

437
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,880
requirements or other requirements may

438
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:05,788
be contained in these other you know

439
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,919
codes and public resource things that

440
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:10,048
affect your business and then just the

441
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,000
normal stuff I mean the normal stuff of

442
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:14,158
any business because I think that's

443
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,929
where you know for a lot of the

444
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:18,440
operators in this space it's a whole new

445
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:21,538
world of suddenly you go from having

446
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,399
volunteers at your collective to now

447
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:25,230
you're a commercial cannabis business

448
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:27,689
you have to contend with all of these

449
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:31,519
regulations you have to contend with all

450
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:34,350
of the HR and labor code regulations of

451
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:37,528
California which isn't easy you have to

452
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:39,629
contend with OSHA you have to get like

453
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:43,740
any of these things that impact any

454
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:46,320
business are now the onus of any

455
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:51,380
cannabis operator regardless of the size

456
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,379
of your business so what percentage

457
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:59,420
brands retailers and cultivators do you

458
00:19:55,069 --> 00:20:01,909
think have made significant progress on

459
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:05,630
their understanding and implementation

460
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:10,880
of best practices related to track and

461
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:15,800
race I'm not sure how many California

462
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:20,690
operators are prepared for the reality

463
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:23,690
of track and trace State there's some

464
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:26,320
brands in California that that have come

465
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:31,309
to California from other states that are

466
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:34,149
kind of fully adept and conscious of you

467
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:37,099
know the requirements of that system

468
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:39,050
so I think they they come with a very

469
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:43,429
different perspective but that's a small

470
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:45,049
percentage of operators for what you

471
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:48,890
call it like the legacy operators of

472
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:50,960
California who have been you know in the

473
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,570
collective model for a long time or

474
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,190
cultivating kind of outside of the

475
00:20:53,569 --> 00:21:01,250
regulated system for a long time it's

476
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,710
it's the ones that I'm working with it's

477
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:08,240
a real rude awakening in many ways to

478
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:10,910
suddenly see just how many things that

479
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,240
they have to do and in some ways it's a

480
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:16,880
real disruption to you know their

481
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,920
natural organic processes that they have

482
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,450
a way that they've been doing things for

483
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:27,710
decades at this point and and that that

484
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:29,539
I mean that's why I try to tell people

485
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:32,329
as much as possible when I'm working

486
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:34,940
with them like to start practicing these

487
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:37,220
new requirements these checkpoints these

488
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,019
where you have to weigh things and when

489
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,779
you have to report things and when you

490
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:44,599
have to notify the agencies of certain

491
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:47,480
things to start practicing that as much

492
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:51,159
as possible before track and trace kicks

493
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:54,380
in because just when track and trace

494
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:58,660
when it's active the stakes are higher

495
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:01,880
the the logging is more permanent and

496
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,740
it's harder to backtrack it's harder to

497
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,920
change things at that point

498
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:09,980
and and that you're kind of on this this

499
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,620
real ticking clock at that point so it's

500
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,599
not as easy to test new systems and

501
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:16,369
adapt and be like oh well let's try it

502
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,740
this way or maybe this person would be

503
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:20,929
the best to do it like all of those

504
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,089
changes after track and trace require

505
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,830
notifications to the agency of whose

506
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:27,379
your track and trace manager and like

507
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:31,809
you can't just make those pivots as

508
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:35,750
swiftly or organically as you could now

509
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:38,029
so I think that you know as much as

510
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:40,250
possible for the operators to really

511
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:42,769
start practicing that as much as

512
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:46,130
possible before they get their annual

513
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:49,339
license and and that happens is really

514
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:52,040
critical I mean I couldn't venture a

515
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:54,379
percentage of booze who's ready but I do

516
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:57,710
think I do think you're gonna see a lot

517
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,780
of changes in you you know for POS

518
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,750
companies you know what they're

519
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:04,099
advertising points are cuz right now

520
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:07,369
there's been a lot of stuff that's about

521
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:09,169
like user experience and you know that

522
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:12,409
it's cool for this or it looks really

523
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:14,420
good on the iPad or how it manages you

524
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:17,240
know front facing inventory but I do

525
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:19,630
think a big shift you're gonna see with

526
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,519
with the release of track and trace is

527
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:26,330
what the selling points are for POS

528
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:28,730
systems and that people yeah and making

529
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:30,529
sure people understand what compliant

530
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,440
means with it with a track and trace

531
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:36,440
system I mean with the POS system many

532
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,299
POS systems will say you know oh we're

533
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,039
approved we have the API for track and

534
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:42,289
trace we interact with track and trace

535
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:44,690
but what they mean is it at the end of

536
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:47,000
the day you can download an Excel

537
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:50,450
spreadsheet and you can physically

538
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,970
rearrange the columns and upload it to

539
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,980
track and trace yourself and that 90% of

540
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,269
the time it's gonna fail and then you're

541
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,610
gonna sit there in the middle of the

542
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:00,950
night you know ticking clock you have 24

543
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:03,349
hours to upload your information for the

544
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,420
day and you're gonna freak out and and

545
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:06,949
and try to get it to talk to track and

546
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,830
trace and maybe there'll be errors and

547
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:12,640
maybe they won't so so the POS systems

548
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:16,009
that are gonna have an actual true

549
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,630
automated real-time update of track and

550
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:20,629
trace are going to be

551
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,920
referable in some ways but I've still

552
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,690
seen operators who are like we'll do I

553
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,340
want real-time because what if it makes

554
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:29,660
a mistake and then I have to fix it and

555
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:32,839
it's like understanding like it's it's

556
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:35,630
like it's it's like operating inside of

557
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:37,220
an x-ray machine like anything you do

558
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,870
that's a mistake they're gonna see

559
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,539
they're gonna see it's gonna be logged

560
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:43,519
and it's okay to make mistakes in some

561
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:46,069
ways there's there's a process for doing

562
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:49,039
it but you just have to report

563
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:51,439
everything and if you're making 50

564
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,680
mistakes a day then that's not gonna

565
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:59,890
look good on the system so so that's why

566
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:03,860
there's gonna be this real demand for

567
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:07,400
precision and accuracy and you know

568
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:09,019
inventory management and those aspects

569
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,330
are gonna become critical in the

570
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:13,519
operation of businesses which is I think

571
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:16,009
just for a lot of the operators in

572
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,139
California like I said a level of rigor

573
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:21,829
that they are not used to one of the

574
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:25,340
realities that operators should be aware

575
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:27,889
of is that even now the agencies could

576
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:29,929
come and at audit your records to say

577
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:33,380
you should have been keeping paper

578
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:35,990
records of every transfer every receipt

579
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,600
of product from a licensed from a

580
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,849
licensee all of your contracts with

581
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:42,259
distribution with license distributions

582
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:44,179
that all should have been happening

583
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:45,920
since January so they're anticipating

584
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,750
that you've got all these paper

585
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,060
documents for every record-keeping

586
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,220
requirement that's that sitting in your

587
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:53,960
cabinet that they could at their

588
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,339
discretion come and say like hey let's

589
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,110
check out where did this product come

590
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:59,899
from where's your shipping manifest to

591
00:25:57,109 --> 00:26:02,389
which licensed you know manufacturer

592
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:08,350
provided this product like they could do

593
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:11,570
that when your annual licenses issued

594
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:13,849
you have five days to do the track and

595
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:16,309
trace training and then you have 30 days

596
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:18,319
to onboard all of your product during

597
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:20,179
that 30 days you still have to be

598
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,099
keeping all of your records on product

599
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:26,480
that's coming in and out but that's just

600
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:29,419
a time span that you have to represent

601
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,950
in the track and trace system every

602
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,590
single prod

603
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,990
that you have at whatever level of

604
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:38,538
production it's at so if you're a

605
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,460
cultivator you're inputting how many

606
00:26:38,538 --> 00:26:42,619
immature plants do you have what's in

607
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,840
your canopy right now what's drying and

608
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:49,009
harvest that you got 30 days to put it

609
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:51,619
all in after that 30 days you can't put

610
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:53,750
any more in progress you can't go back

611
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:56,479
and be like oh I found you know a

612
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,740
hundred more clones we forgot about over

613
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,470
here and we want to put them in the

614
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,509
system now actually that's a bad example

615
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,829
because clones technically you can put

616
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:06,379
them in from the clone level but you

617
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:07,759
can't be found like a mature plants and

618
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,850
her like actually there's more can see

619
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,648
than we thought then you can't bring

620
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:14,808
them into the system at that point after

621
00:27:12,648 --> 00:27:17,658
those 30 days anything that wasn't

622
00:27:14,808 --> 00:27:20,839
represented in your system starts at a

623
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:22,639
seed or a clone and then and then you

624
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,168
follow it through the system so we're

625
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:26,689
gonna have a bunch of on-boarded

626
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:29,960
products that'll be in progress so you

627
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:33,080
may be a distributor at that point

628
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,298
that's receiving an already made product

629
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:38,898
from a manufacturer that got on-boarded

630
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:41,269
into track and trace up until definitely

631
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:45,408
July first is there were no permanently

632
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:47,179
our annual licenses but now as I sew I

633
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:50,960
get my license I get my annual license

634
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:55,519
on July 1st up until now I just have to

635
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:58,759
keep records here at some point and so

636
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:01,638
this is my question at what point and is

637
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:04,879
it 30 days after I get my annual license

638
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:08,658
do I proactively have to get on a

639
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,510
computer and enter data and submit it

640
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:16,278
into the government metric system versus

641
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:19,970
just keeping it on set yeah ok so once

642
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:22,099
you get your annual license and you have

643
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:25,278
that 30 days to onboard your product

644
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:28,278
from that point on everything that

645
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:30,169
happens is communicated to the

646
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:33,230
government agencies through track and

647
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:35,630
trace that every activity that you

648
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,589
participate in anything you receive

649
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,710
anything you said

650
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:41,778
anything you do anything internal

651
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:43,069
everything is recorded into track and

652
00:28:41,778 --> 00:28:44,990
trace and there and for different

653
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:49,099
operators there's a different timeline

654
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:53,859
of how long you have from the time of

655
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:56,418
the activity to notify the system in in

656
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:59,209
in track and trace and that can be

657
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:01,850
anywhere from 24 hours for certain

658
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:05,929
activities to three days for certain

659
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:07,730
activities that that you have these

660
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:10,759
timelines that are established in the

661
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:12,980
regulations of from the moment this

662
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:15,470
thing happens you have this long to

663
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,569
report it in track and trace and if

664
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,640
those activities go out of sync and

665
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:22,308
things are not represented in track and

666
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:24,890
trace where suddenly a mature plant

667
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:27,470
appears that wasn't tracked from clone

668
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,538
or suddenly a manufactured product

669
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:34,579
appears that doesn't isn't connected to

670
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:37,278
a UID from from a seed or a clone you

671
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:40,849
have a problem because everything from

672
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:42,440
that point on once once people are on

673
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:44,869
track and trace and those products are

674
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,390
being tracked from seed to sale it has

675
00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:50,629
an entire history that's embedded into

676
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:53,270
its its unique identifiers and it's

677
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:55,399
gonna get a lot harder to bring in

678
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:58,369
products that are not part of the

679
00:29:55,398 --> 00:30:00,408
license system because it will because

680
00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:02,028
there will be no way for it to be

681
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:04,580
inserted into those systems without

682
00:30:02,028 --> 00:30:09,440
those identifiers that after that

683
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:12,819
onboarding period start at seed so two

684
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,899
takeaway for me is once you've on

685
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:17,418
boarded and you're in kind of your

686
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:20,839
steady-state operating mode you'll

687
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:24,259
pretty much be almost daily entering

688
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:26,778
system and entering data into the metric

689
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:30,679
system and hitting the submit button and

690
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:33,200
that data is gonna go from your computer

691
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,149
to the government servers and they will

692
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,278
now have access to your information and

693
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:40,609
if you get lazy on that there will be

694
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:42,960
consequences like you can't fall behind

695
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:48,509
on that

696
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:51,670
yeah from the time that operators

697
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:54,190
complete that onboarding on to metric on

698
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:58,810
to track and trace I mean there's gonna

699
00:30:54,190 --> 00:31:01,960
be a new job at your facility which is

700
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:05,289
your track and trace manager you know

701
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,509
somebody has that job and and it's in

702
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:10,450
the regulations that you have to select

703
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:13,059
somebody to fulfill that role and that

704
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:16,529
they are you know fulfilling the

705
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:19,059
obligation of monitoring all of these

706
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:20,740
requirements and everything that has to

707
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:21,819
be entered and then the syste and in

708
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,529
fulfilling one of the things too is

709
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:25,329
fulfilling system notifications the

710
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:26,829
trick is not just you telling the track

711
00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:28,659
and trace system they're gonna tell you

712
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:30,250
stuff too and if you get a notification

713
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,160
from the track and trace they're gonna

714
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:34,809
say how long you have to respond to

715
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,820
whatever the request was and whatever

716
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,740
the notification is from track and trace

717
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:41,049
and that's something that that person

718
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:45,339
has to stay on top of and I think that

719
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:48,359
that's a new reality that that very few

720
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:53,439
people are prepared for in California of

721
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:55,990
having this relationship with this you

722
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,559
know direct channel to the state

723
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:02,890
government who's going to be monitoring

724
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:07,539
every activity that every operator in

725
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:10,509
the cannabis chain conducts so if I am a

726
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:13,269
track and trace manager in Washington

727
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:19,450
State or Colorado I'd probably have a

728
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:21,009
lot of job offers today yeah I would

729
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:25,509
imagine I would imagine that we're gonna

730
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:27,640
see a lot of a lot of hot job market for

731
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:30,190
people in other states you have a lot of

732
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,110
experience dealing with track and trace

733
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,509
who are those track and trace account

734
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:36,490
managers from other states for

735
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:39,579
businesses that have not been you know

736
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:41,920
audited failed or penalize are gonna

737
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:44,019
become kind of like hot properties for

738
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,740
California of really wanting to tap

739
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:49,720
people who have the expertise of dealing

740
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:53,859
with these systems and who really

741
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,120
understand the demands and the scope and

742
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:57,759
the rigor of

743
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:00,819
what it is to communicate and keep these

744
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:06,900
systems synched with your your physical

745
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:10,509
operations one of the one of the biggest

746
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:12,820
shortcomings I've found in all of the

747
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:14,680
audits that I do and all of the ongoing

748
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:17,289
compliance work that I do with people is

749
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,840
this record-keeping piece where I think

750
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:22,029
that it mean it's very difficult I have

751
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,439
a great deal of empathy for operators in

752
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:25,299
terms of the fact that it's it's

753
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,920
impossible to comply with every single

754
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:27,399
regulation that's put out there right

755
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,769
now

756
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:33,960
and and I think that they move through

757
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:36,069
them you know in in you know

758
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,350
prioritizing them in a certain way and

759
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:40,509
some of the stuff that operators have to

760
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,949
do is just to survive to pay their bills

761
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:43,629
at this point and to make sure that

762
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:47,380
their businesses don't collapse and go

763
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:49,690
under while they're trying to deal with

764
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:52,840
all the costs of becoming a compliant

765
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:55,330
operation and that in that this piece

766
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:58,419
the the record-keeping piece is kind of

767
00:33:55,329 --> 00:34:01,058
so far down the line of what's

768
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,550
forward-facing for your business they're

769
00:34:01,058 --> 00:34:06,730
like ah I know yeah I mean that it

770
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:08,860
doesn't it doesn't you know hold up much

771
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:12,969
water for them right now but I think

772
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:16,059
that that profoundly changes as the

773
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:20,259
specter of track and trace in metric

774
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:22,418
come closer because you start to review

775
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,530
okay well when I go in to track a trace

776
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:27,279
what a minute what is it that I'm

777
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:30,460
putting in there and then you see how

778
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,679
many points of contact there are and how

779
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:35,019
many representations there has to be in

780
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,530
that system and how necessary it is that

781
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:40,840
there's nothing I mean that the product

782
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:43,750
can't move from location to location

783
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:46,240
with a distributor without going into

784
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,099
metric and doing a shipping manifest and

785
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:51,009
receiving that shipping manifest in

786
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:52,329
metric so my understanding is even POS

787
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,310
companies that are like you'll never

788
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:56,168
have to touch metric it's not true

789
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:58,799
because you have to go in there for

790
00:34:56,168 --> 00:35:00,789
certain activities such as the

791
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,310
descending and receipt of the shipping

792
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:06,029
manifests for any transfer or product so

793
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:09,960
and it's in part of it too is

794
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:12,090
you know like I keep saying is that the

795
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,860
the big trick is to figure out how to

796
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:19,079
not make the this process for cannabis

797
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,880
operators just a horrible experience of

798
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:24,599
stuff that's happening to them to be

799
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,450
like Oh God and to actually you know

800
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:29,579
really confront these things really dig

801
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:32,569
into these regulations and see how you

802
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:35,639
can make them serve your business

803
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:39,180
because because few people would argue

804
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:41,579
that having super accurate inventory is

805
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:43,919
a terrible thing for a business so and

806
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:46,949
then when you see it that way and see

807
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,960
that that's all really that that is the

808
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:53,250
function of track and trace is to make

809
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,769
sure that everything stays in the supply

810
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,539
chain and that you're not losing product

811
00:35:55,769 --> 00:36:00,150
and that your employees aren't stealing

812
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:01,529
from you and that you know if something

813
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,420
is going terribly wrong and you're

814
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:06,630
losing a huge percentage of your plant

815
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:10,019
what's happening like that it gives you

816
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:12,119
these opportunities to to you know be a

817
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:14,070
business and see like how can I improve

818
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:18,900
my efficiency and how can I make this

819
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:21,240
system work and in and then that way you

820
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,980
know it's not that scary I mean you know

821
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,049
the scariest thing about metric is that

822
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,480
it's kind of like looks like software

823
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:30,030
from the 90s I think that's gonna say

824
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,610
words like it would be nice if it was

825
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:35,820
like a little more you know 2.0 we'll

826
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:39,329
see so it's kind of like telling my

827
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:41,880
three-year-old daughter yeah there's a

828
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:43,920
positive in this which is you'll be big

829
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,320
strong and healthy yeah definitely

830
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:51,539
definitely metric insight into your

831
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,180
inventory to what's selling what's not

832
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:55,949
selling yeah I think the cannabis

833
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:59,309
industry is definitely having an eat

834
00:36:55,949 --> 00:37:03,199
your vegetables moment that's like you

835
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:06,659
know this is this is how the industry

836
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:09,389
the licensed industry the regulated

837
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:11,909
industry distinguishes itself from an

838
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:16,109
illicit market is all of these things

839
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:17,359
that feel horrible in some ways are

840
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:20,090
absolutely not

841
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:23,059
Cerie it is absolutely necessary that we

842
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:25,150
have rigorous testing of products it is

843
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:28,279
absolutely necessary that we fulfill

844
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:31,130
packaging and labeling requirements what

845
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,860
those are can be changed and adapted and

846
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:37,519
evolved you know to hopefully have less

847
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:39,289
impact on the environment and but it is

848
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:42,199
absolutely necessary that we have

849
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:45,139
standards for for this industry and it's

850
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:49,399
absolutely necessary you know and in

851
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:52,159
effect we're we're part of a crazy

852
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,260
paradigm shift we're part of a change in

853
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,389
cultural consciousness about the

854
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:59,540
attitudes towards cannabis and the

855
00:37:56,389 --> 00:38:03,469
attitudes towards a lot of different

856
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:07,519
kinds of things in in part of our job as

857
00:38:03,469 --> 00:38:10,339
the cannabis industry is to help people

858
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:14,389
confront their fears and to help

859
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:16,970
eliminate those perceptions of what they

860
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:19,519
think the market is so it's you know

861
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:22,129
it's tough times for us to have to go

862
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:24,619
through it and be so over regulated in

863
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:28,190
and rigorous about things but what we

864
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:30,589
get to do in that process is demonstrate

865
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:33,800
that this is a business like other

866
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:36,230
businesses and and it's not some crazy

867
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,180
free-for-all where every operator is

868
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:41,000
feeding the illicit market and we're all

869
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:43,069
doing they say you know by onboarding

870
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,260
onto track and trace by showing the life

871
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:48,140
of a product by show like helping to

872
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:50,450
educate the agencies and the government

873
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:52,909
in terms of how this stuff really works

874
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:55,129
that's the ways that we actually

875
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:58,279
influence the policy in the direction of

876
00:38:55,130 --> 00:39:01,849
the industry and help to relax some of

877
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:07,400
those unfounded fears and some founded

878
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:10,000
fears about how this industry can be

879
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,000
wrangled

880
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,260
and

881
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:24,500
