1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,799
you've had you know some of the bigger

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:06,119
companies start to think about where

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,919
they want to be in a couple of years for

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,469
a long time was how quickly we have

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,689
licenses in eight ten twelve fifteen

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:14,759
markets so a lot of the companies

7
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,198
weren't necessarily you know really

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,339
thinking about exactly where they wanted

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,050
to be it wasn't the other way you think

10
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:21,420
about traditional retail location

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,010
location it was much more can we get a

12
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,230
license in the state can we represent to

13
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,720
the investors that we have licenses and

14
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,609
you know four or five regulated states

15
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,649
than four or five of the states that are

16
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,289
a little bit easier to the secured

17
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:35,729
license in that's that's starting to

18
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:37,170
change you know we definitely were

19
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:38,578
watching guys that just said I want

20
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,100
plant as many flags on the ground as

21
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,649
possible now you're watching the the

22
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,480
same CEO say okay we're already in X

23
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,920
amount of states now we really want to

24
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,449
identify you know what are the best

25
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,820
places to be within that state do we

26
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,710
want to you know be in some small town

27
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,270
with the small populations just to say

28
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,859
we're there or we really want to go

29
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,660
after a marquee location and say you

30
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,179
know we're in downtown Los Angeles or in

31
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,648
New York City or in Chicago so a lot of

32
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:03,390
the multi-state operators now are really

33
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,338
focused on finding the right asset

34
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,439
because they realize it like at non

35
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:08,849
producing asset it gives them you know

36
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,109
some sort of exposure to say we're in

37
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:12,030
that state but it doesn't really do all

38
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:15,569
that much their bottom line and as we're

39
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,009
evolving away now from blue sky and

40
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:18,629
really going back towards fundamentals

41
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,950
it's just much more important for these

42
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:21,989
guys to have something that they can

43
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,640
tell the investor class like yeah we

44
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:25,199
actually think that the trajectory here

45
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,390
is going to be able to allow us to grow

46
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,189
into what our market cap is today our

47
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,900
most operators getting back to

48
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:33,688
fundamentals because it seems like a lot

49
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,520
are still paying premiums and trying to

50
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:38,368
get marquee assets

51
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:41,250
I think of Fifth Avenue locations and

52
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:42,899
right yeah those guys are definitely

53
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,250
overpaying for assets still I think

54
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,899
they're going to continue to overpay for

55
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,978
assets as long as they have investors

56
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,680
that are willing to overpay for their

57
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,269
paper so you know I look at the

58
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,740
competition for deal flow right now and

59
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:53,849
there's only so many really marquee

60
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,789
names out there so that when you

61
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:58,019
actually have a business that's for sale

62
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,700
that's actually a really good business

63
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:01,289
that you'd like to own there might be

64
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,570
four or five suitors and that's

65
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,920
especially true or was especially true

66
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:07,228
as these guys are going into the RTO

67
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,750
process which is that the reverse

68
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,489
takeover process in Canada and they're

69
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,500
trying to say okay before we actually go

70
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:14,210
out there and go on our road

71
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,830
we try to raise you know 100 million

72
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,750
dollars we want to make sure we've got

73
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,400
as much to show the investor base as

74
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,710
possible so if it means that you know we

75
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,469
raised around before the RTO that we use

76
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:26,930
specifically to deploy into you know

77
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:28,490
buying a couple assets those are the

78
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,170
ones that are you know really hotly

79
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,540
contested from from a deal flow

80
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:34,759
perspective but now these guys have you

81
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:37,009
know a different currency and we talked

82
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,780
a little bit this last time we spoke

83
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:41,689
where it's a combination of using their

84
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,969
paper and using cash as well to secure

85
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:46,129
transaction you know now they're they're

86
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:47,509
being a bit more careful about how

87
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,799
they're structuring their deal but know

88
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:50,620
they're still they're still overpaying

89
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,270
for the asset from the standpoint of

90
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,520
what multiple you'd attach to a business

91
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,020
but they also look after the perspective

92
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,000
of you know if it's an oleg a

93
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,140
police-style state you know meaning that

94
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,580
there's only a certain amount of license

95
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,689
that's given out and those licenses have

96
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,719
already been given out which means

97
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:07,039
there's no no more left to give then

98
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,780
they'd rather go into those states and

99
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,329
say okay if we can secure it now and

100
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,189
hope that you know states can expand for

101
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,770
away from just being a medicinal market

102
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:17,449
so let's let's use Illinois as an

103
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,120
example it's you know a really a good

104
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:23,719
example that under a rauner the the

105
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,769
governor rauner the market didn't expand

106
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,859
all that much but then all of a sudden

107
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:29,959
you know you had the opioid bill that

108
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,209
allowed the patient population to double

109
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,620
and now under JB Pritzker coming into

110
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,209
office very likely you're gonna see

111
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,090
adult youths recreation happen in the

112
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,680
next year so if you had the opportunity

113
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,840
to buy a license let's call it in last

114
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,099
year with a small patient population you

115
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,239
might have overpaid for it but you

116
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,979
didn't overpay for it for what the

117
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,680
market is going to be you overpaid for

118
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:50,179
it for what the market was so in those

119
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,920
states like the New York's the Florida's

120
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,090
the Illinois it's questionable but we'll

121
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,229
know in four years whether or not they

122
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,450
were paid for the asset they certainly

123
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:02,859
overpaid for it by it what the the

124
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,859
revenue was of those companies today
