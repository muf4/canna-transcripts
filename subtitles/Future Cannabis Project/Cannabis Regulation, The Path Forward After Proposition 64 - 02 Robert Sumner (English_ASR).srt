1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
[Music]

2
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:17,599
uh yes good morning Robert suar with the

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,240
California Department of Justice I'm

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,278
happy to be here this morning uh in

5
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:23,320
front of these uh three committees I

6
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,198
think it'll be uh a really great panel

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,198
throughout the morning uh I'll keep my

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,279
portion brief uh and largely uh to the

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,399
role of the Attorney General as uh the

10
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,878
Constitutional chief law officer for the

11
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:39,679
State uh both the medical uh marijuana

12
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:41,960
legislation that was passed and prop 64

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,920
actually largely omits a direct role for

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,799
the Department of Justice uh aside from

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,320
our administrative Duty and in uh

16
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,000
disseminating criminal history

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,359
information uh that said uh as I go

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,238
through a basic overview of the bill

19
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,600
you'll see that as the uh lawyer for

20
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:59,320
virtually every uh government entity in

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,640
the state the Attorney General will be

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,239
continuing to to assess the impact that

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,239
prop 64 and the legislation proceeding

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,799
is going to have on our day-to-day

25
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,239
responsibilities through our various

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,240
legal divisions and sections uh we've

27
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,158
actually appointed a coordinator within

28
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,399
our government law section an attorney

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,479
whose sole uh purpose on this project is

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,000
going to be to assess the cumulative

31
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,359
impact of these new policies for

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,200
marijuana uh on the department to

33
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,478
understand whether or not we have

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,280
appropriate resources to handle all the

35
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,319
complex legal issues and Regulatory

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,840
Frameworks that are going to be

37
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,438
implemented as as a result of the law um

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,399
in addition to that we also are going to

39
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,199
be actively using our case management

40
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,359
system to track any litigation that

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,118
comes to the various sections that have

42
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:45,599
a core nucleus uh subject of cannabis or

43
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,959
marijuana legalization uh in order to

44
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,118
track the progression of those issues uh

45
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:52,438
as a quick overview I believe the

46
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:55,239
background paper does a fairly good uh

47
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,879
summary of the props 6or language but I

48
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:58,920
can just give a refresher it's that it

49
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,920
makes cannabis lawful under state and

50
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,200
local law for adults 21 and older uh

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,920
they can possess up to 1 ounce of

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,759
marijuana for personal use and cultivate

53
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,000
up to six plants for personal use in a

54
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,840
private locked residence it can only be

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,639
smoked and Vaped in places where tobacco

56
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,719
is allowed and it can't be ingested in a

57
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,799
public place uh from there it's prop 64

58
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,039
is largely based on the previous medical

59
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,400
legislation that was Champaign by

60
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,359
members of this committee and the

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,080
legislature uh in that it divides up a

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,840
number of very complicated uh and

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,440
necessary uh

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,519
regulatory uh framework pieces

65
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,560
across different areas of agency

66
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,239
expertise uh of course the one newly

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,680
created entity within the past few years

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,840
was the Bureau of medical cannabis

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,760
regulation uh which is going to be

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,120
handling uh The lure for uh the

71
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,439
transport distribution sale and I

72
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,480
believe will be testing um that is a a

73
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,840
new Bureau that as an entity of the

74
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,518
Department of Consumer Affairs will be a

75
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,920
client agency of our licensing section

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,360
and then meanwhile the food and

77
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,039
agriculture department is going to be

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,920
licensing the cultivation which which is

79
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,798
a client of our natural resources

80
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,000
section Department of Public Health

81
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,080
health will be licensing uh

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,719
manufacturing and that is a client of

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,879
our health education and Welfare section

84
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,400
uh from there uh those kind of key

85
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:17,479
implementers that are obviously working

86
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,319
on a tight timeline to implement

87
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:22,919
regulation uh there will be a number of

88
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,039
other impacted agencies or legal issues

89
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,919
that may come to Light Within the

90
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,798
Attorney General's office uh the State

91
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,518
Board of Equalization will obviously be

92
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,159
in charge of uh collecting the special

93
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,480
tax is implemented by prop 64 which is a

94
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,479
client of our business and tax section

95
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,158
another client of that section is the

96
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,560
treasurer who is of course working on a

97
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,280
number of issues related to uh dealing

98
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,438
with the profits uh related to uh

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,438
marijuana sales um the various

100
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:51,000
environmental uh regulations that are

101
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:52,639
going to be Set uh by uh food and

102
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,158
agriculture as well as state Water

103
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,958
Resources control board and the

104
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,639
department of pesticides it's a kind of

105
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,878
our natural resources section uh and

106
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,958
then on top of that you know we expect

107
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,560
that there will be a number of reduced

108
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,199
penalties as a result to prop 64 which

109
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,840
allows for marijuana felonies to be

110
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,719
reduced to misdemeanors with petitions

111
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,400
for reduced charges and so our appeals

112
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:15,280
rits and trial Section which handles

113
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,199
many of those cases will likely be

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,759
dealing with those issues as well as our

115
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,960
Correctional law section uh from there

116
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,759
as far as our employment administrative

117
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,039
mandate section uh prop 64 continues to

118
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,038
allow employers to discriminate against

119
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,639
users of marijuana and that may come up

120
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:33,360
as well as uh in settings of

121
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,199
professional licensure which is one of

122
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,680
the primary uh B&amp;P committee issues uh

123
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,840
both our Health Quality enforcement

124
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,199
section which deals with the Healing

125
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,159
Arts boards and our licensing section

126
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,038
which deals with many of the other

127
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,560
boards may end up uh seeing litigation

128
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:49,959
involving uh disciplinary or lure

129
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,399
revocation cases uh where one of the

130
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:55,000
factors uh behind the investigation was

131
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:58,478
use of marijuana uh to the extent that

132
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,478
local ordinances restrict uh cultivation

133
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,839
or use of marijuana in a zoning context

134
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:05,240
we have a land law section that would

135
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,560
deal with that prop 64 also envisions

136
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,800
the possibility of nonprofit lenses and

137
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,000
that would fall under our charitable

138
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,800
trust section it's it got to a point

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,399
when we were assessing this that as we

140
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,840
go through all of those issues which

141
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:20,719
unfold through uh the language of prop

142
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,318
64 uh nearly every legal section within

143
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,919
the Department of Justice is likely

144
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,800
going to have some case or some matter

145
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:29,519
that involves uh a new issue that has

146
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,038
been brought to light by the ass signing

147
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:35,159
of the initiative um as I mentioned

148
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,439
earlier we do also have a direct role in

149
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,720
that we are the state's criminal history

150
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:44,160
depository so to the extent that prop 64

151
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:48,080
and previous legislation continues to uh

152
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,000
uh lay out fitness criteria for lenses

153
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,399
with uh the idea that they cannot have

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,120
been convicted of a substantially

155
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,959
related crime or serious or violent

156
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,959
felony uh felonies inv involving uh

157
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:02,120
fraud and deceit or employment of a

158
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:04,478
minor in uh a drug drug business uh all

159
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,399
of that uh background check workload

160
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,839
will be coming to our arious division of

161
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,038
the California Justice Information

162
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,519
Services Division uh and then finally uh

163
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,879
I would also point out that as far as

164
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:16,000
the driving impaired issue uh there is

165
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,719
obviously going to be a lot of

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,240
discussion about what constitutes

167
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,160
driving impaired uh following the uh the

168
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,879
ingestion ingestion of marijuana uh

169
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,639
we're looking at all the new scientific

170
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:29,759
ways to be able to do roadside testing

171
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,400
and other types of testing uh by law

172
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,439
enforcement and that's something that

173
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,079
the various folks that work in

174
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:35,839
toxicology and our Bureau of forensic

175
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:39,959
Services is likely going to have to

176
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:41,918
handle from uh a it workload issue um

177
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,598
finally to the extent that uh law

178
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,279
enforcement training and standards

179
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:46,598
impact us as chief law enforcement

180
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,559
officer I'm sure we'll be working

181
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:51,199
closely with the various associations

182
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,120
and with post and CHP uh to make sure

183
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,319
that we are adequately preparing uh

184
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,519
folks that are doing local law

185
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,439
enforcement and Statewide law

186
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,839
enforcement uh for the new laws that

187
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:03,319
will be a large change in life for many

188
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,359
of them uh and then just to book end

189
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,800
with this if there is any case just

190
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,840
generally challenging the

191
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,800
constitutionality of either proposition

192
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:15,239
64 any of its Provisions any of the

193
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,598
regulations uh or any local ordinance uh

194
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,800
that will obviously fall upon the

195
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:21,759
Attorney General to defend as the chief

196
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,000
law officer for the state so uh while we

197
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,439
don't have a direct impact of result of

198
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,360
prop 64 uh you almost get uh a little

199
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,000
annotation next to every provision in

200
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,680
the the law where the Attorney General

201
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,160
will likely have to be present to lend

202
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,879
some legal guidance so uh in that

203
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,560
serving as kind of a basic and and

204
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,080
hopefully brief summary of the

205
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,639
provisions of the bill and how we see

206
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,240
them from our role at the AG's office uh

207
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,079
I'm I'm happy to answer any questions Mr

208
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,960
suner let me just ask you just something

209
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:52,758
real quick and I know Miss walren also

210
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:55,198
has a question but you know under under

211
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,759
the proposition it specifically names

212
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,598
you know Department of Consumer Affairs

213
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,598
Department of Public Health and the car

214
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:02,279
California Department of F and a to come

215
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:03,639
up with a regulatory scheme workor I'm

216
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,119
just wondering how is the Department of

217
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,720
Justice working with those three

218
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,319
agencies and what's the regulatory

219
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,000
framework that the Department of Justice

220
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,520
is doing is that independent is it

221
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,639
collaborative is it we're going to wait

222
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,279
and see what the feds do they've been

223
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,918
invited by the way they didn't show up

224
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,679
thank you for being here but can you

225
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:25,478
give us some sense of that

226
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,959
please uh sure uh we're not directly

227
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:29,639
involved with any of the the regulation

228
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,680
uh that is currently being developed by

229
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,680
the other departments um certainly we

230
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,879
have uh an open conversation and an open

231
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,478
dialogue with with the bureau with the

232
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:41,759
Departments uh with their uh parent

233
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,240
agencies uh largely as legal counsel uh

234
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,360
we have uh active client Liaisons that

235
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,320
are always available uh to work through

236
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,480
various uh legal issues but uh really

237
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,240
the the proposition sets out that the

238
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,720
stakeholders with the expertise should

239
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:01,680
be developing uh the specific policies

240
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,480
and regulations uh uh for what fits with

241
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,319
their own jurisdictions uh the

242
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,200
Department of Justice and there's you

243
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,360
know a portion in there uh you know kind

244
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,000
of clarifying and accelerating some work

245
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,800
that we've been doing uh to assess the

246
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,958
legality of hemp cultivation uh like I

247
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,078
said the the background check process is

248
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:22,039
something that we do already uh for

249
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:24,239
lenses of all kinds throughout the state

250
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:26,439
and we'll be continuing that workload uh

251
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,000
with what's in the proposition but

252
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,800
otherwise uh we really have been less an

253
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,120
indep dependent implementer of this uh

254
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:36,838
new initiative and more so uh legal

255
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,600
councel for those who are tasked with

256
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,800
doing the job so it's obviously it's a

257
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,200
it's a complicated issue and we're

258
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,399
always available to them for that so let

259
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,040
me ask you legally for the State of

260
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,120
California as we continue to move

261
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,759
forward and given the federal landscape

262
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,440
and the new Administration what are some

263
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:57,278
of the things we should be uh concerned

264
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,399
with right uh well I mean what's

265
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,879
important to keep in mind is that in

266
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,720
terms of federal versus state law not a

267
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,120
whole lot has changed at the federal

268
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,200
level what we've seen over uh the past

269
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,200
several years isn't a change in federal

270
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,000
law but the expression of different

271
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,440
enforcement priorities on behalf of the

272
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,039
US Department of Justice uh we don't

273
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,240
speak in terms of a federal statute or

274
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,078
or regulation we speak in terms of

275
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,360
memoranda issued by uh the Federal

276
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,000
Department of Justice we had uh you know

277
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,360
we'll talk about the Ogden memorandum

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,440
which was then replaced by the Cole

279
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,240
memorandum then there was a supplemental

280
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,839
Wilkinson memorandum all of these are of

281
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,159
course uh subject to uh the pleasure of

282
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,480
the United States Attorney General uh

283
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,199
but at this time uh there's you know

284
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,800
really nothing but speculation that can

285
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,720
be done for how the federal government

286
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,240
is going to choose to view its own

287
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,440
enforcement priorities obviously you

288
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,680
know we've been hearing a lot about uh

289
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,399
the issue uh from California as we look

290
00:10:54,679 --> 00:11:00,120
to implement our own uh state laws that

291
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,440
would seem to conflict with fed law

292
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,959
that's why it's important to state that

293
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,320
it's not that marijuana is legal it's

294
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:10,000
that it is lawful under our laws uh but

295
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:13,160
while that is a new legal uh context the

296
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,440
the core issues of federalism and the

297
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,879
right of states to enact their own

298
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,120
policies that may or may not be

299
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:21,360
preempted uh by federal law is something

300
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,839
that is uh kind of at the core

301
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,278
Foundation corre of most government law

302
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,800
so uh you know we've been evaluating

303
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:33,120
that issue across a whole Spectrum

304
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:36,278
of areas uh of conflict between uh

305
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,560
Federal priorities and California's uh

306
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,039
policies and we'll be continuing to do

307
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,479
that as we get a little bit more meat to

308
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,799
what we're currently thinking we might

309
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,120
be seeing out of the Federal Department

310
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,838
of Justice yeah so as a Department

311
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,959
California Department of Justice are we

312
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,279
gearing up to have that argument of

313
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:54,239
state's rights and looking for

314
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:56,200
litigation not just in this area but

315
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,759
like you said there's a host of

316
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,120
areas um where this could potentially be

317
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,319
an issue

318
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,159
right well obviously you know we have a

319
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,959
new attorney general who uh knew from

320
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,159
his first day in the office that one of

321
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:12,759
his core functions was going to be

322
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:15,278
assessing when where how uh and uh how

323
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:17,399
most vigorously to defend the priorities

324
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,320
of the State uh it's a constitutional

325
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,078
mandate uh for the attorney general and

326
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,680
uh it's going to become a question in in

327
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:26,638
many court settings I don't want to get

328
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,719
too far out in front of but I think

329
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,000
certainly it is understood and uh the

330
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,320
analysis is already happening to

331
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,519
constantly look into issues of what

332
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,079
defenses was calfor would California

333
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,799
have in order to preserve its own

334
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:44,479
policies uh that its own uh citizens

335
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:48,240
have chosen to act on uh despite any

336
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,480
sort of uh Federal uh conflict got it

337
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,959
thank you Miss

338
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,320
wal thank you Mr chair um you know with

339
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:59,399
this implementation we can clearly see

340
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,160
it's a a balancing act um and with the

341
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,320
California Supreme Court affirming local

342
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,399
authority over medical Canabis um to

343
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,879
some extent and you know as was

344
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,759
mentioned the patchwork of local

345
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,519
ordinances trying to give clear

346
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,838
direction to law enforcement the

347
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:20,440
employment issues brought up um land use

348
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:23,639
planning as well as um just the state

349
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,040
being consistent Statewide as well um

350
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,320
having served over 14 years in local

351
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,519
government you know I'm I'm concerned

352
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,160
and I was just wonder wondering how

353
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,278
would your office and the other

354
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:36,838
stakeholder agencies that you're working

355
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:40,000
with how do you look to balance local

356
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,040
control with the Statewide concerns and

357
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,799
what would be you know how do you look

358
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:48,039
at defining the Statewide concerns that

359
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:49,799
would bring some consistency that is

360
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:52,519
needed while still preserving some of

361
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,039
the local control and I know it's a real

362
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,120
Balancing

363
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:58,480
Act uh and I mean obviously the the

364
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,839
issue of you know to what extent should

365
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,920
locals be able to govern for themselves

366
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,480
uh how marijuana should be lawful in

367
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:07,360
their communities is something that's

368
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,079
been present uh throughout uh a long

369
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,919
history on this subject and and I do

370
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:13,958
believe that uh both the uh the medical

371
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,159
legislation that was passed and also

372
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,958
what's mimicked in prop 64 does

373
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,360
recognize the importance of local voice

374
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:23,239
on many of these issues um I'll say that

375
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,800
having worked on this issue back in 2011

376
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,720
when we were evaluating if any

377
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,479
additional guidelines were needed in lie

378
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,120
of new uh statutory policies uh there

379
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,680
was almost nothing speaking to this

380
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,480
subject about what could or could not be

381
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,559
regulated at the local level so what

382
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,120
we're seeing now I think is a much more

383
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,799
memorialized commitment to understanding

384
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,720
that there should be a balance between

385
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,240
what standards the state thinks is

386
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,320
appropriate to set out through its

387
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,159
expertise through its departments and

388
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,519
also what is uniquely uh necessary for a

389
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:54,120
local community um and that's something

390
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,078
that I I know that all of the the key

391
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,360
Regulators uh have in mind and that

392
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,519
they're working actively with local

393
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,480
stakeholders and that's something that

394
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,959
the Attorney General General would

395
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,320
certainly encourage thank you thank you

396
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,758
let me ask if there are any more

397
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,879
questions all Mr wood has one and then

398
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:10,320
we'll go to Mr Brook super brief has

399
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,078
there been Outreach from our attorney

400
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,240
general's office to the federal attorney

401
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,000
general's office to get any sort of a

402
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,399
idea of what direction they're going or

403
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,519
is it premature uh it's premature but

404
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:26,278
more so for for me to say that there's

405
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,720
really any uh kind of uh direct

406
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:29,919
conversation happening with the federal

407
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,399
government now in terms of they're not

408
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,679
even really being a confirmed uh federal

409
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,278
attorney general at this time so uh

410
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,278
certainly you know state and federal

411
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:40,559
Partnerships are important but it's all

412
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:41,639
going to be handled uh In Due Time by

413
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,838
those that are going to be working on

414
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,440
any actual uh legal uh

415
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,800
forums but is it safe to say in the past

416
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,639
we had regular conversations with the

417
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,919
federal government on this issue or to

418
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,680
an extent yes uh I mean obviously uh the

419
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,278
US attorneys that uh represent the the

420
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,758
Federal Department of Justice when in

421
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:03,958
California have always had good

422
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,079
relationships uh both locally and with

423
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:08,719
the state law enforcement Liaisons that

424
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,479
work with them are are prosecutors uh

425
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,519
within the state AG's office uh

426
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,440
frequently engage with the federal uh

427
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,000
level and I don't expect that to change

428
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,040
substantially with the new federal

429
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,720
Administration uh that said when you do

430
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:22,278
talk about the potential for conflict it

431
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,920
becomes a slightly different posture uh

432
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:26,039
where uh obviously the the federal level

433
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:27,599
department of justice and the state

434
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:29,078
level department of justice are going to

435
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,839
be making sure that they're preserving

436
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:33,958
their own best interests if there is any

437
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,639
uh sort of Court setting for those

438
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,958
conversations thank you great Mr bro

439
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,519
please thank you Mr chairman the other

440
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,958
uh conflict between state and federal

441
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,198
government is the banking laws um is

442
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:49,278
your office involved with the

443
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:51,198
treasurers um working group or um you

444
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,759
know a lot of us in my view I think we

445
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:57,278
need to get out of the you know physical

446
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,800
commodity of cash needs to be something

447
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:03,000
uh electronic like Bitcoin or something

448
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:04,639
because we can't have um businesses

449
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,599
delivering hundreds of thousands of

450
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,720
dollars of cash to a Boe office and

451
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:13,159

456
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,679

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,199
has been raised from a couple of

458
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,640
