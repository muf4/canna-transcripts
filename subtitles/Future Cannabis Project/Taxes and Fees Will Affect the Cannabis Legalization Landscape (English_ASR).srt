26
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,640
a lot of what's been happening across

27
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,239

40
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,759
the state just so you know I'm used to

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,439
working up there I've been appointed by

42
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,000
three governors at one time or another I

43
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,038
was a legislative judge for the great

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,959
button will lawsuit that lasted the

45
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,840
environmental lawsuit radioactive

46
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,478
lawsuit that lasted seven years I just

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,959
spent a year doing the economic impact

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,680
study for the highspeed rail I spent a

49
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,199
year and a half doing the agriculture

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,280
impact study for the State of California

51
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:19,199
on value added I work on ESG

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,159
environmental and social and governments

53
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,399
projects all over the world I'm in India

54
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:27,159
right now and in Africa so I really go

55
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,159
all over this is the only grus job that

56
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,598
I'm doing and I I felt cuz somebody got

57
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,159
to pay the bill but I felt this was

58
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:37,280
important that I be not paid by anybody

59
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,000
try to keep as much bias out of it as

60
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,959
possible so today instead of giving you

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,959
answers I hope that I really present

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,680
with you the questions that are needed

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,878
because what you heard up here was a lot

64
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,879
of effort has been done but there are

65
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,719
some big voids and some big questions

66
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:56,799
that I think that are natural I was a

67
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,800
County supervisor for 20 years I was a

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,439
president of the California uh State

69
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,920
Association of counties so I come from

70
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,639
local government so I understand them

71
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,598
and I served on the kelper board for

72
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,079
seven years I was the appointee by

73
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:10,399
Schwarz Ander and brown so I understand

74
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,480
the state and I understand local

75
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,120
government and I am a 44 years a farmer

76
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,280
of many products so with that going to

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,719
get to the script we'll go all the way

78
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,318
through then if you have we have time

79
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:24,239
for

80
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:25,639
questions so I want to sincerely thank

81
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,680

Minds to me this past two and a half

88
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,360
years of research I've been introduced

89
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,400
to every part of the indust industry

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,239
spoke with hundreds of people and in

91
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,360

data out there I can honestly tell you

95
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,079

97
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,400

100
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,599

101
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,429
especially thank Susan sories of care

102
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:12,679
for all the

103
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,719
[Applause]

104
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,358
introductions because without her I've

105
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,079
never been able to meet many of you in

106
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,279
the room and I I literally have been up

107
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,960
and down this state and no one has ever

108
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,879
turned us away to talk to us in a

109
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,359
research in a confidential way and some

110
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,719
of you that listened to the radio talk

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,720
show we did a couple weeks ago we were

112
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,280
pretty open about about that discussion

113
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,080
I've attended Humbolt and their work

114
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:40,439
I've been at Fresno County when they uh

115
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,918
ruled the growing of cannabis outside

116
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:43,399
that I know those Board of Supervisors

117
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,839
since I was one and I sat in the

118
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,879
audience that day and listening listen

119
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:51,079
to the lack of

120
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,319
reasoning um and keep in mind that

121
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:55,279
you're going to hear in this is that

122
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,279
it's without bias if it should be or not

123
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,119
be because that's my job but there are

124
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,239
some built-in biases and I I will Point

125
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,959
those out

126
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,639
as I began my observations today I want

127
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:06,758
to preface it by stating that I have

128
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:11,519
read the current iterations of ab 243

129
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:13,919
266 and 643 SB and yet as a market

130
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,758
Economist I stand by the challenges and

131
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,918
threats that I see that will impede a

132
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,520
free market environment and that will

133
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,079
cause some degree of market failure

134
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:26,399
going forward my observations are not

135
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:28,879
just focused on the approach compromises

136
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,239
appeasements Andor interpretation of the

137
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:35,000
metal marijuana law and administration

138
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,960
thereof but rather an all-encompassing

139
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,160
Marketplace that will exist if and when

140
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,680
recreational Cannabis is approved by the

141
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,240
voters of California because it's all

142
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,360
tied

143
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,120
together I also want to make it clear

144
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,960
that even though I may disagree with

145
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,079
some of the actions taken and or

146
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:51,879
proposed I do strongly acknowledge the

147
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,198
efforts of so many trying to do what

148
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,879
they think is right for the industry and

149
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,199
the communities of California let us

150
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,680
always acknowledge that the fact and

151
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,120
it's a fact fact I've always reminded

152
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,959
people at the state level

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,560
Californians 100% of Californians those

154
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:10,399
of you living sitting in this audience

155
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,240
at the end of the day live in local

156
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,918
governments no one lives in the state we

157
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,000
live in local governments and therefore

158
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:19,639
the vested interest by local governments

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,839
is the heart and soul of California we

160
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,199
need to recognize that our communities

161
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,439
are

162
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,960
important I also want to confirm I am

163
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:31,079
not part of the Cannabis industry or I

164
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,279
have I ever been compensated at any time

165
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,879
or in any way by any entity in the last

166
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,359
2 and a half years for my research my

167
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,598
comments today come from a diverse

168
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,160
background of being a farmer a professor

169
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:45,120
of economics and public policy and is a

170
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,800
25-year veteran of government Service as

171
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,680
a practice an economist and public

172
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,478
policy practitioner I typically do

173
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,560
research in a way to try and limit

174
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:57,598
bias uh rather and rather report what it

175
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,000
seems to be the facts or strong opinions

176
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:02,038
about a particular subject by those

177
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,680
within this industry or those of the

178
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:05,959
oversight of the industry and what you

179
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,000
heard today was just a touch of and

180
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,758
those that of you were part of the

181
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,720
industry more than any other agriculture

182
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,960
crop and we have 450 of them in Fresno

183
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,919
Fresno County alone in the Central

184
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:21,279
Valley that this is a very complex

185
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:22,680
industry my research into the California

186
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,719
cannabis and the prospects of full

187
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,160
legalization had taking me on a physical

188
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,680
research trip all across California and

189
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,639
a virtual research journey across the US

190
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,598
around the globe I've exerted the utmost

191
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,199
effort to limit bias in my work but as a

192
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,878
farmer of a number of crops for over 40

193
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,000
years as a past CEO of one of the

194
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,919
world's largest multinational specialty

195
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,800
companies out of London and as a

196
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:49,560
California local elected government

197
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,840
official for 20 years I have built in

198
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,000
firsthand knowledge of both growing and

199
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:58,318
governance and as the president of

200
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,240
seesac I can tell you how many times we

201
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,120
did lived with the unintended

202
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,360
consequences of both referendums and

203
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,399
legislation given my background I am

204
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,400
going to present information embedded in

205
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,959
academic Theory and research today but I

206
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:17,000
will also step out beyond that and give

207
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:19,478
some personal opinions of unintended

208
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,120
consequences or threats that possibly

209
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:23,918
are on the path of the journey to a new

210
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,199
and modified medical marijuana Market

211
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:29,560
Andor for recreational use in

212
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,639
California I also want to point out that

213
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,759
we should never forget that canab

214
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:38,080
cannabis begins as an agriculture

215
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:40,639
product and therefore shares all the

216
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,519
risk and challenges of a growing crop

217
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,480
and like all Farmers cannabis Growers

218
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,399
are price takers and therefore subject

219
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,120
to real and artificial changes of supply

220
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,120
and demand in the

221
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,958
market and one of the things that I've

222
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,720
noticed in this legislation there are

223
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:00,159
some

224
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,440
artificial uh barricades the way it is

225
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,919
right now maybe they'll work that out

226
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,240
and I'll touch a little bit on that in a

227
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:07,078
free market Society a competitive market

228
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,320
is composed of many buyers and sellers

229
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:12,359
of goods that a fairly unrestrained to

230
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,600
trade on products and services and

231
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,759
negotiate an ultimate market price that

232
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,278
reaches what we call equilibrium we all

233
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,360
know basic

234
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:23,958
economics what we as consumers are

235
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,720
willing to pay and what Growers need uh

236
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:29,000
in order to make a profit or at least

237
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,000
break even

238
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,560
this is where the buyer and seller reach

239
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:35,879
the satisfactory level of consumers the

240
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,518
buyers considered to be a fair price and

241
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,720
they have the willingness and ability to

242
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,039
pay for what producers Growers need to

243
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,560
cover their cost hopefully that is

244
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:48,159
profitable the real question here is how

245
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:51,039
free and competitive can the California

246
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:53,159
Economist Market truly be given the

247
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,879
possible restraints of Interstate

248
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,958
because right now it's Interstate within

249
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:01,000
the confines of the State of

250
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:03,679
California and Poss be no Interstate

251
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,039
consumers across the US even though we

252
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,559
know part of the production currently

253
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,480
goes

254
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,119
Interstate the current proposed

255
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,039
legislation changes will satisfy the

256
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,240
concerns as many at the state and local

257
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,039
levels but a number of changes will

258
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,159
impede any chance to have a fair and

259
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,519
competitive

260
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,399
Marketplace as Government imposes more

261
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,560
and more restrictions in the marketplace

262
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,639
it will cause distortions to what the

263
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,199
ultimate supply and demand equilibrium

264
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,720
might be and is further distorted if the

265
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,959
grower is disallowed to be competitive

266
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,320
by lack of

267
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:40,078
diversification or use of vertical

268
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,320
efficiencies which we talked about

269
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:45,958
earlier in my opinion as it is proposed

270
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,399
by some right now the new California

271
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,638
medical marijuana stands to be

272
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,440
restrained by lack of vertical

273
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,278
integration of the grower Market power

274
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,519
may be prevalent by those that have the

275
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,679
power of distribution the market will be

276
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,759
oversupplied by new producers and

277
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,679
potential

278
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,559
offsetting demand diminished by some

279
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:08,799
Regional opt outs and the right of local

280
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:10,838
governments to tax I quote the Senate

281
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,159
Bill privilege of

282
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,760
cultivation as a farmer I've never seen

283
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,639
language where it became a privilege to

284
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,799
grow an agriculture

285
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,278
crop the other major threat to a large

286
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,399
over Supply in the inate within the

287
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,600
state Market will be the current

288
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,360
estimated significant amount of state

289
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,879
sales of California cannbis uction that

290
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,519
are forced back into the intrate market

291
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:37,879
other words we know some estimate heard

292
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,399
it on the radio show that it was on

293
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:40,958
about 80% of the

294
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,639
Cannabis

295
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:47,399
sorry 80 started becoming that Professor

296
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,159
80% of uh estimated the Cannabis in

297
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,120
production California could be going out

298
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:56,039
of state either through

299
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,360
policy or by enforcement just think

300
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,838
about that we don't know what that

301
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,240
number is but let's just take it from

302
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,639
mathema iCal point of view right now if

303
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,000
the production units let's call it a th

304
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,399
thousand units that could be tons

305
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,320
whatever it doesn't matter but if 20% of

306
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:15,240
that is in in state and 80% leaves if

307
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,399
you reduce the amount of export out of

308
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,320
this state into the rest of the United

309
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,120
States it would be a 50% decrease to

310
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,440
that but it would be a

311
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,919
400% increase to the supply and you

312
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,360
would be totally oversupplied so if

313
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,799
California Growers were going to work

314
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,320
and the reason I bring that up is we

315
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,439
don't know what the fed or other

316
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,000
enforcement agencies might want to do if

317
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,079
we're going to be legally interest rate

318
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,198
interestate is there going to be further

319
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:47,838
pressure to reduce the amount of

320
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:49,879
Interstate out of the state of

321
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,519
California this could have a profound

322
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,799
impact on local Supply and ultimately

323
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,159
much lower prices to Growers this of

324
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:58,319
course might be opposite Trend if in

325
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,078
fact the restrictions and possible

326
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,879
taxation structure forces some Growers

327
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:04,599
to the alternative Marketplace and I'm

328
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,720
going to talk about that let's say that

329
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,519
fees and

330
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:12,040
structures uh become too high and since

331
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,879
um

332
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:17,719
marijuana cannabis and the black black

333
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,919
market are replacement products Growers

334
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,480
put in a devious position or dubious

335
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:26,000
position of being overt taxed over feed

336
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,120
may decide that their only alternative

337
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,120
is the export

338
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,320
Market as we think about fees fines and

339
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,000
taxes is important to first agree that

340
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,680
even in a free Marketplace some level of

341
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,159
fee and Taxation is acceptable in a

342
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,000
Democratic Society where it is

343
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:45,078
understood that government participation

344
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,720
of some limited degree is necessary for

345
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:49,919
services and oversight to prevent market

346
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,879
failures the definition of a market

347
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,838
failure in a free market is when a

348
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,240
market fails due to the inefficient

349
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,480
allocation of

350
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,480
resources this can be from a number of

351
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,240
variables but more typically is from

352
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,039
negative externalities they were talking

353
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,839
about environmental

354
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:09,319
impacts such as impacts and costs on

355
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,040
third parties such as the environment

356
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,000
other property owners or local

357
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:16,679
governments or perceived impacts to

358
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,360
local governments or can be where Market

359
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:20,719
power causes a

360
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,480
failure Market power is one I'm

361
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,040
concerned about Market power is defined

362
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,000
where an individual actor a group of

363
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:29,879
actors in The Market have substantial

364
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,639
influence on the market

365
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,958
I believe that Research indicates quite

366
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,919
clearly to some degree that in some

367
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,838
regions there has been market failures

368
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,439
due to environmental impacts and that

369
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,880
was talking about

370
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,279
earlier on those environmental impacts I

371
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:44,720
guess the only thing that I would say as

372
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,078
a grower I would just like to see

373
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,720
cannabis treated like any other crop

374
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:49,719
that's grown in

375
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,320
California and by that I'm not saying

376
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,919
give it away out I'm saying we got the

377
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,600
airboard that we got the water control

378
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:01,599
board we got Kell EPA but don't look at

379
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,000
it as a demon crop look at it as any

380
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,240
crop and therefore apply the same kind

381
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,039
of Technologies research and

382
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,680
requirements and I'll talk about that in

383
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,319
a

384
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,559
second uh fines I wanted to touch on

385
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,399
fines just a moment from a civil fine

386
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,039
point of view as as criminal fees of

387
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,679
course are and will be very much

388
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:22,319
adjudicated in the California court

389
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,599
system as established by current or

390
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,160
future

391
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,639
laws again I raise this point as a way

392
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,318
of making sure that any civil fines

393
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,759
remain in current law with agencies such

394
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:35,958
as air boards Cal EPA the water board

395
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,519
Etc and that cannabis be treated like

396
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:41,239
any other agriculture cop crop if in

397
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,318
violation in the growing process any new

398
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,519
civil find structures must be required

399
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:48,919
by State Statute to ensure no local

400
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:51,759
agency can be empowered to impose impose

401
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:54,278
fines outside the state restrictions I'm

402
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,399
I'm concerned about personal bias as a

403
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:58,679
past County Supervisor no one stands for

404
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,958
local home rule more than I especially

405
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,120
when comes to health and safety but my

406
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,758
concern is where personal bias dictates

407
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,639
public policy beyond the constraints of

408
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,839
Statute we have seen that all over the

409
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,120
United States in things other than

410
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,120
cannabis where personal people in

411
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,360
personal positions have decided not to

412
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,839
go by the law of the

413
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,919
land in

414
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,560
taxes the purpose of a tax on a good or

415
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:27,240
service is typically accepted in the

416
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:29,958
realm of good public policy two pay for

417
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,039
necessary specific or general oversight

418
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:34,518
of the function of society to mitigate

419
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,278
the externalities the impacts negative

420
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,318
impacts of products services and use of

421
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,198
private and public goods and you yes to

422
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:43,000
raise General and specific funds to

423
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,318
operate local state and federal

424
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,399
governments including education public

425
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:50,399
policy infrastructure and the many

426
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:53,078
responsibilities of government in a free

427
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,078
Society with a few exceptions most

428
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:57,879
Americans understand the need for some

429
00:16:55,078 --> 00:17:00,559
level of Taxation and the dispute

430
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:03,278
discussions of tax usually comes down to

431
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,240
the equity inquality in the action

432
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,679
actual burden and ultimate distribution

433
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,318
of service and benefits of the tax

434
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,519
revenue you notice I said a burden of

435
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,000
tax because an as an economist there is

436
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:17,038
no questioning that any degree of

437
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,759
Taxation on a product or service is a

438
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,279
burden to the market

439
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:22,279
Surplus in this

440
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:29,120
case economics one 101 what consumers

441
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,400
have left over if they buy their product

442
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,918
or service and what the producers keep

443
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,240
as margin after they sell their products

444
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,480
is the market Surplus you have heard

445
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,000
this before that in many writings out

446
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,440
there that about how taxation causes a

447
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,599
dead weight loss to a free market as a

448
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,160
revenue collected in taxes is taken from

449
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,918
the total Market Surplus anytime

450
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,720
government takes a tax it takes it out

451
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,559
of the marketplace if it's in the

452
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,200
marketplace it's spent on Capital

453
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,839
Improvements it's spent on labor but not

454
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,880
of its taxed even though I say some tax

455
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,959
and we'll get to that is necessary it is

456
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,799
my belief there is a false assumption by

457
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,159
some that California taxpayers see that

458
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:12,558
a heavy tax on cannabis will generate

459
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,880
positive outcomes either to local and

460
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,879
state government revenue sources and or

461
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,440
to solve other Financial issues within

462
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,480
their jurisdiction and therefore such

463
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,558
tax propos proposals are needed to pass

464
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,000
legalization I don't see it that way

465
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,158
California taxpayers by Nature are not

466
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,599
for excessive taxation or or have they

467
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,000
traditionally felt comfortable to

468
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,439
empower government entities to tax to

469
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,240
solve the

470
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,640
responsibilities or misjudgments of

471
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,519
government Proposition 13 is a great

472
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,840
example where taxpayers rebelled against

473
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,359
somewhat open checkbook on taxing

474
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,558
property values even though some Tout

475
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,879
The unint unintended consequences of

476
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:53,240
Prop 13 about the effects of the

477
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,760
restraint put on local governments to

478
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,038
tax property in their jurisdiction it is

479
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,480
quite evident that it did curtail The

480
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:03,319
Runaway valuations of property taxes in

481
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,319
some jurisdictions and push taxation

482
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:07,720
strategies in a more Market

483
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:10,079
consumer-driven taxation strategy by

484
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,360
stimulating investment by cities and

485
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,798
counties into Commercial Business and

486
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:17,798
retail business and generated taxes and

487
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:20,558
revenues through user

488
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:22,440
fees there has been a public policy

489
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,240
standard in California that Growers of

490
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,640
agriculture products in general have not

491
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,720
been burdened with tax on their products

492
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,799
at their level other than property tax

493
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,798
tax increases where Capital Improvements

494
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:35,119
have been made and have in fact

495
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,679
increased the value of their property

496
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:40,000
this would of course include personal

497
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:42,360
property tax on equipment supplies Etc

498
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,038
fees of course charged as mentioned

499
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:47,240
earlier to pay for oversight and

500
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:49,440
possible mitigation offsets as price

501
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,279
takers the farmers are price takers and

502
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,038
what I believe will be an oversupplied

503
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:58,798
Market at least in the inter uh short

504
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:00,640
period first two or three years any

505
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,359
necessary burdens of Taxation will force

506
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,840
Growers out of the market or down

507
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,839
another

508
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,679
path sorry for the reading but I believe

509
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,360
that California Canabis at least in the

510
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,480
near years will be sensitive to price

511
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:18,759
increases what we call and you guys have

512
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,120
read about inelastic and elastic

513
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:24,119
something that's inelastic is not price

514
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:27,000
sensitive uh diabetus medicine like I

515
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:29,599
take I'll buy it no matter how much it

516
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,599
increases cannabis at this point is what

517
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,798
we call elastic it's very price

518
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:37,519
sensitive and it will be more price

519
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:40,079
sensitive because it has a substitute a

520
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:43,240
substitute to Legal cannabis is the

521
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:47,038
black market so any price increase will

522
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,038
make it more sensitive and force

523
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:50,759
choices potential unintended

524
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,720
consequences and threats to the

525
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,200
marketplace in my

526
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,519
opinion depending how the eventual

527
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,480
legislation statute are Ena enacted the

528
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:02,000
following consequences are possible and

529
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,720
are only a few of many potential impacts

530
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,359
some have been talked about today fees

531
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,759
the allowed fee structures through the

532
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,519
lack of understanding or inent could put

533
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:12,400
the California Growers processors and

534
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:15,240
retailers of cannabis in a disadvantage

535
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,798
with other regions other products and

536
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,798
the black market I've not

537
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:22,278
understood I would asked that question

538
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:24,960
we didn't have time I will at some time

539
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:28,119
in the future why we have empowered

540
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:32,000
local government so much as a compromise

541
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:33,918
to charge fees and charge taxes somewhat

542
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,919
with an open checkbook I realize that

543
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,120
there are some restrictions but I come

544
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,080
from local governments and fees

545
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:43,759
typically are defined that we charge

546
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:46,278
them for the cost only the cost of Mi uh

547
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,000
oversight and the cost of mitigation I'm

548
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:51,319
concerned about some jurisdictions that

549
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,079
already have a bias against the growing

550
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:57,639
packaging or cultivation of cannabis if

551
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:59,558
that fee structure is not in statute by

552
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,120
the state and has limits to it I'm

553
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:02,038
concerned about where that fee structure

554
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,519
would

555
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:07,278
go fines fines that have or can have

556
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,158
local bias by administrators law

557
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:10,919
enforcement or public officials will

558
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:12,679
distort the marketplace and therefore

559
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,559
the choices of both consumers and

560
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,840
Growers again I'm concerned about the

561
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:20,960
limits on

562
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:22,720
fees taxes taxes should be defined and

563
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,759
purposeful with very distinctive

564
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,919
definitions of reason and application

565
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:29,960
that are set by State Statute and cannot

566
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,000
be altered or set by local

567
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,400
government it's not my belief even

568
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
though I come from local government that

569
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,080
local government should be empowered to

570
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,798
set a tax level that they think is

571
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:42,000
necessary for because it even says in

572
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:45,639
the current legislation it can be for

573
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,400
general purposes general purposes can be

574
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,960
for a lot of reasons it can solve

575
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,720
infrastructure problems or take care of

576
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,159
large unfunded pension

577
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,919
liabilities you know and so it needs to

578
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:59,440
be restricted I have no I I am a local

579
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,360
government

580
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,960
Advocate but the fee and tax structure

581
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:06,678
must be set by the state and local

582
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,038
governments shouldn't and and one of the

583
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:10,240
questions that we've talked a little bit

584
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:13,720
about is it even though it's going to

585
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,519
require it doesn't require a vote for a

586
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,120
local Board of Supervisors to charge a

587
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:21,558
fee it charges a vote it takes a vote to

588
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,519
raise a tax you should be very concerned

589
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:26,240
about at what tax level that's going to

590
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,558
be set typically when I was a supervisor

591
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,558
if it was for a specific reason it could

592
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,158
pass at

593
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:35,639
51% if it was for a general reason it

594
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,520
had to be 2/3 and the leg oppos pardon

595
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:42,000
just the

596
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:44,278
opposite in general 51% specific 23

597
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,200
no my city

598
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:49,558
was but think about it because if money

599
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,440
goes into the general coffers of any

600
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:54,079
local government they can spend it how

601
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,720
they want taxpayers are more concerned

602
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,759
and you can check on that but I think

603
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:02,880
you'll find it's the opposite

604
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:05,038
but but but but regardless regardless

605
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,120
regardless it's the question the

606
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:13,079
question is is that what tax at what

607
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:16,079
threshold could a local government tax

608
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:18,678
cannabis and the bill the S the Senate

609
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,879
bill says they can even tax Growers for

610
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:21,759
the privilege of

611
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,799
growing so you need to be concerned

612
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:27,240
about it's just a question um we totally

613
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,119
agree I totally agree with that you need

614
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,720
voters to do that but the the T the

615
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,959
threshold of the vote should be

616
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,440
important to

617
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,240
you if the taxation is above what is

618
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,600
considerable Equitable for the defined

619
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,640
purpose it will surely Drive some

620
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:42,918
consumers and Growers to the substitute

621
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,759
product which is the black market in no

622
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,840
realm can I consider that any tax

623
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:49,960
structure that puts a privilege tax on

624
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:52,918
Growers makes any economic or parody

625
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,038
sense as they are truly are the

626
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:56,679
risk-takers and especially in this area

627
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,519
and they talked a little bit about it if

628
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:01,640
Growers I'm very much in this industry

629
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:04,639
because the industries I come from we

630
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,759
survive many times by having co-ops

631
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,720
grower co-ops I think are very necessary

632
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,119
in this industry because you are small I

633
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,038
think the margins are going to be small

634
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,959
but you can't have a co-op if it doesn't

635
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:18,679
allow vertical integration because

636
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,120
co-ops don't just grow the power of a

637
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,600
co-op is to grow it bring it in package

638
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,719
it together negotiate the price ship it

639
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:29,038
and then deliver it to your Growers on a

640
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:33,399
parody basis so I think a Co-op is a

641
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:36,398
very important part of what's

642
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:36,398
necessary

643
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,839
um they should be granted the same

644
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,120
reverence uh given to all agrarian

645
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,639
stewards and I talk about All Growers in

646
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,038
California we should not punish an

647
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,120
emerging valid industry due to actions

648
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:54,119
of some bad players in the past it is a

649
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:57,038
crop what you guys said up here was

650
00:25:54,119 --> 00:26:00,918
great I think you said that is is

651
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:03,278
treated because no one no one wants

652
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,520
herbicide and pesticide on cannabis more

653
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:07,000
than I do that's the power of value

654
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,558
added some of you asked about that if

655
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,919
you want to give value it's kind of like

656
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:13,278
growing I grow uh uh pomegranates I ship

657
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,960
them all over the world and they're

658
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,720
organic I get value because they know

659
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,880
what I've used and not used we need the

660
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,240
same thing with

661
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,600
cannabis and then the last thing is

662
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,519
Market power unless we are very very

663
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:30,240
careful about watching who has the power

664
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,240
of distribution

665
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:35,359
uh and make sure that we close all the

666
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,038
gaps some could become Power Players and

667
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:43,639
it's not going to be

668
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:45,798
Growers uh Growers going to be trying to

669
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,200
just survive and barely survive in this

670
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:50,639
market for the next few years the co-ops

671
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,080
would help you um this could easily

672
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,120
happen if the structure disallows

673
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,759
Growers to have efficiency capabilities

674
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,319
and some degree of vertical integration

675
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:59,759
if the distribution of retail is is

676
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,558
controlled by a Chosen Few it will

677
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,879
surely cause a degree of Market power

678
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:05,440
causing damage to the grower consumer

679
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,480
and ultimately to those seeking tax

680
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,558
revenues in the process it actually in a

681
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,679
free market Society what you want is you

682
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:16,079
want the sellers and buyers to be

683
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,000
creative and and create a lot of Revenue

684
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:21,199
and that's where you get total tax

685
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,319
revenue is the highest volume we can get

686
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,399
with the lowest tax and we look for that

687
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:28,278
equilibrium so I'm just concerned about

688
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:30,359
that I I think they've done fabulous

689
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:32,519
work the things I'm bringing up today

690
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:34,240
are just the questions that if you don't

691
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,798
ask over the next several

692
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,399
months and by

693
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:42,038
2016 it's the questions if you want the

694
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:43,798
answers we have to ask the questions but

695
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:46,000
I think there's been a lot of work I've

696
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:48,480
talked to so many of you I I I think

697
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,599
there's great hope this industry needs

698
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,278
to be legitimized I get asked all the

699
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:55,319
time after two and a half years how big

700
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:57,480
it is no one knows no one knows because

701
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:59,240
we can't measure it you know it's it's

702
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,240
called the of the favorite things in the

703
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,759
economic world we say is uh if we can

704
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,120
measure it we can manage it and what we

705
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:09,519
should ask our legislators is to allow

706
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:12,038
us to measure it so we can manage it and

707
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,519
to take the Handcuff off take the

708
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:17,200
Handcuff off The Growers and

709
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,880
distribution um to allow this to become

710
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,840
a true Marketplace legitimize the

711
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,880
product and let this build into

712
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,129
something that would be

713
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:34,839
substantial thank you

714
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:34,839
[Applause]

715
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:40,398
questions you mentioned how the uh the

716
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,038
states might impose uh punitive fees in

717
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,359
a way that would would not be

718
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:46,000
advantageous to the industry but isn't

719
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:47,839
that also part of like a free market

720
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,079
that if some municipalities want to say

721
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,359
look we've got a bias against this then

722
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,639
then the businesses will move to other

723
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,639
municipalities that are very welcoming

724
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,600
we don't do that in the alcohol

725
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,679
industry you know why is can

726
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:04,599
why is or aspirin or I can name a number

727
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,880
of products why do we Empower local

728
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,319
government I was talking to one of my

729
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,960
students at one of the universities I

730
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:10,079
teach the other day was from France he

731
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,840
said I don't understand this he was

732
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,000
reading the law he said in France if we

733
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,398
pass something it's good for the whole

734
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,119
country you're going to pass something

735
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,558
in California and few areas say you

736
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,558
don't have to have it here it's that's

737
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,119
not a free market free market is where

738
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:25,359
uh both sellers and buyers can get

739
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,759
together in an open market because if

740
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,479
not you're going to have a this is going

741
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:29,919
to be a market that's going to market

742
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,038
failures in certain areas because of

743
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,159
those restrictions now it may just be

744
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:35,720
something we work through and I think

745
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:38,240
you guys mentioned great it may be a few

746
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,038
where at first some don't want it and

747
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,519
decide later on as everything comes

748
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:44,079
along it'll work that way but unless

749
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,839
you're knocking on those doors I if

750
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,798
you're a grower how do you know where

751
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,079
your product's going to go you know how

752
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,158
do you know who's going to opt out and

753
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:54,439
who's not it's it's just it'd be like

754
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,200
the products that I sell my pomegranates

755
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,038
if I could only sell them in Kings

756
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,200
County it has x value if I can sell them

757
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,839
in 10 counties it has a different value

758
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,319
if I can sell them worldwide it changes

759
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,959
the value of that

760
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,558
product yes do you guys would be uh

761
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,640
would be great to get some of your

762
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,359
Insight on how the taxation is likely to

763
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,038
take place do you foresee happening each

764
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,000
time Canabis moves through the value

765
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,038
chain or just at the end and do you see

766
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,278
it happening on value added each stage

767
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:26,319
or on the the total value each I've read

768
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:28,919
all the bills and and watched all your

769
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,000
guys work God bless you and and talk to

770
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,799
a lot of other attorneys about it and I

771
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,278
still can't get that interpretation all

772
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,839
I can see right now is that the only

773
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:39,720
restriction that I really see a local

774
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,398
government can decide what level of

775
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,440
Taxation it needs the only thing they're

776
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,879
restricted by is the thing that I don't

777
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,519
we don't know the answer to Is at what

778
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,640
threshold will the voters permit that to

779
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,558
be but I didn't see any constraints on

780
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,240
that that that the tax what that tax

781
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:58,759
would be and or what the fees could be

782
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,000
some counties I I can tell you coming

783
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,558
from

784
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,159
kelper

785
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:06,359
that I'm I'm for pensions and for all

786
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,799
that but there are some jurisdictions

787
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:10,839
that are financially struggling pensions

788
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,119
infrastructure and others that need a

789
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:15,839
bigger percentage of something than

790
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:18,278
others so is is that a way you know

791
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,199
without that's a reason I most of the

792
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:22,240
time I I like governance from the bottom

793
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,840
up in this case I would love to see

794
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,359
guidance from the state that puts in law

795
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:30,119
the maximum amount of tax that can be

796
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:35,158
charged by local local government and

797
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:35,158
fees because if not who

798
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,359
decides it seems like there's a basic

799
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,839
contradiction we're calling it

800
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:45,479
medicine you can't tax medicine yeah

801
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,678
that's the problem and and it's very

802
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,639
simple I'm glad to see the guys that you

803
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,679
have working on this from the

804
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:52,879
legislature because they understand

805
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:54,440
medicine the problem is is first of all

806
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,399
you need to recognize it as a true

807
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,278
agricultural crop for what it is number

808
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:01,798
one two is if if the people have voted

809
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,278
and said that it medical marijuana makes

810
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:05,000
sense that it's legal in California then

811
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:06,558
you need to recognize it as a medicine

812
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,319
and treat it that

813
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:13,398
way then first of all you wouldn't be

814
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:15,678
taxing a me a medical product and you

815
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:19,719
certainly wouldn't be taxing the

816
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:24,159
Growers um Sor well thanks Tony um it's

817
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,159
a round of applause please for Tony

818
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:32,240
um I uh I hope I hope I hope the

819
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:35,558
legislators are listening carefully uh

820
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,079
to to an academic who's actually studies

821
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:39,558
and gets deep into the effects of these

822
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:42,558
things and we know we do have to do

823
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,558
cleanup
