- you're gonna share about the this the

11
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,149
reality what it took to grow that this

12
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,240
year you don't want to know nobody

13
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:41,359
I knew because it was a tough fucking

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:45,359
year I mean yeah it started with a

15
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:47,640
atmospheric River and 150 year flood and

16
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,519
where'd you grow are we I'm right here

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,759
how's it go where do you go yeah just

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,530
has it arrow in Sonoma County 150 year

19
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,629
flood yeah I was a maybe I'll

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,880
exaggerating bite then it was your deal

21
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,730
with well every year water every bit of

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,920
a hundred year flood and then so did you

23
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,319
see the worms like literally rise up out

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,290
and try to find shelter from the soil

25
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:13,079
like guys actually didn't flood oh great

26
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:17,490
you know but other farms did flood so

27
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:20,039
you're up on a hill yeah you what yeah

28
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:25,199
yeah where we're at about 800 feet in

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,810
elevation so we South self base no no

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,129
not at all we have north east and west

31
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:35,820
facing I like it actually which you know

32
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:38,280
like perspective is everything that's

33
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,859
right so they're you know it just really

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,890
depends on what what how do your girls

35
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:46,049
like it like it changes on how do they

36
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,280
like grown with the different light

37
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,370
profile

38
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,710
well I mean I do mix light like that oh

39
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:58,050
you do yeah okay so it's not just only

40
00:01:53,709 --> 00:02:01,599
an outdoor yeah I specifically focus on

41
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:04,149
like full spectrum lighting so I'm

42
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,219
really push it to the edge I use like I

43
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:09,909
have you know I I kind of have a

44
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:13,270
hodgepodge of lighting but I have like h

45
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:15,849
PS is t fives far reds and then the

46
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,590
light depth cover itself so you know

47
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:19,750
which you're manipulating the Sun then

48
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,180
so you basically have about 400

49
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,009
different ways you can just come at it

50
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,709
and then you can control the photo

51
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:29,679
timing of the photo period so you know

52
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:31,379
you can really manipulate a lot of you

53
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,640
can get the plant to express itself

54
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:36,009
you're working with it in a lot of

55
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:37,839
different ways really great one of the

56
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:41,409
things that I've really worked on doing

57
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,170
is like this silver og which is a 63 day

58
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:46,539
plant I've been able to finish it in 53

59
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:52,779
days a hundred percent for real no

60
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:54,459
bullshit and like in 2017 we took third

61
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:59,890
at the Emerald cup in light debt with

62
00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:02,170
our silver og that we grow grew in yeah

63
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:04,329
I was like those 10 days short from

64
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:06,219
where well that was in like our 12 year

65
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,620
old soil at the time so we've got this

66
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,629
you know still grow yeah we've got this

67
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:15,280
- you're not tilling you're not rip yeah

68
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:17,379
no no I'm I do this no-till we've been

69
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,860
doing no-till like that for like 16

70
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:24,489
years 17 years so you know we haven't

71
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,019
bought bottled nutrients basically in 15

72
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,239
year you know everything great for

73
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,400
pretty much ever you know now and then a

74
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,610
little a bottle here and they're just

75
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,620
you know for maybe for some but at this

76
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:39,040
point yeah I haven't bought anything in

77
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:43,329
ever in 2017 when we placed third at the

78
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:47,620
Emerald cup we really were eliminating

79
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:49,000
everything opposed to adding stuff to

80
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,930
our system we're in a problem in a

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,780
process of eliminating refining getting

82
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,610
rid of less is more

83
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,360
look is more if it's not broke don't fix

84
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,060
it so I mean

85
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,400
getting rid of it or fix it I'm really

86
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,750
what I focus on is trust you know that's

87
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,400
what it's about it's about trusting

88
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,560
nature trusting your relationship with

89
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,289
the plants and and doing what they tell

90
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,020
you and not imposing your will on them

91
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:17,000
and just do what they say and and it's

92
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,310
it's really simple except it's really

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,709
not that simple you know so it's not

94
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:24,410
simple because literally everything we

95
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:27,410
thought we knew tells us to do something

96
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:30,500
a little different than right right yeah

97
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,630
I get to spend time with my kids and I

98
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,879
don't and and I have no fear of them

99
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:37,550
eating anything in my garden there's no

100
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,790
poisons there's no pesticides that right

101
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,710
I use life to grow life and then people

102
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:48,260
go out and they buy a probiotic and they

103
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:52,989
take a pill that life is on outdoor

104
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:55,490
grown living soil no tilled mature life

105
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:59,480
that it's on it you don't have to take a

106
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:02,120
pro body your food is like yeah yeah I

107
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,300
grow potatoes South African ground

108
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,590
cherries anything invasive basically

109
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,240
with my cannabis for a you know first

110
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:14,869
several reasons you know whether it's

111
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:20,990
IPM or just for food to just because

112
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:22,490
well they're part of the same just

113
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,960
different flowers we have two

114
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,250
chrysanthemum

115
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:30,469
and yarrow and nettles I mean the

116
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:34,160
Stillman it pretty much marigolds are

117
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:36,860
often recommended together so many I

118
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,110
found this year that the sunflower like

119
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,840
it was the indicator species if I was

120
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,030
going to even see an aphid and then it

121
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,179
became red based species where I never

122
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:50,508
had a problem on any plants but there

123
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,519
were a few on flowers yeah cool yeah

124
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:53,870
there for me I didn't have a lot going

125
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,310
on this year because it was kind of a

126
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,079
crazy year and we were actually not

127
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,538
going to plant at all we weren't really

128
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:02,649
planted at all until the last minute you

129
00:05:59,538 --> 00:06:06,199
know because we started the year with a

130
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:08,508
atmospheric River which you know brought

131
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,330
down like a hundred year flood which

132
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:13,729
kind of fucked everything up slowed

133
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:15,379
everything down we didn't have a foot

134
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:17,918
you know phones or you know okay

135
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:20,779
everything did you get more overwatered

136
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:23,889
yeah on our road slid out so I was

137
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:27,829
literally doing tractor work for from

138
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:29,228
whenever it for up til when when I

139
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:32,209
should have been working on my farm

140
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:34,370
installing my mic cultivation my outdoor

141
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:37,668
site which so I wasn't doing that

142
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:40,668
so then I'm doing road work and then by

143
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:43,430
the time and then plus the state they

144
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:44,839
were you know stalling so it was like

145
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,490
you know you're kind of broke at this

146
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:48,439
point as a small farmer you're broke you

147
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,598
got like five grand and you're like

148
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,550
should I spend it on plants or should I

149
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:54,918
you know just keep my pocket because if

150
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,680
I spent on the plants which the state

151
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,478
hasn't renewed my license yet so and if

152
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,699
they don't renew my license then I'll be

153
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:03,860
out of compliance so then I'll have no

154
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:06,650
money I have to cut down my plants dig

155
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,800
them up sell them try to hustle plants

156
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:14,029
or whatever to recoup whatever your last

157
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:17,060
which you know your last dollars so we

158
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:18,439
decided to just not plant you know which

159
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,240
was like at that point you're playing

160
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:23,389
Russian roulette because they're like

161
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,389
will the state renew my license on that

162
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:27,620
date if I'm planted and then well

163
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:30,110
they're going to just come in like you

164
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,968
know slam you if you're out of compliant

165
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,908
oh you had plants and pots just waiting

166
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:36,588
weird you know I just didn't I usually

167
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:37,349
do seed and would have a whole bunch of

168
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:39,389
plants

169
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,950
to anything because I didn't know what

170
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,919
was going to happen so I did nothing so

171
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:46,649
then when it was like Sunday night at

172
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,449
like 6 o'clock they call us when Monday

173
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:50,969
morning it's going to expire they called

174
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:53,339
Renu at Sunday night but that was like

175
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:57,720
in July you know so then it was like you

176
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:59,189

180
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,920

if you you know I'm yeah I can work

188
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,319
anything and I got this - I had some 24k

189
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:29,909
which beautiful was challenging because

190
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,879
it literally like quadrupled in size

191
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:35,009
I've never had a plant grow so much and

192
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,439
maybe it was because of my the regime

193
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:39,960
that I was doing what this jadam liquid

194
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,000
fertilizer yeah it's some stuff starts

195
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,220
you happy I really I really feel like

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,940
have you done Jude yeah yeah okay and

197
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:51,029
the Cana practices that the IMO's it's

198
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,820
it's beautiful and the science behind it

199
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:57,179
is on point like this is not guesswork

200
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:00,360
anymore like you can prove it like you

201
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:03,120
can prove with scientific tests that the

202
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,480
plant grown in your soil is different

203
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,250
then the same cultivar grown down the

204
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,159
street alright in crappy well the

205
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,049
bacteria you know there's just it that's

206
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,699
what I am most about yeah that's why

207
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:16,309
that's what I am oh is and you're just

208
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,080
working with your team

209
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:21,019
already there you just got to give him a

210
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,629
hand yeah and there they're like dude we

211
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,579
like the work you know that guy wants to

212
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,919
hang out at the bar but definitely hate

213
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,600
how they start I just feed my soil like

214
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,549
twice a year I don't even I'm not in

215
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,889
like a plant feeding schedule I'm

216
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:38,539
running a soil feeding schedule yep nice

217
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:42,019
in here I'll feed my soil like basically

218
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:45,049
like hi fungal woodchips worm castings

219
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:47,929
you know just keep lots of green matter

220
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:50,809
grasses you drive around if whatever I

221
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:52,129
get the Genoa leaves where everybody

222
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:53,809
else is driving to the gross store

223
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:56,778
you're like that wood chip pile has good

224
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:58,819
value that gardener over there I know

225
00:09:56,778 --> 00:10:00,500
that lady doesn't use any pesticides I'm

226
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,480

227
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,720
rolled off and get my Road it was like

228
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,278

oh they gotta go in the dorm with you

243
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,650
you know not in the cannabis garden

244
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,850
right your I understand they're not

245
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:46,069
allowed to yeah that would be breaking

246
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,889
the law and know how it works

247
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:51,080
okay personal what I mean is thank you

248
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:54,409
for your prayer don't know about plants

249
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:58,160
yeah it changes how I interact with them

250
00:10:54,409 --> 00:11:00,879
because I'm growing them too you know

251
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:03,350
and so they're they're learning about

252
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,570
patience and character and my

253
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,940
seven-year-old yet is big he's got like

254
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,129
104 gallon you know here that's his you

255
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,779
can do whatever he wants he chopped and

256
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:18,000
drought the whole damn thing in the mid

257
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:19,588
and I'm like okay but it's his learning

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,389
experience because he's in the garden

259
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:24,330
with me you know what I mean

260
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:26,370
where do I want them that's where I want

261
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,860
you you know and it sounds like you're

262
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,710
your garden is beautiful yeah you know

263
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,990
it's it's a learning experience you know

264
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:36,389
this year the beautiful beautiful thing

265
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,730
about focusing on the plant spirit

266
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:42,929
medicine end of it is that it distracts

267
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:46,909
you from the the pathogen the pathogen

268
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:46,909
of compliance

269
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,619
that was some Josh from Dragon I want

270
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:55,958
you to wait and repeat that because

271
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:57,879
that's not funny that's from like Josh

272
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:00,988
they're doing beautiful JA share that

273
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:05,920
with me today close and that really is

274
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:07,929
what it is the it's like a pathogen but

275
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,748
you know so we just have to find on a

276
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:12,970
microscope I don't know

277
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:15,069
we know I'm kind of like I'm really I'm

278
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,678
really like if it ain't broke don't fix

279
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,399
it less is more so you just listen to

280
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:20,769
the plants

281
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,389
you know you know this is where there's

282
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:25,899
all this science and science is great

283
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:28,539
but technically you just don't need to

284
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,399
know the science it does not matter it

285
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,748
doesn't change anything it only change

286
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,178
it you only really need to know it if

287
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:36,249
there's a problem if there's no problems

288
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:38,678
why would you spend your whole life

289
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:42,790
researching something when you don't

290
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:45,249
have to if you just do it this way with

291
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:48,248
with you know which is like a very

292
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:51,220
specific way you know yeah this this way

293
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:53,019
the way this way the way is basically

294
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,939
like five things you know as long as you

295
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:57,399
do the five things you don't have to do

296
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:59,168
the loop it's it's not what I do it's

297
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,568
what I won't do the list of what I won't

298
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:04,239
do is like huge but the things that I

299
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:07,438
need to do are five things yeah which is

300
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:11,048
focus on the ground you know focus on

301
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:15,338
the light you know you know fire or

302
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:17,769
light air and water and then the void

303
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:19,540
or this plant spirit medicine end of it

304
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:22,328
so as long as I focus on those five

305
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:24,698
things and stay on track that guides me

306
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:27,548
and I don't have to impose my will

307
00:13:24,698 --> 00:13:29,588
because everything is done for you you

308
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:31,948
bring that it's like so I don't need to

309
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:34,239
know all the science in the world so

310
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:36,548
because it's just like you just have to

311
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:37,319
listen and do what you're told is really

312
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:39,730
simple

313
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:41,438
except it's it's it's challenging

314
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,839
because you have to build that

315
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:46,298
relationship of trust which takes time

316
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,160
and you got to put in your time to build

317
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:49,838
relationships of trust with your plans

318
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,028
with your plants which is kind of like

319
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,989
grabbing smoke you know what I mean

320
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:57,308
ropes of sand

321
00:13:52,989 --> 00:14:00,189
yeah you just have to like yeah I'm

322
00:13:57,308 --> 00:14:02,078
listening to so yeah we're dog is like

323
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:03,278
right there you know like well we're

324
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:04,508
like a great a second wagging their

325
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,058
tails then yeah all the time

326
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:09,369
where the plants are like you know it's

327
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:11,139
just like you got to hang out it's like

328
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:13,720
a whisper and the wind you're like wait

329
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:16,119
wait sit well if you think you heard

330
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:20,829
something you did you know like have you

331
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:24,428
I know you have what but most people

332
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:26,528
don't hang out in the garden yeah it's

333
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:28,058
wait don't tell me that I don't want to

334
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:30,610
hear that but that's no I hear that's

335
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:34,350
what we work I know there's a remind a

336
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:37,688
bunch of you know no but there's there's

337
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,330
no I hear that Needham now that you can

338
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:42,208
grow a plant

339
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,399
I'm just on it yeah and just be a piece

340
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:46,109
of fish yeah and go hang out with your

341
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,708
kids yeah

342
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:51,870
Castle is allowing for that too yeah

343
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:55,229
yeah and your personal space you can

344
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,600
have your fat your whole family yeah and

345
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,820
the plants are part of it because

346
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,490
they're part of the ecosystem and you

347
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:07,260
are part of that ecosystem and so when

348
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:09,990
we build soil yeah when I type does your

349
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:14,069
phone ever autocorrect do you have a

350
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:18,720
phone yes I did get a phone I did just

351
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:21,329
get one year ago it's a monster it is

352
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,370
it's her knee it'll teach Rachel's eggs

353
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:25,049
and you're just like hold on I literally

354
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,500
have the rule when I go out to the

355
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,979
garden

356
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:32,429
I'll I'll record like time-lapse oh yeah

357
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,649
so that I can't be on my phone my

358
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:36,419
phone's doing something and I'm doing

359
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:38,339
something you see what yeah I don't want

360
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:42,208
that yeah we did a time-lapse of us

361
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:44,880
rolling 150 joints last night it's

362
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:50,639
beautiful I love it yeah yeah we're like

363
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:51,360
so tell me so so tell me about your

364
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,860
strengths

365
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:59,490
oh my favorite that's words tell me

366
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,620
about your girls right I mean I can run

367
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,419
anything it's not like rock it's sort of

368
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,289
not rocket science you have to be able

369
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,909
to adapt and and feed this you know just

370
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:11,610
adapt okay so are we talking about

371
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:14,370
feeding soil we're talking about feeding

372
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,259
the biology the life is in the oil you

373
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,389
can do that a lot of different ways

374
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,309
right so it's not a lot of ways to skin

375
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:22,769
that cat so it sounds like you use cover

376
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:24,479
crops yeah oh yeah so you have all their

377
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:25,980
life growing it's not just a lone

378
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,440
soldier standing out there by themselves

379
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,480
oh yeah I have okay I'm gonna lay it on

380
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:35,959
you my system you're gonna love this

381
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:40,100
it's it's a a scaleable high production

382
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:43,289
no-till micro remediated subterranean

383
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,750
full-spectrum light depth bioretention

384
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:49,250
pit

385
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:54,350
technique so yes that's what we've been

386
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:55,940
missing that's like that's beautiful I

387
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,830
know what that mean you know what that

388
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,500
means you know you know that use the

389
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:04,850
layers upon layers of like took a while

390
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:06,709
to realize even realize that's what I

391
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,419
was doing because I've always been doing

392
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:10,850
that technique honestly since the

393
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,640
beginning because that's what I was told

394
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:15,259
to do so I did that and I true now I

395
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,990
just trusted the process from the

396
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:19,910
beginning and it's kind of like now now

397
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:22,609
the benefit of having a microscope and

398
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,250
learning all the science it's like when

399
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:29,149
I when I learn some science after living

400
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,470
it for 15 years right I'm like oh my god

401
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,450
that's what that's called yeah I

402
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,910
definitely think I didn't even know I

403
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,940
didn't even know I was doing no-till for

404
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:41,300
12 years doing it it's a point those

405
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,250
labels you know I went to fate MJ for

406
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,200
the first year MD vision Vegas and I was

407
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,609
like I was like I'm doing no-till I

408
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,610
think I was like I think we're doing all

409
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:57,139
these you know you're dumb now I'm doing

410
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,450
Jaedong which I've been doing for 15

411
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,060
right scenes and I'm doing living soil

412
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,549
yeah yeah now the newest one is you Dom

413
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:06,710
that you're growing man yes so you just

414
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:09,470
it's just yet exactly that's what it's

415
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,329
about it is adapting growing you're

416
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:15,589
growing yourself that's right that's

417
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:17,539
been the the bet the the most beneficial

418
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:19,490
thing I mean you get to actually work on

419
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:21,710
yourself that's some real shit and it

420
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:24,109
takes a lot of work and dedication I've

421
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:27,170
been doing like Depp so long right like

422
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:29,899
I've got like 5,000 hours into just

423
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:32,420
pulling covers alone so that's equal

424
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,840
that's equal to pulling a cover every

425
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,700
day twice a day for the next ten years

426
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:38,240
straight every day for ten years

427
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,850
straight

428
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,309
that's dedication that you know that's

429
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:43,609
discipline you know the main beautiful

430
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:46,118
man

431
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:48,068
so that's with the leg

432
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:49,208
the things you learn with experimenting

433
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:52,148
with different parts of the spectrum

434
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:55,209
well just shortening shortening my

435
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:58,628
harvest times I can take a sixty-three

436
00:18:55,209 --> 00:19:00,939
day strain and finish it in 53 days or I

437
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:03,728
was taking a purple punch and and that's

438
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:05,798
like that was finishing it out and I

439
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:08,828
can't even believe it I know it's have

440
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:12,608
to do it again it was like 35 40 days

441
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:14,678
like completely 40 days it was like it

442
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:16,418
was like dying now there's so much

443
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:18,778
because a lot of people like oh it's

444
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:21,699
like you know it's like you must have a

445
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:24,189
degree Yale because it planted blades or

446
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:26,259
you know no I mean the silver oh gee

447
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:29,829
I've been doing when I took third at the

448
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:32,019
Emerald cup I did that not only do I not

449
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:34,898
only do i shortened the harvest time by

450
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:38,169
10 days but I don't water for a month

451
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:40,988
because of my soil so yeah I I charge my

452
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:42,849
soil I charge my soil and then for the

453
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:45,848
last month I don't water for 28 days

454
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:48,668
straight you don't but who does I mean

455
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:52,118
the funds rise oh yes yeah they're

456
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:54,159
literally feeding your plan and it's

457
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:55,688
it's it's allowing that plant to control

458
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,509
that very fine too much they're just

459
00:19:55,689 --> 00:20:00,819
like diving and just but you know they

460
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:03,608
also grow out that a lot of young spread

461
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:05,979
but it's it's the other life that's part

462
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:08,438
of the team yeah you know and so you can

463
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:11,288
literally like I know people that dry

464
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:13,509
farm it yeah they do have water at all

465
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:15,308
right right yeah I'm not quite in the in

466
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:17,288
the environment but you got to have the

467
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:19,808
environment and part of that environment

468
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:23,558
is that the life and that's what turns

469
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:25,689
dirt into soil yeah no and you're me I

470
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:28,058
mean trying to focus on like high fungal

471
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:31,479
you know wood anything - like in Gap

472
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:34,949
yeah you know so you know there hasn't

473
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:37,869
been a lot of this is all kind of just

474
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:39,429
coming about so you're just kind of

475
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:40,990
winging it you know we're all kind of

476
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:42,309
winging it on some level

477
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,429
but it's working oh yeah it's totally

478
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:48,129
working it's totally working yeah yeah

479
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:51,460
I'm really just in love with that

480
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:53,440
connection and that relationship so yeah

481
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,538
now that the science is just gonna be

482
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,470
like if that's what blows my mind is

483
00:20:55,538 --> 00:21:02,230
like learning like really it what it

484
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,000
creates just a different language yeah

485
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:08,288
it allows you to interact with people

486
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,869
yeah they did instead of pulling light

487
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:12,788
depth arts they spent the last 10 years

488
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:15,278
looking through a microscope so with

489
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:17,619
that same intensity and passion and they

490
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:19,659
figured some tricks out that you've

491
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:21,038
learned to write right pulling tires you

492
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:24,850
don't do it the same way you did the

493
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:28,000
first day do you know yeah and so having

494
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:31,509
that bigger picture right right like

495
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,778
your soil creates that depth I go to

496
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:37,890
farms that like good cannabis in Hampton

497
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:40,419
but also strawberries and spinach and

498
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:45,940
baby squash you know whatever you know

499
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:50,679
right and those plants grow in dirt it

500
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:52,419
is not alive it is like and you can see

501
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:54,550
I can show you like it it's that

502
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:56,860
clear-cut

503
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:59,259
and we miss yeah it doesn't have to be

504
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:02,379
like that with with it doesn't have to

505
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:04,539
be like that yeah and and you don't even

506
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,790
have to like know all the labels yeah

507
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:08,920
and that's the nice part yeah you don't

508
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:11,769
have to know that it's really easy to

509
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:14,320
get like hung up on the label you need

510
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:16,960
to know what you're intense what you're

511
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:20,049
trying to do I'm trying to encourage

good description I like they know it

517
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,890

621
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:44,209
a part of a scuba rig that I write

622
00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:46,519
that's funny a scuba ring I haven't

623
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:48,979
heard that one okay yeah tell me more

624
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,739
it's part of a scuba rig it's the

625
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:52,129
regulator on a scuba tank that's a good

626
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:56,079
cover

627
00:27:52,128 --> 00:28:03,848
Wow today I with helps me breathe

628
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:03,848
[Music]

629
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:16,469
it's I call it the industrial

630
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:19,350
steamroller the safety is on right now

631
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:23,100
because it's not really in steamroller

632
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:27,349
mode technically so you know it's it the

633
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:30,719
safety is on because it's dangerous

634
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:32,309
it'll fuck you up it hits hard

635
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,309
it's not fair that's why I don't

636
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:39,059
necessarily pass it around so you have

637
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:41,849
an inner chamber and and tubes that is

638
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:44,759
there water no there's no water it's

639
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:47,369
just direct drive okay it's got a manual

640
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:47,849
transmission it sounds like a car I love

641
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:51,179
it

642
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:52,829
hi righto they say it really started as

643
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,900
a joke but like all good things that

644
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:57,149
start as a joke there's actually a

645
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,640
really good idea and then we just kind

646
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:02,880
of kept rolling with it because you know

647
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,450
it worked you know I had a buddy he says

648
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,400
you know what you take the shit and turn

649
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,590
it into some good and I'm like yeah I

650
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,870
make compost you know it's like

651
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:15,919
sometimes you can do

652
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:18,489
for real and it feels really good to do

653
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,490
it for real

654
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:22,690
do you like metalwork um a welder

655
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:25,390
upgrades I do shipping container

656
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:27,308
buildings I do my building

657
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:30,530
I've been they're afraid resource like

658
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:33,980
expedition vehicles nice right

659
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:37,160
like that I I have a 40-foot I use it

660
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:39,680
for everything like a 40-foot shipping

661
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,910
container see train but I you there's

662
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,070
like three grand

663
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:46,970
it's cheaper than one of those sheds at

664
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:48,259
Home Depot man and I grow I have worm

665
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:52,250
bins in there

666
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:54,410
I've got like it's it's alive and it

667
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,150
allows me to have a habitat that's out

668
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,519
of the elements and I can control a

669
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:01,580
little bit more that's just little

670
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:06,079
cruising all year long it's pretty

671
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:07,970
amazing stuff yeah I built this 3,000

672
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:12,289
square-foot shipping container building

673
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:14,660
out of scrap and surplus steel by the

674
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:17,059
pound by the pound so I built the

675
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:20,980
building essentially by the pallet and

676
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:26,119
then I built all the decking out of

677
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:30,829
old-growth redwood 2x6

678
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:32,509
that i milled from my property trees

679
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,799
yeah there are trees from our per they

680
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:35,240
needed you know they were not the

681
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,889
healthiest trees because they're all

682
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,529
growth they've been through a lot of

683
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:41,690
fires and bugs so is more of a culling

684
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:43,220
it was more of a culling of the forest

685
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,289
it's not like I'm fucking cutting down

686
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,299
old-growth you know I'm calling I'm

687
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:49,309
calling the forest for sure for the

688
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:52,069
health of the forest so the trees that

689
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:53,079
are not scarred to shape I am full of

690
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:55,118
logs

691
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:57,970
rotten and burnt out and we're gonna

692
00:30:55,118 --> 00:31:00,069
fall over on your how whatever you know

693
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:03,009
you you know it's better to take those

694
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:04,898
down mill those clear the forest out and

695
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:07,599
then the trees that are there will grow

696
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:09,668
like thirty to sixty percent more so

697
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,469
your children will most well be more

698
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:14,619
likely to have some millaa millaa

699
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:17,470
boyhood in the future or and protect the

700
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:20,199
forest you change the photo period of

701
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:22,989
that space right you've changed the life

702
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,119
and it explodes and stuff that you

703
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:27,639
haven't seen in years because it's just

704
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:29,528
been waiting you know it takes a long

705
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:32,258
time for those Giants to fall on their

706
00:31:29,528 --> 00:31:37,138
own and it waits for years it's so great

707
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:39,909
yeah like what is that my puck here Mike

708
00:31:37,138 --> 00:31:41,648
yeah no you really have to yeah plus I

709
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:44,980
have this new thing for my excavator

710
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:47,048
this flail mower yeah

711
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,640
so I can reach like 25 feet in the air

712
00:31:47,048 --> 00:31:53,369
and just like mulch a tree to the ground

713
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,790
and tato three-dimensional it totally

714
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:57,509
takes away that brat yeah I don't have

715
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,339
to touch it

716
00:31:57,509 --> 00:32:01,950
I don't have to touch it I can take like

717
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:04,919
down to a five inch tree just right to

718
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:07,710
the ground and just in my emotion like

719
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:10,440
literally just working them I can suck

720
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,240
all the branches in and just shoot the

721
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,360
leaves down and just mulch the whole

722
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:19,440
tree and I'll have like mulch like this

723
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,759
deep needy knee-deep mulch the forest is

724
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,009
like so happy about that

725
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,680
it could not be happier because that's

726
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:29,160
what the forest wants to eat is it's

727
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:32,160
only it's that's why that's what that's

728
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:35,310
why I've been focusing on just feeding

729
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,259
my plants cannabis leaves because that's

730
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:39,119
how they're meat even the male's out of

731
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:41,069
the garden eat they have purpose right

732
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:47,459
but the cannabis leaves fed to your

733
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:51,299
plants in it yeah yeah in an anaerobic

734
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:54,180
process so it speeds up the deferment

735
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:57,169
you know the process of breaking down

736
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:59,630
the organic matter and makes the

737
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:02,590
inorganic nutrients available

738
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:04,380
I mean think of Italy growing with life

739
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:08,509
yeah

740
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,700
and what does that mean like it changes

741
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:12,129
[Music]

742
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:14,380
basically instead of it taking a year

743
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:16,660
you can you quick you know you speed it

744
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:19,420
up to like three days two weeks a month

745
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:22,800
and three months this season or whatever

746
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:25,390
we do soil testing and it was a total

747
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,889
total basket case of the site and

748
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:30,310
nothing there except what they call

749
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:33,870
silty clay it's like concrete or moon

750
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:37,569
dust it is no in between it's ridiculous

751
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:39,829
it went from a two inch to a three foot

752
00:33:37,569 --> 00:33:43,788
soil death

753
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:47,509
just by adding lights and feeding the

754
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:51,169
soil it's amazing if you throw grasses

755
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:52,940
like Sudan grass cut it down and keep

756
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:55,730
laying it down and then spray it with

757
00:33:52,940 --> 00:34:00,200
like an IMO for yeah laid out that light

758
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:02,899
it'll go travel down 50 feet or whatever

759
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,350
into the ground and just bring it to

760
00:34:02,898 --> 00:34:09,138
life that's it that's incorrect that is

761
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:10,159
magic that's straight-up magic as far as

762
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:12,679
them that's impressive

763
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,809
oh I need coal bulbs I can go get it

764
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:16,789
back or I can go to this or you can just

765
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:22,039
feed the light and it goes oh thank you

766
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:24,918
so much good sir hold on hold on have

767

772
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:44,150
an amazing experience just these past

773
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,740
couple years you know

774
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:48,710
he's passed like three years they've

775
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:52,009
just been like mind-blowing for sure we

776
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:53,329
never we you know what I mean and where

777
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:55,250
is it gonna go from here

778
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:57,349
not in a million years three years ago

779
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,969
yeah we do have thought that right now

780
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:02,719
you'd be sitting here this is what be

781
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:04,909
going like you know ya know you know we

782
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,619
were about to sell our property we were

783
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:08,929
we were selling our property and then we

784
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:11,779
won the Emerald cup and we were like

785
00:35:08,929 --> 00:35:14,210
fuck now I'm supposed to stop

786
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,830
we were about to you know we were gonna

787
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:17,809
give and then my I'm like I'm gonna give

788
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:22,759
up now so we took that as a sign and

789
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:26,719
then I that was 2017 we took third in

790
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:29,200
light up with our you know 13 whatever

791
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:32,569
decade old soil you know with just water

792
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:35,960
you know with one compost tea water and

793
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:37,880
like one super light top dress and I was

794
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,099
just really like trusting the process

795
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,920
that's what that's what was it that's

796
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:45,889
what one is the process the methodology

797
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,710
the soil the bacteria the funk that's

798
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:50,690
what you know by trusting them that's

799
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,789
what they produces the highest quality

800
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:56,329
you know so for the least amount of

801
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:58,429
money you know so most consistently and

802
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:00,319
and I've been anybody to and I've been

803
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:02,960
able to hit my you know 50 pounds per

804
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,140
thousand square feet on have you done

805
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,639
testing like I go like 250

806
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:09,639
like a hundred fifty bucks

807
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:18,279
well in 2017 it's not in 2017 when we

808
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:21,430
wanted to see if we had what it took to

809
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,410
stay in the game so we doubled our

810
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:27,009
production cutter cost in the half in

811
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:29,649
half and then won you know 2/3 in like

812
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:33,490
that in the Emerald cup so we were like

813
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:35,800
okay I guess let's keep going and and we

814
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:38,889
were testing out at like 30 29 to 30

815
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,950
percent consistently 28 to 30 percent

816
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:46,598
with our so Jesus silver oh gee that's

817
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:49,179
earful total cannabinoids like they're

818
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:52,000
about 29 to 30 I've been holding spring

819
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:55,139
yes oh and then we took the third at the

820
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,210
weed con this year

821
00:36:55,139 --> 00:37:00,379
we were in the harvest box for organic

822
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:02,940
farming in Spring Creek Farm

823
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,980
yeah we're Sonoma County where Sonoma

824
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:08,789
County's oldest living soil brand and

825
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:11,610
like that technically I think you know

826
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:15,300
because we've been it's a funny one that

827
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:18,780
it kind of gauges your growth right have

828
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:23,240
you when you go out there at night juicy

829
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:27,150
worms cutting around on the surface Hey

830
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:28,559
like they come out to play what you go

831
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,990
home and go to bed they're still out

832
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,269
working like you know it's a kindly love

833
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:35,789
spending time in the dark in my

834
00:37:33,269 --> 00:37:40,320
greenhouse I'm really like addicted to

835
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:42,029
that tree and with the green light the

836
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,890
green light I have a you know I had that

837
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:46,800
with the green light and I'll just hang

838
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:50,960
in there and just I did the vibes are

839
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,960
just have you heard of method seven

840
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:59,269
they make these lenses that they

841
00:37:56,929 --> 00:38:01,639
literally were designed scientifically

842
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:04,820
because a man was tired of seeing his

843
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:07,730
friends go wrong lines and he knew about

844
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:10,430
filters he was a photographer I like

845
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:11,869
visually going blind Oh from right he

846
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:13,549
was going back to these girls

847
00:38:11,869 --> 00:38:14,900
year after year and he's like what's

848
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,789
going on with George

849
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:21,769
people are getting blinds in the indoor

850
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:23,960
and so like it changes how you see

851
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:25,849
things right and so now they've

852
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,070
developed it enough that you can put

853
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:30,440
these glasses on and it can be purple or

854
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:33,230
HPS orange or you know there and it's

855
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:37,099
like walking out in the garden it's

856
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:38,990
amazing and more people need to remember

857
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:41,090
that that's where plants grow and I

858
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:44,750
think it'll change the industry

859
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:46,610
right that if you remember that plants

860
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:49,059
go out in the garden it's just that

861
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:49,059
mindset

862
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:55,680
I'm not sure how to use this if you

863
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:55,679

873
00:39:33,798 --> 00:39:40,788
functional actually it's a bottle opener

874
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:43,549

882
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:02,419
like a handle you could put like

[Music]

904
00:41:07,088 --> 00:41:13,130
yeah when it's in steamroller Road

905
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:15,710
steamroller mode yeah it's like it'll in

906
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:26,750
its heart really hard why I thought what

907
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:28,949
you said it he took it the steamroller

908
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:32,230
mode

909
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:34,088
you know I won't go steamroller mode so

910
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:37,088
I want to hear about the safety though

911
00:41:34,088 --> 00:41:41,170
and how you choke the car button or

912
00:41:37,088 --> 00:41:43,779
however it works you know if I remove

913
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:47,740
the end you know and you just use it as

914
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:52,210
a steamroller you know like you know

915
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:56,348
what I mean but I just usually roll with

916
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:59,588
it like direct drive it's just safer you

917
00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:00,550
know in public it's safer in public like

918
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:03,279
that you know what I mean

919
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:07,690
I don't want to fuck somebody up too bad

920
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:11,099
that be like fucking kill somebody you

921
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:15,818
know I'm looking at trying to find a I

922
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:18,190
need more volume and I don't do constant

923
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:20,170
you know what I mean more volume I'm

924
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:25,450
thinking like vaporizing it's like I do

925
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:28,059
just flower you know yeah but I don't

926
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:30,730
like Dirty Pair wait let me let me put

uh let me put a chunk on it that's how

928
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:34,289
it gets going there you go

929
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,910
so you you've been on this property for

930
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:45,809
18 years you've said no I've been there

931

are gonna come out 14 years I guess the

936
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:04,590
return on investment thing oh yeah about

937
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:07,410
30 Nia working the year as you were

938
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:10,530
saying that because of how you cared for

939
00:43:07,409 --> 00:43:14,119
your lands you spent a hundred and fifty

940
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:15,269
dollars that's what you the cost yeah

941
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:16,679
250

942
00:43:15,269 --> 00:43:18,900
yeah and that's when I was buying stuff

943
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:20,009
this year I didn't spend anything except

944
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,900
from brown sugar

945
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:24,900
I don't why Brown shit I don't be a

946
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:28,380
jeweler I don't do that Alondra Dom I'm

947
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:30,389
not doing like an INF K&amp;F is like that's

948
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:34,170
the difference like ANF is like sugar

949
00:43:30,389 --> 00:43:36,989
right the DOM is more protein based okay

950
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:39,570
K and F is more sugar right right focus

951
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:42,500
well just warm gets it out of bacterial

952
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:45,480
down versus e more complex

953
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:48,840
protein is more protein at least break

954
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,929
fast complex white stinkier whereas KN f

955
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:54,390
is like sweeter smelling which you know

956
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:57,509
can draw bugs in there in the spring

957
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:59,849
I'll I'm just I'm not right by sugar and

958
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,650
in springtime I mean cars it's like I

959
00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:04,170
have to go by she where's the sugar

960
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:06,869
I don't waste it on my property right do

961
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:07,990
I fix your bags of sugar go get me some

962
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:11,440
sugar right

963
00:44:07,989 --> 00:44:15,789

964
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:19,059

965
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:21,670
kind of who I am anyway so you know the

966
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:24,940
jus Dom stuff a methodology really

967
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:27,849
I already what I've I'm very vocal about

968
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:29,858
about how I operate okay very cool boys

969
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:32,769
you know right like that's why I say I

970
00:44:29,858 --> 00:44:34,630
do like a no-till nothing style I heard

971
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:37,059
it you know I'm not like nothing I'm not

972
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,858
like no-till trying right you know

973
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:40,630
there's like there's like you can do

974
00:44:38,858 --> 00:44:42,549
no-till but then you're like doing it

975
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,650
yeah if you're doing anything then

976
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,450
you're like doing it but you don't want

977
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:50,230
to do it you're trying to not do it

978
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:51,460
right between not doing it and like not

979
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:54,099
not doing it

980
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:56,500
there's doing it I totally get what a

981
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:58,690
sign but because you're not it's a fine

982
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,699
dicking around with your plan right

983
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,920
you're feeding you're focused you're

984
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:05,139
being so efficient effective that it's

985
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,210
you know yeah it might look like I'm not

986
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:09,699
doing anything but that's not what I'm

987
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:11,170
doing I'm totally doing some shit but

988
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:12,608
some shits going I'm just doing the

989
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:15,909
right it's just gonna take three months

990
00:45:12,608 --> 00:45:18,159
for you to really see it indirectly you

991
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:20,379
know because the plants now we're not

992
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:24,190
operators like the turtle right you know

993
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:25,900
the rabbit in the end and the lower you

994
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:28,389
know and then plants yeah

995
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,639
please be it's a different rhythm right

996
00:45:28,389 --> 00:45:32,889
you know what I mean yeah there's like

997
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:34,719
the the rabbit the turtle at the

998
00:45:32,889 --> 00:45:37,329
tortoise and then a plant speed so then

999
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:38,559
but the plant just like beats the rabbit

1000
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:41,049
because it just connects into the

1001
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,000
mycelial network and pops up here the

1002
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:45,490
plant can do it all you kind of play a

1003
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,519
ball not even moving it's like boom and

1004
00:45:45,489 --> 00:45:50,439
nothing even changes they mean nothing

1005
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:54,039
even happened practically it's like

1006
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:56,200
magic you wake up one day and you're

1007
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:58,230
like wow plants are that matter that's

1008
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:01,929
growing really well yeah

1009
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:04,210

just you know it's like sometimes we'll

1059
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,719
have like no Sun for six weeks because

1060
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:12,539
there's a fire and we have to affect you

1061
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:15,480
know so I'll need to supplement I'll use

1062
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:18,989
I'll use my HPS because I mean I got

1063
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:23,010
them and it's not ideal I know sorry I

1064
00:48:18,989 --> 00:48:25,019
paid like 300 bucks for you know all of

1065
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:27,930
them and you know as somebody shutting

1066
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:30,599
down that it worked for me hey you know

1067
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:32,730
it's not ideal I don't feel that is your

1068
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:35,099
plant it helps me stay in business you

1069
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:38,190
know if you know that's about the worst

1070
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:41,429
thing that I do is use some HPS you know

1071
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:43,110
what I mean you have blessed soil and

1072
00:48:41,429 --> 00:48:44,849
compress it along that's about the worst

1073
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:48,180
thing they do for real I give it more

1074
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:50,539
light when there's no lights yeah when

1075
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:53,190
there's like no light I up lament it

1076
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:55,739
maybe I'll hit it a little bit and you

1077
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:57,210
know finish it with at the end just to

1078
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:59,129
pop off but it really doesn't they

1079
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:01,470
really hate the spectrum honestly the

1080
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:03,930
plants literally tell me I hate this

1081
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:06,299
spectrum I'm like I know I'm sorry

1082
00:49:03,929 --> 00:49:09,389
that's what I got I'm Rick I'd hate it

1083
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:11,390
too it's not good for your eyes it's not

1084
00:49:09,389 --> 00:49:15,000
good for our eyes it's not good for you

1085
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:16,980
I'm doing the best I can as I can if I

1086
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,719
if the banks would just if the fucking

1087
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,219
if I could just get a loan from the

1088
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:21,659
banks would just you know if we can just

1089
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:23,819
figure out this fucking banking thing

1090
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:26,009
and I can just solve it yes you know get

1091
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:28,580
the LED lighting that I need instead of

1092
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:31,800
having to do pay some stupid high I know

1093
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:34,409
rate just to get like the basic lighting

1094
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,940
I need which is like the most important

1095
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:38,460
tool when you're a grower it's like

1096
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:41,070
doing finished carpentry with a fucking

1097
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,039
piece of shit saw you found on the side

1098
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:46,059
of the road

1099
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:49,539
you know liking within fucking soft and

1100
00:49:46,059 --> 00:49:52,019
still making it look cool there and

1101
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:54,670
still making it look like it grew there

1102
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:55,809
because that's what at it that's what

1103
00:49:54,670 --> 00:50:01,090
it's that's what's up

1104
00:49:55,809 --> 00:50:04,210
I don't know that's what I know I just

1105
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:07,120
rollin we just know I just we rolled 150

1106
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:10,510
joints and we're just like gonna smoke

1107
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:12,789
everybody the fuck out just like that's

1108
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,680
it you know what I mean I just didn't

1109
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:17,170
even I don't know I was just so busy

1110
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:21,279
doing stuff I couldn't even like get to

1111
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:23,889
town to really enter and I don't know I

1112
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:27,010
probably should have because this mimosa

1113
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:29,859
actually is like that what this is no

1114
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:31,870

that you guys rolled yeah these those

1116

1117
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:43,509

strong it's just like freestanding more

1135
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:46,839
indica style didn't need any trellising

1136
00:51:44,588 --> 00:51:48,909
basically it held its own

1137
00:51:46,838 --> 00:51:51,759
yeah some of it wasn't even trellis it

1138

have just not done it where the 24 K had

1141
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:02,108
like three layers of trellising was

1142
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:04,210
falling apart all over the place like

1143
00:52:02,108 --> 00:52:06,579
every whichaway 15 pounds from that

1144
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:08,710

1180
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:52,800
hundred percent necessary for all of us

1181
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,870
it is that's why you know I don't want

out of the closet

1209
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:15,159
you know what I mean like it's it's not

1210
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:17,920
having to be grown indoors it shifted

1211

the culture like even in I know like

1212
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,610
people who are doing yeah we're going to

1213
00:55:19,989 --> 00:55:23,529
what we're going back one time we're

1214
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,980
sitting into it yeah but it's in living

1215
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:26,560
soil

1216
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:28,300
yeah and it's changing the plants and

1217
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,190
it's helping the Kim we're going back in

1218
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:32,140
time to move forward yeah a hundred

1219
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:34,630
percent of water levels I mean that's

1220
00:55:32,139 --> 00:55:37,650
been said many times lately yeah

1221
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:42,990
it's really I agree unnecessary you know

1222
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:42,990
methodology the mindset to focus on
