2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,240
so within the county we have the

3
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:22,500
unincorporated areas which make up

4
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,268
population about a million essentially

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,149
it becomes the fourth largest city in

6
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:28,919
the entire state of California and the

7
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:33,750
issue behind that is that the Board of

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,890
Supervisors have they've already said

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,390
that their number one goal is to

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,950
transition operators to a regulated

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,149
market so when you're doing the math

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,710
behind it and the current

13
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,320
recommendations they have for zoning

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,750
which is indoor cultivation only and

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,100
that retail and all the other kinds of

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,250
license sites will have to be within

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,350
commercial or manufacturing zones when

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,840
all that adds up to only one percent of

19
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,129
the county's territory I don't know how

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,559
they will be successful in able to

21
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:00,869
transfer you know to bring people over

22
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,099
for you to a regulated market so again

23
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:03,899
with the math on there you're looking at

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,849
it the unincorporated areas have a

25
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,150
grizzle agricultural zone land and that

26
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:11,368
makes up 39% of it and with that 39%

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,990
that they are not allowing a AG plant to

28
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:14,849
be able to cultivate on there I don't

29
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,259
see how they will be able to get rid of

30
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:18,539
the black market coming on there how

31
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,009
they're going to have to you know

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,299
transition people over it just won't be

33
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,400
successful if they do it this way so

34
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,689
with any luck we certainly see a lot of

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,740
hope that we can get that changed up

36
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:27,478
before they're gonna vote on their

37
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:29,489
regulations which is around December

38
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,200
January the conversations we've had so

39
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,868
far has been a bit of a miss education

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,670
where they had concerns over having

41
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:37,049
acres and acres and acres of cannabis

42
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,600
not recognizing the state has

43
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,860
limitations behind that so it's gonna be

44
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,269
just part of an education piece that

45
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:44,549
have them understand that you have them

46
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,408
acknowledging that the voters have voted

47
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,890
for this and they want it that works out

48
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,049
very well

49
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,040
however when at the same time they're

50
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,630
acknowledging that but in the same

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,460
breath they also say but I believe this

52
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:54,629
is a gateway drug it's a little hard to

53
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:55,859
them to kind of wrap everything around

54
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,218
you wonder where the sincerity is on

55
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,688
that and we tried to ask where is that

56
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:02,789
where their facts coming from and their

57
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:04,919
response is that I have a doctor friend

58
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,750
and my doctor friend told me so it's a

59
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,118
little frustrating again you know so

60
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,250
these supervisors I really do feel are

61
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,419
very sincere and want to get this done I

62
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,539
just don't think they understand the

63
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,399
entire dynamics

64
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:17,679
and if they plan to do something like a

65
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,510
phased approach that still will not help

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,829
and illicit markets gonna thrive from

67
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:22,328
there and they're not gonna be able to

68
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,439
transition those operators phase

69
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:24,790
approach to where they could say right

70
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:26,680
now we're only gonna allow endure and

71
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:27,938
then maybe in a year or two three

72
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,650
whatever it is I'll say hey let's open

73
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:32,438
this up now to actually do agricultural

74
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,180
zone lands so within the AG AG zone

75
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:35,560
itself they just have currently stated

76
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,750
that they recommend not having any

77
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,158
commercial cannabis activity of any sort

78
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:45,459
so where well absolutely it's already

79
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:46,750
been happening there well you know it's

80
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:48,430
I think I think it'd be more profitable

81
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,139
for them to do it that way than it is to

82
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,909
spend the resources towards regulating

83
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:53,200
people on it I feel very strong that we

84
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:55,658
have a very good opportunity to

85
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,158
influence that through this education so

86
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:59,168
you know with my position now with Anna

87
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:00,638
County on there with our efforts as the

88
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:02,349
organization in general with everyone

89
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,489
coming forward and kind of saying hey

90
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,869
look this is an opportunity you're

91
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:06,878
missing out on I do think they're gonna

92
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,469
realize that and in time for 2018

93
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,539
well the surprising thing is this you

94
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:11,859
know I had some of them reached out and

95
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:14,048
one of them was timing that they had

96
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:16,269
greenhouses everything ready to go and

97
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:17,709
their concern was that the county would

98
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:19,539
allow big business to come in and put

99
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,128
them out not even realizing that the

100
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:23,679
county is not allowing big business or

101
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:24,818
small business on AG land so you're I'm

102
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,919
getting more and more reports of people

103
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:28,958
that are setting up how this ready to go

104
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,099
however they have no realization that

105
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,810
the county has said sorry we're not

106
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:33,518
gonna allow this here so money is being

107
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,840
put into it and they're hoping to feed

108
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,340
their families and whatever goes from

109
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,539
there and yet they don't realize that

110
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,739
they're not gonna get to legally

111
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:40,739
participate in this new market

112
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:58,329
