1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,839
we're all working independently no one

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,660
person controls this industry as much as

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,580
they think they do and we're all small

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,280
participants that combined we make up a

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,798
big tool and it's just trying to figure

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,298
out how do you share technology and how

7
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:16,528
do you use what you use and how do we

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:18,989
make money off each other's stuff

9
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:21,778
because if you had a varietal that had a

10
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,549
demand and I was allowed to license it

11
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:24,868
through my nursery then I could provide

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,789
it to cultivators that could then

13
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:28,589
subsequently sell it which is what I'm

14
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,510
doing with with Vernon screw where we

15
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,039
know that the lemonade line is there

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,590
everything coming out of Martin Martin

17
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,079
has the 11 acre campus over in Oakland

18
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,030
so that massive facility that was the

19
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,890
old Naval Base the Safeway warehouses

20
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:49,049
that's that's all Martin stuff so you

21
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:50,399
met Martin Lee sitting there and and you

22
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,019
know and a lot of it is what we found

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,660
when we went into it was virally

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,180
contaminate virally contaminated so when

25
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,519
we did the first so the first project we

26
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,128
worked with on this was through Martin

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,780
as the R&amp;D because he said listen let me

28
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,969
work with the product cuz I can push it

29
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,739
through my facilities then I can move it

30
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,959
on the end zone but I'm having problems

31
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,640
with it so we go through and they say

32
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:13,408
well this is all virally contaminated

33
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,989
which a lot of this stuff come in from

34
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,240
there is virally contaminated and then

35
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:20,459
so they scrub it and then so then Martin

36
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,719
runs side by side trials to be able to

37
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:23,219
say what are we looking at and the

38
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,900
difference between the two cultivars is

39
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:29,819
night day yeah you'd be banging because

40
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,350
it's got an ultra loud signature and

41
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:37,589
it's got a built in branding yeah yeah

42
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:39,899
yeah it's a lemon pine salt and and it

43
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,579
and unlike a lot of the mono tear up

44
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,579
lemons it holds it all the way through a

45
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:46,469
joint so it doesn't flare off so it has

46
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:49,438
a sesqui combination the sesquiterpene

47
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:51,840
combination Terps that don't flare up on

48
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,368
the heat more Multi bonds that's what

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,790
gives you the enjoyment after the first

50
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:56,129
hit

51
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,930
so people that small bongs of apes they

52
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:59,819
have a different situation than those

53
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,310
that actually burn it because the heat

54
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,688
is burning off that that complexity as

55
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,450
you go forward to what you're left with

56
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:08,609
is only heavily multi bond terpenes at

57
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,920
the end of it and the lemonade holds it

58
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,900
through the piece I'm just I'm just like

59
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,829
just like the perk I always wondered you

60
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,510
know when I was we were

61
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,490
moving perfectly crazy I was there pre /

62
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:19,649
when / nobody wanted hurt nobody wanted

63
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,120
black little pounds next thing you know

64
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,159
nobody wants anything but black little

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,659
pounds and so purple comes out and

66
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,340
actually wipes out most of the genetic

67
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:27,719
diversity in a lot of the California

68
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,150
because if you weren't moving / if you

69
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,310
weren't moving weed but what made / trip

70
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,870
was that there was that blunt revolution

71
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,909
that was occurring so the blunt was

72
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,770
coming out in full form and perf had a

73
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:39,299
high sesquiterpene combination that

74
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,310
allowed you to hold a flavor all to the

75
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,330
end and at that time cannabis was still

76
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,069
being flipped through the windows of

77
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,440
cars more than through storefronts and

78
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,689
when you looked at the baggie it had a

79
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:52,219
distinctive orange carrot looking hair

80
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:55,109
with a heavy purple tone but it was a

81
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:57,240
bright light royal purple it wasn't the

82
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,220
typical heavy purp of like a purple cush

83
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:03,000
even though it's related to purple cush

84
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:04,740
genealogically so purple cush is the all

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,689
these perps come through purple cush as

86
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,159
a progenitor because we can track it

87
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:10,199
genetically you can see the link on the

88
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,650
DNA line but it had a radically

89
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,539
different quality of mouth appeal and so

90
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,510
lo and behold it's recognizable in a bag

91
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:20,310
it holds in a blunt and it's great

92
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:21,509
kool-aid and at the time most of the

93
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,949
ghettos the way that stuff was pushing

94
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:25,079
heavy and I'm from the hood on East

95
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:26,399
Coast and so great kool-aid is what we

96
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,030
all drank you didn't have multi flavor

97
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,830
kool-aid

98
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,560
and so lo and behold grape is popular

99
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,060
holds in a blunt recognizable in a deal

100
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,709
all of a sudden you have this magic

101
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,879
little trifecta of things that come

102
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:39,330
together to create a billion-dollar

103
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:41,669
variety and it's trying to put together

104
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,620
those same kind of combinations and so

105
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,409
now you have you know the the og but OGE

106
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,080
isn't gonna go anywhere because OG has

107
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:50,939
an incredible aside of branding it has

108
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,190
an exceptionally high impact because a

109
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,769
mere Cena is the anesthetic and it also

110
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,930
has an exceptional complexity within the

111
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,370
line where as you go through it people

112
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,010
are happy with it if you get a good

113
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,539
quality o gene you consume it pretty

114
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,669
much you really don't have a high

115
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:06,989
ceiling to it every time you smoke it

116
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:09,059
you get a very similar effect than

117
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,500
you're happy as well this one of the OGS

118
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,769
it's really not a diluted watered-down

119
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,180
and even and even though the the the old

120
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:16,918
oh geez the originals were running

121
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,509
around seventeen eighteen percent when

122
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,529
you scope them with me and Josh were

123
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:23,550
talking in in Carpinteria and I said he

124
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:27,149
came to the lecture I gave in

125
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:33,780
Carpinteria about genetic mapping so

126
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:36,899
two months ago month enough yes so we

127
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:37,619
went to that oh it was you yeah yeah yes

128
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:39,870
got aggressive

129
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,180
yeah and study granola yeah and so and

130
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,780
so and then you had then you had Steve

131
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,699
Cantwell from the the no-till right yeah

132
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:50,039
and so they asked me to come in to kind

133
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,478
of tie the package together and then to

134
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,580
say look this is where you're gonna go

135
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:55,199
with all these technologies and so you

136
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:57,418
come in with your supplemental

137
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,699
greenhouses and then you come in with

138
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:01,049
the no-till situation where you're

139
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,910
getting biological because really the

140
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,710
cost of production is low once you're

141
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:08,840
able to get this biological circle

142
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:11,099
completed and Cantwell's doing killer in

143
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,239
Vegas with his no-till operations

144
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,220
because he's not losing any of the

145
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,750
product and having to blow it and then

146
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,000
you got Scottie granola doing your

147
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,800
predicated of testing to say listen when

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,168
I see microbe levels here

149
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,509
I know problems are about to be present

150
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:25,529
there and so even though and he's one of

151
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,418
the laning I'm just like you know

152
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:29,459
disciples and Elaine says you can't use

153
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:32,038
science to predict but you kind of can

154
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,899
and so even though it's true scientists

155
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,199
won't do that because scientists did

156
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:38,549
study not prediction you can make some

157
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,180
pretty good goddamn predictions based

158
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,069
off of the science yeah it lets you

159
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,889
allow it and we'll and I like it because

160
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:50,129
it creates the warning situations and

161
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:53,639
you got you got and Scott sharp and he's

162
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:55,110
a intelligent guy who is involved most

163
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,400
definitely with cultivators and a lot of

164
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,410
these people coming in aren't involved

165
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,448
in cannabis production cannabis cannabis

166
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,070
sourcing the aloe vera part is what are

167
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:04,139
you guys using it for we're using it and

168
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:07,889
we are using aloe vera in terms of

169
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:17,819
wetting agents yeah yeah wetting agents

170
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:19,650
yep but the yeah the but the effect is

171
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,680
phenomenal because what we know is that

172
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:24,239
really numeira have I was messing around

173
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,590
with gene from me and gene from

174
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,019
Mendocino right so me and Gina buddies

175
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:31,259
and so he lets me access his cherry line

176
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:33,329
but it says it is but I have the line

177
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,978
males to but I mean the the cherry that

178
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:36,689
he uses in the lime and he says hey

179
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,668
listen here's the seed stock just don't

180
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,740
let it out because it's it's it is my

181
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:42,719
shit so it'll it'll sense

182
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,340
somebody right into my lines and so I

183
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,710
said sweet so I'll work with it I'll use

184
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,689
it as progeny to stock for breeding so I

185
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:51,089
pull out a cutting of it that it's just

186
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:52,918
this cherry is one could humanly hope

187
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:55,019
for it comes out of like eleven and a

188
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,418
half twelve percent but I found that

189
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:59,008
it's perfect for people that let's go we

190
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:01,139
enjoy I like I like something a little

191
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,750
more power to it but in terms of the

192
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,030
quality the fact it's just resonates but

193
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,038
it lets me use it for my girlfriend and

194
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:10,109
for my buddies that can't smoke high

195
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,029
potency devastating cannabis because

196
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,580
they're able to get the effect they want

197
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:17,339
and not get blasted off the top of his

198
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:19,978
shoes and I get it because the flavor

199
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:23,189
profile is fantastic and so I was

200
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:24,899
talking to Josh we met at carbonaria and

201
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:26,550
we were talking about and I didn't who

202
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,799
he wasn't we first met so we just meet

203
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,419
each other we're talking about numerix

204
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,800
and we started talking about old oh geez

205
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:33,870
and I didn't know who he was at the time

206
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,020
and I said all my old oh geez that I got

207
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:39,478
from an NGO from you know like late 90s

208
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:41,008
they're all coming in around you know 17

209
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,529
18 points that's what he said he goes

210
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:45,870
yeah he goes he said my stuff is coming

211
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:48,029
in never over 20 he said I've never hit

212
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:53,639
over 20 with my foundation stock and

213
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:55,679
then I have and then I have I and so

214
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,110
well you we can we can we can tweak it

215
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,900
because we can drive our humidity levels

216
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,968
far down and I can get a higher trichome

217
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,069
density and I can also dry the plant

218
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:06,658
Warren and depending on what lab I use I

219
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,968
can make these numbers but if I'm

220
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:12,060
looking at it free period of time and I

221
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:13,680
see the graph I say whoa that's a panga

222
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,329
cup that I picked up from Mandal and

223
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,280
then that we called the SME cut those

224
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,689
two lemon lime that the two bookends of

225
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,799
what he thought oh gee word that he got

226
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:29,519
probably out of you guys at that time

227
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:30,810
yes yes Douglas sister Linda Banga no

228
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,059
but it works killer for hybridization

229
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:36,028
for outdoor because it has a it has a

230
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:38,338
faster trigger yeah yeah yeah yep yep

231
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:40,860
yeah it's a faster trigger outside so we

232
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,539
use it in breeding projects to upgrade

233
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,490
what we want is what we call fuel

234
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:46,379
designations but with a faster of

235
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,789
trigger time because if I can get the oh

236
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,470
if I can get the og to come in around

237
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:51,539
that first week of October versus the

238
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,950
third week of October I'm killing it cuz

239
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:57,159
I got two weeks to process and get

240
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,420
into the market and so he and I were

241
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,589
chatting about and he goes yeah so he

242
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:02,019
gave me some of the stuff that he had

243
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,700
grown he goes hey this is all stuff for

244
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:06,189
my my original stuff and he goes and I

245
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,750
never get over 20 with this one and so

246
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,340
we started talking about all this all

247
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,350
the swings because now we're looking at

248
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:15,100
oh jeans that are in thirty twos but

249
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,300
that's all self then selected out but

250
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,399
that's where you start to see such a

251
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:25,889
huge propensity for p.m. problems

252
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:28,059
pathogenic issues by relations totally

253
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:41,319
no no because it's it's it's a

254
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:49,239
foundation line yeah you keep any kind

255
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:50,230
of any kind of it yet and that's what ya

256
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,940
know it's that it doesn't make it

257
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,159
profitable for you and if you make any

258
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,960
mistakes at all I'm doing I'm doing this

259
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,339
old reservation skunk project so I've

260
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,379
been collecting skunk from around the

261
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:04,000
world that's from the early eighties me

262
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:05,799
too you know the chunks and I want to

263
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,210
see the range in tones and they all got

264
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,889
wiped out because there was no chaco

265
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,139
filtration so I used to run these hot

266
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:12,850
operations using ozone technology I used

267
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:13,960
to get from hospitals so I went into the

268
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,790
hospital said how do you guys clean up

269
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,860
your shit and they said they use ozone

270
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:19,480
so there was a company in Texas saunas

271
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,860
here that was a commercial ozone company

272
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,750
and I would bring in the ozone tech and

273
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,149
I would blow all my ducts and vents as I

274
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,649
vented her modernes houses yeah because

275
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:27,639
if you let it if you let the ozone in

276
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:32,529
the room if you'd wipe out all the

277
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:37,960
plants yeah yeah yeah you haven't gave

278
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:39,879
it your everything possible yeah yeah

279
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,810
kill the grass though yeah one look

280
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:45,879
awesome yeah and so and so we we end up

281
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,199
wiping out these skunk situations and

282
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,059
then and there's a smoke around I'm

283
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,410
getting bored right I mean I'm smoking

284
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:51,969
everything on the fucking planet I'm

285
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:54,069
getting bored and I said you know what I

286
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,769
wanted something from the past that had

287
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,180
been selected as smoke for generations

288
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:59,259
from people from other countries and

289
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:00,819
then put together these of these

290
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:04,659
varietals and I said well how do I

291
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:07,360
access it so I started going into crews

292
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:09,698
over in Europe that the stock

293
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,230
had left northern Northern California in

294
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:13,778
the 80s and went over to Europe for

295
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,428
holding and then I was able to mine it

296
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:17,528
back so they would ship it back to me

297
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:19,509
from Europe and then I started doing

298
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:21,458
some recovery work for people that had

299
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:23,259
old stock that they had kept forever and

300
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,099
they were having pathogenic issues and

301
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:25,509
they couldn't get it and they said

302
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,759
listen we we don't want to give it up

303
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:29,289
but we're gonna lose the varietal if we

304
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,678
give it to you would you clean it and

305
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,998
then you can play with it and so it

306
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:36,009
started letting me get into these skunks

307
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:37,480
so I go set up to do a whole breeding

308
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:39,899
project and I get ready to do all my

309
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,899
work
