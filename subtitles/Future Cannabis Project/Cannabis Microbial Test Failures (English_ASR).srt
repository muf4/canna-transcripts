[Music]

2
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:15,029
there's a fight on this one

3
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,399
in terms of interpretation of what is

4
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:19,649
microbial progress and so microbial is a

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,419
living organisms of fungus it bacteria

6
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,339
that live on the surface of basically

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,650
everything now some of these things are

8
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,089
deadly like e.coli so things like e.coli

9
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,399
which we test for on cannabis we want to

10
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:32,579
see none but what we're having problems

11
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:35,339
with is having East issues and East is

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,739
something that is present in it's really

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,079
present if you're using enzymatic scuzz

14
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:41,939
enzymatic SAR using yeast to do the work

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,100
and so for a lot of people who used

16
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,019
enzymatic sit invalidated the cannabis

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,570
for a lot of people like me who use

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,180
compost tea it has ability didn't

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,020
validate your cannabis and so what we're

20
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:56,308
trying to understand is how does one

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,620
take a look at other agricultural

22
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:00,149
industries that use organic

23
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:02,339
methodologies and find safe working

24
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,019
levels for these things and so the state

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,609
of California standards are actually

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,270
pretty good and they're pretty

27
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:11,368
reasonable and what you have is you had

28
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,688
new standards get brought in they call

29
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:15,269
them the Berkeley standards and those

30
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:17,609
standards are based more on a conceptual

31
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:20,158
purity and what it does is it basically

32
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:22,769
renders probably 95% of the Sun grown

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,600
market red out of existence and there's

34
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:26,579
this belief that these this yeast must

35
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:29,250
be it must be terrible for you but it's

36
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:32,400
on every single piece of organic fruit

37
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,019
vegetable herb that you buy so you've

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,430
been consuming tons of it your entire

39
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:38,859
existence with never any issues

40
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,530
and so what you're having is you're

41
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:44,109
having companies that are looking to

42
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:48,340
generate more testing requirements to

43
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:50,109
benefit the companies versus individuals

44
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,670
trying to create standards that makes

45
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:53,650
sense for production models and I think

46
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,820
the California will actually do a pretty

47
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,040
good job with this I think they're gonna

48
00:01:54,819 --> 00:02:00,789
take a look at this and realize that you

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,620
can't put a zero living tissue count

50
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:06,850
where there's nothing on the plant from

51
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:10,149
an outside plant growing the Sun and it

52
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:11,709
favors an organic model or favors an

53
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:13,180
indoor model heavily because we can

54
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:14,469
completely control everything but the

55
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,230
problem is does that mean that that's

56
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:19,330
really real does one need to have

57
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:22,509
sterility on a product as any of my

58
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,670
other agricultural products sterile no

59
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,560
so the only thing we're talking about

60
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:28,000
sterility on is cannabis and so it

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,259
doesn't really hold suit I hold suit

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,209
that somebody's gonna make money on a

63
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:33,039
standard and I think that that's really

64
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:34,450
how you have to look at this it's such

65
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,150
an issue that when we did the golden

66
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:40,389
tarp this year we change the microbials

67
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,819
to where it reflects the California not

68
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:44,289
the Berkeley standards and we said

69
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:45,789
listen these are the things that we're

70
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,689
gonna work with we're numbers that make

71
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:50,159
sense

72
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:51,659
it's a toxic component like you call I

73
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,569
know it's not allowed but on some of

74
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:55,650
these yeasts and molds that are

75
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:56,759
prohibiting organic cultivators from

76
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,560
getting their products and it's only

77
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,409
it's impossible to can see that that's

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,670
not healthy product so at the golden

79
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:04,799
time what we did is we change the

80
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:06,899
requirements so that we're able to

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,150
really focus on that sun-grown sector

82
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,909
and once we start to have some

83
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,280
individuals who can interpret organic

84
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:15,359
methodologies correctly and explain it

85
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,340
to the people who are regulating

86
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,290
cannabis correctly when we'll have this

87
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,939
Saturday but in the meantime it's pretty

88
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:23,159
difficult so what we've done you know

89
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,719
here at the nursery was I went through a

90
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,030
tremendous number of plants that are

91
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:30,080
really tough they'll let me grow them

92
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,879
dry which means no fungal sprays and no

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,770
composting spreads and I really love

94
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,109
using compost teas on plants because it

95
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,510
just really boosts up the helping plant

96
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,640
overall but because of some of these

97
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:42,959
standards I dropped it way back I pulled

98
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,909
out a certain cultivars out of the

99
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,760
library that I know just come up hotter

100
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:50,609
and it's because if the Berkeley

101
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,169
standard is used it Bakley hit almost it

102
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,170
wipes out the you know the entire crop

103
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:56,729
and so these things just don't make any

104
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,359
sense because they're they don't reflect

105
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:01,689
reality

106
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,220
and that has to be addressed and I think

107
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:04,120
that the California regulators will and

108
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:07,750
I think that they'll do a pretty good

109
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,430
job I don't see the situation like other

110
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,250
states in the same way where they want a

111
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,990
favor a buffered into a model because

112
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,789
California has electrical problems that

113
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:19,449
are just out of control meaning no grid

114
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:22,000
capacity and who anywhere in the world

115
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:23,709
if you didn't grow it outside California

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,019
I mean if you can't grow it here were

117
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:27,969
you gonna grow so you have this

118
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:30,129
incredible opportunity to grow

119
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,610
efficiently effectively agriculturally

120
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:38,740
soundly once we start to rain in the

121
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:40,830
requirements for testing do you think do

122
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,990
you think that

123
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:45,240
it would be a good idea for some of

124
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,180
these people who are using compost

125
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,699
sprays and such to wash their cannabis

126
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,350
would that improve their ability to pass

127
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,500
some of these testing standards and then

128
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,930
of course keep super-clean trim

129
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,329
environments yeah you know I mean a lot

130
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,889
of year a lot of year a lot of your

131
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:03,870
yeast and mold is coming out of the dirt

132
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:12,329
so basically if we keep the dust down at

133
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:14,639
your property that helps a lot and the O

134
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:16,859
in terms of washing washing washing

135
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,439
possibility of Washington not with water

136
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,900
with with the hydrogen peroxide solution

137
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,370
we can use an h2o to solution that and

138
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:24,689
it's basically going to be like a it's

139
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,939
going to peel some of that surface

140
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,110
fungal off and it can take plants that

141
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,569
wouldn't have passed the make and pass

142
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,009
but the idea that your and wetting

143
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:33,540
cannabis before you harvest it isn't

144
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:36,269
terrible it's it's good to clean it off

145
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,629
a lot of times but to have to harvest an

146
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:41,370
entire entire crop and wash every flower

147
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:44,219
if it's maybe about a washing you're

148
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,139
doing here is ungodly and I'm like wait

149
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,050
a minute wait a minute and so it's it's

150
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,879
for people the strategy that we explain

151
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,620
this year a lot of people was let's get

152
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,719
into cultivars that don't require the

153
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,120
buffer let's get into cultivars that

154
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,100
don't require a lot of the microbial

155
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,439
assisters meaning things that you had

156
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,230
had to help you work with pathogenic

157
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:07,319
pressure and so it limited the number of

158
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,120
choices in the library to be used for

159
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,529
the cultivators that understood it they

160
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,720
were doing they found stuff that didn't

161
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:15,659
need any assistance and I did the same

162
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,670
thing now I had one plant that I ran as

163
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,680
a test and it came up too hot for

164
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,090
Berkeley so it would be able to move

165
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,100
under the California but not the

166
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,869
Berkeley standards and so that's one

167
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,820
that depending on if you're trying to

168
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,009
push it to a store that uses the

169
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,168
Berkeley then it would invalidate it so

170
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:34,199
I have to be able to kind of cattle

171
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:35,758
does what when and where and then it

172
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,249
lets me know can you use the tool

173
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,169
appropriately and so once we get this

174
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,819
reigned in reasonable legal open up a

175
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:44,008
tremendous number of cultivars again for

176
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,110
usage and it will allow us to really get

177
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:47,759
these biologically driven systems up to

178
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,439
spec to where they belong because you

179
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,960
have to have the biology on the surface

180
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,909
effort early in in the root zone and if

181
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:57,359
you can do this it works in concert to a

182
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:59,399
degree that's unbelievable and that just

183
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,330
has to be seen as non-harmful an

184
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:04,918
organically driven apple is pretty

185
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:06,449
healthy I don't see why I'm so afraid of

186
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,008
it and then with cannabis it should be

187
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,210
the same but because it's cannabis it's

188
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:11,430
looked at as something very different

189
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:13,438
and so cannabis being the single most

190
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:17,999
agriculturally regulated product in

191
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:19,560
human history who knows but what we know

192
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:20,969
is that I think California is going to

193
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,829
really look at these standards and rein

194
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:25,949
them into reality because if they don't

195
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:28,050
make any sense right so you think that

196
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:29,788
the not just the Berkeley standards but

197
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,800
the California standards need to be

198
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:32,038
adjusted California is actually not too

199
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,468
bad

200
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:37,019
Calif lung is not too bad where they're

201
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:38,430
saying in chloroform's on coal lies all

202
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:41,968
these things that you do not want to

203
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,468
have in your products zero but then on

204
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:44,699
euston moles it's an allowable and I

205
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:46,079
want to say it comes up to like maybe

206
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,490
four to five percent of the total weight

207
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,899
by volume you know total weight of the

208
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,408
product can exceed this so much of an

209
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:54,180
encounter and these are standards use

210
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:56,969
from other organic

211
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,459
I say certification industries agencies

212
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,740
for food production because you're

213
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,120
taking data from where see that's the

214
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,620
problem with a lot of canvases and

215
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,879
there's never been any Studies on it in

216
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,819
a way that lets us use any kind of

217
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,038
pesticide so the FDA epa none of these

218
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,538
people will certify anything so nothing

219
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:13,889
could ever be tested or used and

220
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:17,639
determined hey this is something that

221
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:19,470
used here this way is a safe for human

222
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,870
consumption we don't really have any of

223
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,729
that assistance and so the problem a lot

224
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,590
of us is trying to take information from

225
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:27,959
one industry interpret it and apply it

226
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,638
to another and depending on who is

227
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,930
teaching you this information are they

228
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,330
trying to teach you were they trying to

229
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,950
push an agenda and I just think that the

230
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,870
State of California's numbers really not

231
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,240
too bad and that with a little bit of

232
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,389
adjustment into reality that it'll it'll

233
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,700
be an accurate system and a safer so if

234
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:48,080
a farmer has cannabis it does test

235
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:52,860
positive for mold or mildew or yeast

236
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,500
what are their options concentrate yeah

237
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,850
you know concentrate in the Croods

238
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,440
distillates things that you're gonna do

239
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,820
an extract on or you can peel a lot of

240
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,370
that out I mean if it's too covered in

241
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,959
mold no but if it's if it's just east of

242
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,399
mold and stuff yeah you can blow it and

243
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,969
that those will come out in the

244
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:16,990
extraction process

245
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:16,990
