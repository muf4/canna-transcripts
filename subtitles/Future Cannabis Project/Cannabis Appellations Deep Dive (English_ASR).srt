1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,429
our keynote panel which focuses on the

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,290
proposed cannabis appellation program

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:09,710
itself and leading that discussion

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,910
tonight will be Jeannine Coleman

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,460
Jeannine Coleman is the founder and

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,070
executive director of origins Council a

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,278
non-profit education research and policy

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,960
advocacy organization so I'm going to go

9
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,390
ahead and get started and just offer a

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,420
brief overview of the proposed

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:31,278
regulations and then we'll open up into

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,600
more specific topics for discussion so

13
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,909
essentially the regulatory package

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,000
describes a system to establish an

15
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:40,828
appellation of origin and that process

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,320
is that farmers come together to

17
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,450
research and develop a petition to

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,308
propose an appellation and the

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,770
regulations propose a minimum of three

20
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:53,009
license cultivators come together to do

21
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,750
so and then the petition describes the

22
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,509
geographic boundaries of their proposed

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,570
appellation evidence of established name

24
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:03,030
use and geographic factors that

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,769
contribute to the inequalities of the

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,859
cannabis and the cannabis cultivation

27
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,260
and then any region specific standards

28
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:14,000
practices and cultivars then the

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:18,810
petition submitted to CDFI with a fee of

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,150
$20,000 880 and CFA proposes in the

31
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,049
regulations to appoint a volunteer

32
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,478
review panel consisting of seven members

33
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,549
with two alternates to review the

34
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:33,420
petition and provide recommendations to

35
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:36,118
see DFA and once the petition is

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,450
determined to be a complete CDFA will

37
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:42,359
notice a 30-day public comment period

38
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,049
and CDFA has the sole authority to

39
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,039
approve the appellation of origin

40
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:50,939
appellation petitions once established

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,469
can be amended and the proposed fee for

42
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,719
that is ten thousand four hundred and

43
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:59,399
forty dollars a couple of other

44
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:02,188
considerations in the regulations we

45
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,409
it's a little bit unclear whether or not

46
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:06,359
the appellation can be used on

47
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,399
manufactured products so that's a point

48
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,659
of clarification we're going to be

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,139
looking for

50
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,829
there's no labeling guidelines that are

51
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,139
provided

52
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,750
so that's another pretty significant

53
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,459
scope of clarification that we need the

54
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,500
regulations proposed allowing for

55
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,310
partially overlapping Appalachians as

56
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,319
well as nested Appalachians and Richard

57
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,629
spoke a little bit to the potential

58
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,879
friction between trademarks and

59
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,710
appellation of origin and the

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,560
regulations proposed a three year sunset

61
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:40,320
period for Geographic trademarks that

62
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,689
would be in conflict with an appellation

63
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,699
of origin with that timeline beginning

64
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:47,819
once the appellation of origin has been

65
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,939
established on the verification and

66
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:52,439
enforcement side of things the proposal

67
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:53,520
is to essentially handle those

68
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,569
requirements solely through

69
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,820
record-keeping and then the defines for

70
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:03,299
misuse are very minor and ranged from

71
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:07,109
$100 to $500 so that's just a general

72
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,270
picture of the regulatory package and I

73
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,190
think to start us off what I would like

74
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,680
to do is ask Richard if you wouldn't

75
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:16,919
mind walking us through the specific

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,230
petition requirements and explain how

77
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:24,000
that is important with respect to the

78
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:26,909
causal link okay so these proposed

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,629
regulations they're in the California

80
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:33,269
Code of regulations title 3 division 8

81
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:35,310
chapter 1 and specifically the

82
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:41,670
requirements for a petition are in

83
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:44,159
sections 9 102 9 1 0 7 and it's pretty

84
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:47,488
self-explanatory I'll just review that

85
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,009
briefly first of all the general

86
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,980
information is set forth in 9 102 and

87
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:56,429
you have to describe who you are your

88
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:58,079
license number contact information you

89
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,409
have to give a general description of

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,830
the area which would be the total

91
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:07,169
acreage the acreage under canopy and the

92
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,300
acreage of the of that total the amount

93
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:12,329
which would qualify for use of the

94
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:16,350
appellation so give them the the sense

95
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:18,299
of proportion at the outset and then we

96
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,879
get into the specifics that are going to

97
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:24,139
look a lot like what I showed you for an

98
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:26,909
ABA with one notable exception named

99
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,360
boundary distinctive geographical

100
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,939
feature

101
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,218
which looks like a navy a style

102
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:35,819
requirements and then your standards

103
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:40,800
practices and cultivars so let's run

104
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:42,900
through those specifically the regs give

105
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,949
some guidance into the types of

106
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:49,318
information that would be acceptable and

107
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:54,000
of course all this is subject to review

108
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:56,218
by CDFA and they will tell you just as

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,649
ttv tells you with a navy a petition

110
00:04:56,218 --> 00:05:01,528
whether you are quote-unquote perfected

111
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:04,318
whether you've met the original of an

112
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:08,028
injury burden in order to get yourself

113
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:11,218
into rulemaking so the name in nine 104

114
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:14,968
is is pretty straightforward the name

115
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:16,740
has to relate to the boundary it doesn't

116
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:19,740
say in the regs whether the name can be

117
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,150
under inclusive or over inclusive it

118
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:26,908
just says that you can use among

119
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:29,549
numerous information sources to justify

120
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:32,759
the name so the name doesn't have to be

121
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:36,629
a name that's been known in the world of

122
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,490
cannabis or for cannabis the name can be

123
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,710
a governmental name it can be a school

124
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,509
district it can be a road it can be a

125
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:46,198
mountain name it can be the names of

126
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:51,750
businesses it can be in the media can be

127
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:54,990
used in tourism so what the petitioners

128
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,870
will have to do is to bring all of those

129
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:01,168
sources of information together in their

130
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,228
petition to justify that the name

131
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:05,878
applies to the given boundary obviously

132
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:09,538
even though it's not stated in the

133
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,370
regulations if the name is misleading if

134
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:14,550
I were sitting here in Napa and calling

135
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,439
myself Berkeley well I consumer is not

136
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:20,250
going to understand that but no matter

137
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:22,740
what information I adduce so the name

138
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:26,639
has to be understandable to the

139
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,930
consumers then you go to 9 105 which is

140
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,838
the boundary you have to have a

141
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,389
narrative description again it looks

142
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:38,069
like a lot light with TTB rules for ABA

143
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:40,710
su you describe it in a clockwise manner

144
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:42,390
you know starting at the beginning point

145
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:45,089
going clockwise and ending at the same

146
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:47,490
point and you can use any features that

147
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:51,629
appear on a map and they give you

148
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:53,910
examples of that that might be human

149
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:57,569
features human construction features

150
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:59,910
like a bridge it could be natural

151
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:03,240
features like an elevation or a mountain

152
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:06,540
peak or a road or a river

153
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,480
it does not say but I presume it means

154
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,790
the regulations mean that you're not

155
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,470
doing this by parcel lines it's not my

156
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,970
property but not my neighborhood's

157
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:19,470
property as to finding meets and bounds

158
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:22,230
so again I think it looks pretty much

159
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:25,470
like the same kind of information that

160
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:29,250
you would do for a for an ABA petition

161
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:31,140
in nine 106 we get to the most

162
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,850
interesting part of the regulations and

163
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,819
where the causal link comes in Jeanine

164
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,070
and that is the issue of what they call

165
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,920
distinctive geographical features in the

166
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:42,980
regs and geographical features it stated

167
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,270
in the initial statement of reasons

168
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,970
include cultural factors and

169
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:51,049
reputational factors it's not just the

170
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:53,730
natural to bringing in what they call

171
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,780
anthropogenic features cultivation

172
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:59,790
practices and the why so it's a

173
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:01,949
geographical features in the broadest

174
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,530
sense of the word

175
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:07,009
and they they ask for those features

176
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:08,909
that affect cannabis cultivation I

177
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:10,860
personally have a problem with that

178
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,960
because it it should be that affects

179
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,629
cannabis not it affects cannabis

180
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,519
cultivation the test of any GDI or

181
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:20,430
appellation of origin is the final

182
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,680
product how you grow it is essential

183
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,290
that's a standard practice in cultivar

184
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,420
but ultimately the geographical features

185
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:31,560
have to relate and this is your causal

186
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:34,700
linked to the final product whether it's

187
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:39,350
a natural feature as they call out here

188
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:43,770
climate physical features elevations

189
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:47,070
geology no mention of soil which should

190
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:49,860
be in there and then and then how it

191
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:54,150
relates to the final product and then

192
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,029
they also include reputation history of

193
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,449
the area

194
00:08:55,029 --> 00:09:01,750
Automation practices so what that means

195
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,580
is that you have to show not just that

196
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,750
the region is distinctive compared to

197
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:10,270
what's outside um you have to show that

198
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,970
what makes it distinctive affects the

199
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:17,110
final product when you add up the sum

200
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:19,149
total of the of the geography the

201
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,190
geographical features and the standards

202
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:24,329
practices and cultivars that that

203
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,740
equation will lead to those special

204
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,259
distinctive characteristics and

205
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,330
qualities of the final product that's

206
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:33,730
the burden of the petitioners to do

207
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,170
that's why the petitioners three or more

208
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,389
are going to get together and

209
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:40,539
collaborate you know how do we prove

210
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:43,539
this that our cannabis really is

211
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:49,449
distinctive in this area and then of

212
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:51,939
course they want you to enumerate what

213
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:55,810
those standards practices and cultivars

214
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,670
are interestingly the practice can be a

215
00:09:55,809 --> 00:10:01,029
prohibited practice as well as a

216
00:09:57,669 --> 00:10:05,289
prescriptive practice the cultivar can

217
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:07,720
be a prohibited cultivar as well as a an

218
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:10,449
allowable cultivar and it says this

219
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,300
directly in the recs practices of course

220
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,920
are they don't say it but maybe they

221
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:16,299
would be the same either those you can

222
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:19,240
do or those you can't do but

223
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:21,309
interestingly it works both ways so you

224
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,340
could for example if you're not ready to

225
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:26,079
specify a cultivar or cultivars you

226
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:29,100
could say it won't be these cultivars

227
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,480
and you won't be farming in this manner

228
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,210
so it can be negative as well as

229
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,670
positive in terms of those standards

230
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,139
practices in the light and of course you

231
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:42,370
have to have the record-keeping them to

232
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:44,980
show them so the main thing I think the

233
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,060
main burden names and boundaries are

234
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,580
straightforward

235
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:51,609
the main burden is is going to be the

236
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:54,190
causal link between the geographical

237
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,560
features writ large and the final

238
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,870
cannabis product and all the standards

239
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,289
practices and cultivar prescriptions

240
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,279
that go along with it

241
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:05,069
great thank you Richard I really

242
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,579
appreciate that

243
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:11,370
I think this is a good segue to discuss

244
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,230
terroir it's it's been a topic that the

245
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,039
farming community has been talking about

246
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,450
for reviewers and Heather I know this is

247
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,120
something that you've been working on as

248
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,100
well would you speak to the issue of

249
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,389
terroir and how it relates to the

250
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:30,360
program and the causal link yeah sure

251
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:34,639
and here are is really an important

252
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:38,580
concept it's a French term and it's been

253
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:40,409
translated as the taste of place and and

254
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,300
I think it's a lot more complex than

255
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:45,139
just the taste of place it's this whole

256
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:50,549
concept of you know the environmental

257
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:52,860
factors that affect the product what my

258
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:56,009
friends as Sciences Holly Hall called

259
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:59,789
the biophysical factor so the climate

260
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:01,350
the soil and you know the way the fog

261
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:05,099
rolls in and how that affects the

262
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:07,649
product but additionally also the human

263
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,860
factors so what are the ways that humans

264
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:12,149
have interacted with that you know

265
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,180
terroirs generally through an

266
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:19,110
agricultural lens and so how that the

267
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:22,789
humans have worked with the environment

268
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:29,159
in that agricultural practice or in that

269
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:32,939
agricultural point I trying to say in

270
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:36,449
that area of agriculture and so for

271
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,820
cannabis for instance the way that we

272
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,680
have interacted with the plant has been

273
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,500
under a cloud of prohibition for so long

274
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:47,059
and so you know we have this opportunity

275
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,110
through the statute to codify

276
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:52,709
essentially it's the codification in

277
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,180
regulation anyways the standards that we

278
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,889
have used under this cloud of

279
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,269
prohibition for so long to cultivate the

280
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:00,419
plant in our Northern California and our

281
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:01,949
legacy producing health and that the the

282
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:04,559
practices that we've employed what are

283
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,240
the traditional practices and what are

284
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,569
the cultivars that grow in certain ways

285
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,299
and those human interactions with just a

286
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:15,060
regular cultivation of the plant

287
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:17,279
together that allows in California

288
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,289
cannabis to an active program that is

289
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:25,399
terroir based

290
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:29,838
is linked to the the the product is

291
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:31,489
linked to the plate and so the link

292
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,649
between products in place those are

293
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:35,929
generally governed in law by

294
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:39,038
appellations of origin the appellation

295
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:43,728
of origins well like I said codify those

296
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:46,999
links into the regulation and that's the

297
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:51,559
causal link there that's how come why

298
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:53,989
the product expresses the plate it's

299
00:13:51,558 --> 00:13:55,999
because of the causation there and so

300
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:57,528
it's really exciting in California

301
00:13:55,999 --> 00:14:01,879
cannabis law because we have this

302
00:13:57,528 --> 00:14:07,338
opportunity to do so to link the

303
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:08,928
products to the place using the using

304
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:11,689
these causal links through standards

305
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:15,678
practices varietals our geographical

306
00:14:11,688 --> 00:14:19,068
features and it's a really exciting

307
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:23,028
opportunity that we have and the

308
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:25,969
regulations I think set us up to to be

309
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:28,519
able to do that except for they do

310
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,889
include this reputational evidence as

311
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:33,318
well which Richard talked about earlier

312
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:36,369
that we have two different ways that we

313
00:14:33,318 --> 00:14:39,878
can codify or two different sort of

314
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:46,309
applications of law that we could use to

315
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:48,739
to to codify the causal link and one

316
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:53,538
comes from the Lisbon Agreement and that

317
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:56,329
is an exclusive or essential the product

318
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:58,639
is exclusively or essentially linked to

319
00:14:56,328 --> 00:15:00,678
its geographical source and that's a

320
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,259
much higher standard

321
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:06,379
whereas we could have one where the

322
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:08,899
reputation is linked to the place and

323
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:11,658
that's a lower standard and so I'm kind

324
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:13,548
of excited to see what we can do here

325
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:16,038
through our draft regulations with CDFA

326
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:19,328
to see if we can push towards a more

327
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:22,188
terroir based application that includes

328
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:24,318
the the human and the geographical

329
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:27,099
factors and the reason that that's so

330
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:28,308
important is because terroir base

331
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,470
Appalachians

332
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:31,350
have a higher value in the marketplace

333
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,279
and

334
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:37,590
tomber understand that when something

335
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:42,269
went up programs like an Operations

336
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:45,660
program when that can ensure to the

337
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:47,850
consumer that not only does it come from

338
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:50,039
a particular place but that the

339
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,090
standards that are used or the practices

340
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,899
that are used or the particular

341
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:56,610
cultivars that are used are also set

342
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,350
forth in that theme or controlled under

343
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,690
that same program the consumers can have

344
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,659
a heightened trust and when we trust the

345
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:05,910
product more we're more willing to buy

346
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:07,860
or pay a premium price for that and

347
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:11,909
that's shown in all sorts of consumer

348
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,950
studies so the higher price that we can

349
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:16,500
fetch when we have greater control over

350
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:19,560
the appellation and by using a terroir

351
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,919
based a geographic and human controlled

352
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:25,829
type of program and that money then goes

353
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:28,049
back to the farmer and that farmer then

354
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:33,270
spends the money locally and we have

355
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:35,009
then increased economic ability for our

356
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:37,559
farms and for the communities that have

357
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:40,340
a terroir based appellation program and

358
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:44,489
there's a ton of other reasons why the

359
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:47,070
terroir based Appalachians program you

360
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,919
know when it has a heightened control is

361
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,720
good for our communities and one of the

362
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,939
other reasons in addition to consumer

363
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,820
confidence and therefore higher brand

364
00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:01,620
value higher economic opportunity for

365
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:07,680
the farmer and for the community is also

366
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:10,529
that the codification in regulation of

367
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,830
our practices and what we've been doing

368
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:16,589
in the hill for so long that allows us

369
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:18,629
to protect it in a way that if someone

370
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:21,329
from big AG wants to come in and say

371
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,490
this is hand trimmed or this is you know

372
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:26,519
this cannabis is produced in a certain

373
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:29,910
way but there is at least some reference

374
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,829
to what that means and it's going to be

375
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:35,070
harder for somebody to take that type of

376
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:37,889
practice and to co-opt it into big act

377
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:41,759
the other exciting thing about that is

378
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:44,400
by keeping all this stuff local and we

379
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,390
can work together to have a more

380
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,130
regenerative business

381
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:51,840
model and that can work to reduce the

382
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,340
global supply chain right now that is

383
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,709
causing so many farmers and other

384
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,269
agricultural industries and to just be

385
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,610
squeezed out so many of that contract

386
00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:01,139
farmers you know it's like essentially

387
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:04,619
in some ways a new form of indentured

388
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,420
servitude and so you know the fact that

389
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:08,939
we can keep our value we can tell our

390
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:11,970
story our own way we can manage how our

391
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:15,539
story is told out into in other ways I

392
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:18,000
mean in other industries and so that

393
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:20,480
it's not co-opted it's a really exciting

394
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,839
opportunity and we have that right now

395
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,339
in a way that wine doesn't have wine ABA

396
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:28,439
is that American viticulture

397
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:30,359
associations cannot regulate in a really

398
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,029
strong meaningful way standards

399
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:36,209
practices or cultivars but cannabis says

400
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:38,730
we do have this opportunity so to to

401
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:41,069
lose it and not use it right now when

402
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:45,960
we're set up and teed up in such a great

403
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:52,230
way is would be it I think a

404
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:53,970
disappointment to to the the work that's

405
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,529
been done so far to get us to this point

406
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,789
where we are teed up in that way so I'm

407
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:57,680
really excited by these good for the

408
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:01,889
farmers I think it's good for

409
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:03,990
communities and I'm really hoping and

410
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,220
praying that we do have a terroir based

411
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,279
program that's enacted here in

412
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,170
California well thanks Heather I really

413
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:12,089
appreciate that and I want to key in on

414
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,759
something that you really brought to the

415
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:17,369
fore which is the consumer trust and

416
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:20,460
consumer loyalty because that is

417
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:23,549
effectively how we can leverage this

418
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,470
tool in the market right and bring bring

419
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:28,470
those deliverables back to our producing

420
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,660
communities you know as we've been

421
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,309
researching and meeting and discussing

422
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,230
this and thinking about the program

423
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:37,440
we're going to try and look through the

424
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,269
eye of the consumer and ask ourselves

425
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,370
how we can reach them you know what are

426
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:42,869
the tools that we have and I think one

427
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:45,179
of the most powerful tools

428
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:47,429
that's not spoken to in the regulations

429
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,430
and and I think certainly there's going

430
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,400
to be a lot of comment coming forward is

431
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:56,730
the concept of an official seal an

432
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,298
authenticating seal a logo that lives on

433
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:02,140
the product and really rare

434
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:04,910
this program and so a standardized seal

435
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:07,250
and Omar I know you've done a lot of

436
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,808
research and thinking and looking into

437
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,548
this and so I'd love to hear your

438
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:12,319
thoughts about you know what what you

439
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:14,389
would like to see happen along those

440
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,519
lines yeah thank you

441
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,919
I would like to see an official seal

442
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:21,769
that the state of California adopts and

443
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:23,210
the official seal will be an emblem of

444
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:25,879
authenticity

445
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:28,190
it will provide consumers with helpful

446
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,919
information about the origin of the

447
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:33,320
cannabis and the requirements associated

448
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:36,470
with California cannabis appellations

449
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:39,918
which are requirements for practices

450
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:41,870
standards or cultivars we want it to be

451
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,929
something that's consistent and easy to

452
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:46,808
identify so in the European Union

453
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:50,000
there's something like this and this is

454
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:52,940
denim miniature Nate the original

455
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,980
prototype and this is for like cheese

456
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,150
and other types of products but it's

457
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:00,860
like a nice identifiable seal that

458
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,390
consumers can you know without knowing

459
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,159
anything about the particular product

460
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:08,540
they can see the identifying seal and

461
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:13,130
see that it's you know a designation of

462
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:15,678
origin that is protected and that is you

463
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:19,309
know basically like a proxy for quality

464
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:22,460
for consumers it will assist consumers

465
00:21:19,308 --> 00:21:25,428
in differentiating among products in a

466
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,289
very crowded marketplace and so what we

467
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:30,290
have in mind would be something kind of

468
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:33,349
like the you know here's like the the do

469
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:35,839
C steal and there would be like a

470
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:38,839
uniform design element the ring on the

471
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:41,418
outside would state official California

472
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:44,000
cannabis appellation and then the area

473
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:46,940
on the inside would have the name of the

474
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,369
appellation as well as Union as a unique

475
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,320
design that would give petitioners

476
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:54,589
artistic leeway so it would be like a

477
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:57,529
cool seal whatever the you know proposal

478
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:59,449
the petitioners come up with and the

479
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:02,289
main benefit you know to having an

480
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:06,529
official seal is that individual

481
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:07,819
appellation you know the licensees where

482
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:10,129
are the ones who benefit from the

483
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:12,208
appellations they will be relieved of

484
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:15,119
being solely responsive

485
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:17,849
for enforcement and monitoring costs the

486
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:20,519
state would be incentivized to make sure

487
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:22,648
that the official seals are not misused

488
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,538
and so basically it would give the state

489
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:27,628
of California some skin in the game in

490
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:30,419
protecting appellations the system that

491
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:33,178
has been currently proposed it's not

492
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:34,649
really and partly because it can't but

493
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:37,109
the regulators can't impose criminal

494
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:38,758
penalties on those who are not subject

495
00:22:37,108 --> 00:22:41,519
to their regulations they cannot like

496
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:44,479
forbid you know the use of these seals

497
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:47,999
but I think this would be something that

498
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:50,788
would really like number one help

499
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:53,269
consumers identify official California

500
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:56,699
Academy South Asians and thereby make

501
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:59,909
appellations more valuable and more

502
00:22:56,699 --> 00:23:02,849
recognizable more uniform and so that's

503
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:05,219
something that we had identified and

504
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:06,928
looking at you know the examples of

505
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:10,199
other parts of the world we don't really

506
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:12,449
need to reinvent the wheel because you

507
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:15,538
know people have really you know this is

508
00:23:12,449 --> 00:23:17,099
what works in the marketplace in Europe

509
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:18,690
and I think it's something that would

510
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:21,499
work here in California and that would

511
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:25,709
probably spread out throughout the world

512
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:26,848
yeah I think I really support that and I

513
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:29,159
want to mention you know we've been

514
00:23:26,848 --> 00:23:31,318
talking about applying that concept also

515
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,559
to count origin right so we've got the

516
00:23:31,318 --> 00:23:36,269
two tools for geographic indications for

517
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,709
canvass we've got the county of origin

518
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:40,078
and the appellation of origin and I

519
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:41,489
think in polls cases particularly you

520
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:44,278
know the opportunity for conjunctive

521
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:46,139
labeling where you're identifying that

522
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:49,108
County area and then perhaps an

523
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:52,138
appellation within that County area I

524
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:54,418
think that would be really helpful yeah

525
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:56,608
it's a great one of these could say you

526
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:57,509
know could identify a county yeah and

527
00:23:56,608 --> 00:24:01,499
the other one could be like the

528
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:03,808
appellation yeah and I think you know

529
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:06,509
you spoke a little bit too you know that

530
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:10,308
could be another opportunity to look at

531
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:14,038
funding and fee structures and how we

532
00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:16,078
tackle the cost of the program and the

533
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:18,449
cost of petitioners you know one of the

534
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:20,368
first reactions and strongest reactions

535
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:22,859
we've gotten from farmers taking a look

536
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:23,859
at the regulations is concerned over the

537
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:28,000
proposed

538
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:31,629
so $20,000 biola petition $10,000 to

539
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,059
amend and so you know it's our

540
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:36,820
understanding that part of part of why

541
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:39,279
it's structured that way is the agency

542
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:42,519
really needs the the fees to fund the

543
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,559
program and so we've all been discussing

544
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:47,529
various ideas about how to spread those

545
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:50,139
costs out and lower the barriers to

546
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:52,509
entry for farmers and so I just want to

547
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,130
open it up to the group to discuss this

548
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:56,500
and bring forward some of the ideas that

549
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:59,820
I've been hearing about how to how to

550
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,819
really tackle that issue

551
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:07,969
well like I could take the lead I guess

552
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:12,080
you know the barriers to entry extremely

553
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:16,250
high like $20,000 for a petition to

554
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:18,529
establish and $10,000 for a renewal and

555
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,690
I think this is predicated on the idea

556
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:24,879
that they're gonna get these fees one

557
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:27,640
time up front and this will fund the

558
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,440
appellations program forever

559
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,080
indefinitely in perpetuity which is an

560
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,230
insane way to fund a program because it

561
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:39,079
doesn't really account for enforcement

562
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:41,870
and it doesn't account for maintaining a

563
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:43,970
viable thriving program and so what

564
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:45,859
we're thinking is instead of creating

565
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,410
such a high initial barrier to entry by

566
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:50,689
happening at one time feed to establish

567
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,790
an Appalachian and no other revenue

568
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:55,400
sources why don't we think of new ways

569
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:58,369
to bring in revenue to lower the barrier

570
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,160
barrier to entry so what I've heard from

571
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:03,319
some struggling farmers in the Thom Kai

572
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,240
region of Mendocino County they're

573
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,429
thinking why should we have to pay

574
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,710
anything why should it the state be

575
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,029
paying for all you know for the cannabis

576
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,049
appellation program which is an

577
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:15,829
excellent question

578
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:18,079
why should this be a burden that those

579
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:22,309
who are proposing appellations you know

580
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:23,990
have to bear but if we're gonna assume

581
00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:26,419
for the sake of argument that this must

582
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:28,279
be a revenue neutral endeavor then

583
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,930
there's ways to like lower the barriers

584
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:33,379
to entry significantly and that's by

585
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:35,390
requiring renewal fees every ten years

586
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,070
once an Appalachian is established and

587
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,350
instead of charging twenty thousand

588
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:41,480
dollars upfront forever and never charge

589
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:43,579
ten thousand dollars up front and every

590
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,690
ten years charge another ten thousand

591
00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:49,129
dollars and that will maintain a viable

592
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:52,160
appellations program we're also thinking

593
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:55,610
that use of the proposed sealer seals

594
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:58,519
would be subject to a modest royalty and

595
00:26:55,609 --> 00:27:01,429
that would incentivize official

596
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:03,680
enforcement against misuse because now

597
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:05,990
the state doesn't want anybody stealing

598
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,880
their tax money with these fake seals

599
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,500
and I think there's other other

600
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:14,420
proposals that are lead to my

601
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:15,410
co-panelists sure a couple of points I

602
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,480
agree with with

603
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:22,070
everything you said Omar and Heather

604
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:24,529
just first of all the fee for for filing

605
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:26,059
an ABA is zero okay just so we know by

606
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:30,980
comparison the federal government does

607
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:33,409
not charge a fee for for filing a

608
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:37,220
petition nor does it require as these

609
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:39,019
regs do the users of the appellation to

610
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,180
file a notice abuse

611
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:43,250
well the notice of use of who's using an

612
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,620
appellation is another funding potential

613
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,559
funding mechanism because particularly

614
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:51,409
if the cannabis is is used by not just

615
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:56,929
cultivators but manufactured products or

616
00:27:51,410 --> 00:28:00,170
other manufacturers there were others

617
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:01,539
they would contribute to the funding and

618
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:05,000
the enforcement of the program as well

619
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:06,710
the the part of it $20,000 a lot of

620
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,089
money because you have to pay experts as

621
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:12,559
well I think they calculated in the

622
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:14,559
financial section which wasn't

623
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,329
distributed online but is available

624
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:22,279
cost-benefit analysis that high between

625
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:25,099
hiring experts and paying this fee that

626
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:27,740
you know you're gonna be close to 70 80

627
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:29,449
hundred thousand dollars but by the time

628
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,730
you get done with an appellation of

629
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,190
origin that's a lot of money um and I

630
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:37,460
find it particularly troublesome that

631
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,980
there's a fee of ten thousand thousand

632
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:42,740
whatever and change to make an amendment

633
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,480
because in fact amendments will probably

634
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,789
be routine and I'm not thinking of

635
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,380
amendments of the boundary or the name

636
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:50,899
I'm thinking of the amendments of the

637
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,300
standards practices and cultivars once

638
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,730
the group the petitioning group and all

639
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:57,379
the people inside the area start working

640
00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:00,110
with one another and they come up with

641
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:02,360
new ideas and they gain consensus on new

642
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:04,729
practices and new standards there should

643
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:06,859
be numerous amendments and there those

644
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:12,829
should not be prohibited those would be

645
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:14,959
free or very minimal cost yeah thank you

646
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:17,210
Richard I I think you know such a

647
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,549
salient point because the amendment

648
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:20,870
process is going to allow innovation to

649
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,759
move forward and you spoke to that

650
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:25,849
tension between innovation and tradition

651
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:27,109
and I think you know also it helps

652
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:28,089
inform the development of the program

653
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:29,709
you

654
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:32,558
through that amendment process that

655
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:34,450
we're going to learn and grow and really

656
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,399
develop on a community side on the

657
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:39,370
Appalachian side and on the in the

658
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:45,548
program itself hi Blake I see you've

659
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:47,229
joined us yes I reappeared I wanted to

660
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:50,048
jump in because we've received some very

661
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:53,380
excellent OnPoint questions but I wanted

662
00:29:50,048 --> 00:29:56,470
to subject you guys to and on the note

663
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,450
that we were just talking about the

664
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:01,870
first question I wanted to ask that

665
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,850
comes from Matthew Allen who's asking if

666
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:06,009
wine took hundreds of years to create

667
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:08,048
Appalachians is there a risk that

668
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:11,288
creating Appalachians for cannabis that

669
00:30:08,048 --> 00:30:14,139
it's too early and in the legal process

670
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:16,690
you know the process of cannabis coming

671
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,460
to legalization I mean are we we

672
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,110
building this like grand edifice it's

673
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:23,710
not gonna actually do anything

674
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:25,990
I mean is it actually going to amending

675
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:29,548
these things is that going to help what

676
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:33,339
do you see in terms of the efficacy here

677
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:35,619
well if I may I'll just start this I

678
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:37,658
don't think it's too early I think

679
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:39,339
anytime you have a product that's

680
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:41,049
already well known you'd better be your

681
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:43,119
Appalachian program sooner rather than

682
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:44,980
later or you'll have so many knockoffs

683
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,408
out there that your Appalachians will

684
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,690
never be meaningful by the same token

685
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:52,960
Blake well I think the Appalachian

686
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:57,340
should start now I think you know having

687
00:30:52,960 --> 00:31:02,079
any three petitioners decide on an

688
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:04,449
Appalachian may be too few and lead to a

689
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,908
rush to market you know I want mine and

690
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,019
not another three people want theirs

691
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:11,799
particularly if they allow partially

692
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:14,619
overlapping Appalachians thank you Chris

693
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:16,329
for those of you who are trying to

694
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:20,349
receive CLE credit there is the code

695
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:23,259
sorry continue Richard no the last point

696
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:26,740
is I think having a requiring more

697
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:29,470
consensus before people come in to file

698
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:32,470
would be good I mean there should be a

699
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:34,659
whole consensus building process notes

700
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,669
the people inside in Appalachian before

701
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:38,860
they file rather than everybody wanting

702
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:41,500
to get their names quickly so I think

703
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:41,889
CDFA estimated there would be ten new

704
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Apple

705
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:46,630
a year I think that was in their

706
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,279
cost-benefit analysis I mean you know

707
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,260
let's take the time let's do them well

708
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:52,058
the first ones are really important to

709
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:55,210
establish some precedent here about the

710
00:31:52,058 --> 00:32:01,210
causal link and let's go slow but let's

711
00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:02,620
start now whereas my just adds about I

712
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,360
really agree with what Richards saying

713
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:06,369
and one of the things that we're hoping

714
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:10,449
is to see federal and international

715
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:12,250
walls fall and so if we do hold up not

716
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,440
only will there be so many knockoffs and

717
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,910
copycats biking's Northern California

718
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,500
and our legacy cannabis producing

719
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:21,220
regions will lose a significant

720
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:23,230
opportunity to define what the program

721
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:26,558
could look like that could then be

722
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:29,558
emulated around the globe as these walls

723
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:32,889
do hopefully fall and I think that

724
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:36,039
they're expected to do so in the coming

725
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:39,009
year and that actually leads to another

726
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:41,740
good question that we received from one

727
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:43,390
of our viewers from Massachusetts it's

728
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:46,450
bit of a longer question but the the

729
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:49,450
gist of it is how do you see the

730
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:52,750
California Appalachian program meshing

731
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:56,048
with with other states and potentially a

732
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:57,849
federal program is this sort of like you

733
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:59,829
know a test case is a little incubator

734
00:32:57,849 --> 00:33:02,980
where we test out the system and then

735
00:32:59,829 --> 00:33:06,879
maybe you know put it forth the out of

736
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:09,759
the federal level are we looking to see

737
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,970
how other states use it as well or how

738
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:15,099
do you see this program maybe as an

739
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:18,400
exemplar for others or something to that

740
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:20,889
effect sure I would say of course

741
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,330
California so goes the nation and you

742
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:25,840
know this is one of the biggest

743
00:33:22,329 --> 00:33:27,808
laboratories of democracy so what the

744
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,069
experiments in California tend to

745
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,160
propagate across the whole United States

746
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:34,689
and you know if somebody said in

747
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,400
Massachusetts it's already thinking like

748
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:40,529
how are they doing Appalachians in

749
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:43,929
California I think that portends well

750
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:46,269
yeah I would agree I you know we have

751
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:48,429
been our organization has been so laser

752
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:52,089
focused on the policy because we are

753
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:53,559
setting a precedent here and we do have

754
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:54,668
other states watching this very closely

755
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:56,710
I know

756
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:58,989
at Oregon Washington are looking at this

757
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:01,269
Jamaica is looking at this you know

758
00:33:58,989 --> 00:34:03,899
there are legacy cannabis producing

759
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:07,149
regions all over the world that are in

760
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:09,029
in a very kind of you know pressing it

761
00:34:07,148 --> 00:34:11,710
moment right now in terms of

762
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:13,200
legalization unfolding internationally

763
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,878
and and this is such a tremendous

764
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,638
mechanism to protect you know

765
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:22,539
traditional producing communities and

766
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,039
their genetic property their

767
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:26,469
intellectual property their traditional

768
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:28,808
knowledge and so you know I absolutely

769
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:31,808
think that you know this is a very

770
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:34,210
pivotal moment and getting this policy

771
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:36,579
right means sort of everything for those

772
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:40,990
communities worldwide just because of

773
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:42,909
the precedent sure and I think we should

774
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:44,858
cut off in a moment but I do have one

775
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,878
more question that has come up a bit and

776
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:50,710
some of the questions that have arisen

777
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:53,618
here in the petition process they gets 9

778
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:56,378
102 the petitioner is supposed to

779
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:59,349
specify the license types for the

780
00:34:56,378 --> 00:35:02,558
cultivation license types that the

781
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:05,079
appellation would apply to and that

782
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,720
particular section allows for all types

783
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:11,440
so you could you could list mixed indoor

784
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:14,169
outdoor cultivation as part of the

785
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,679
appellation however it's unclear how

786
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:19,960
some of the other requirements would

787
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:22,058
allow for indoor cultivators to be a

788
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,829
part of an appellation I was wondering

789
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:26,829
if any of you had thought about that or

790
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:30,039
how you think that indoor cultivators or

791
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:31,798
people who are using bagged soils how

792
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:36,250
that would play into this new system

793
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:38,079
well or no soil at all you know my view

794
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,519
about that you're right and thank you

795
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,890
for pointing it out whoever asked that

796
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,989
question I should have made that clear

797
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:47,858
at the outset you're part of a petition

798
00:35:43,989 --> 00:35:50,259
is to say which license types are

799
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:52,449
allowed to use the appellation

800
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:55,450
personally if we're talking about a

801
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:58,088
terroir based population system it would

802
00:35:55,449 --> 00:36:00,429
be in a causal link between a natural

803
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:03,578
environment the natural environment not

804
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:05,219
an indoor created environment it would

805
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:07,539
be a mockery to have an indoor

806
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:08,119
appellation I guess one could claim the

807
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:10,670
rep

808
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,650
station has been developed in a certain

809
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:15,800
region but if we're talking about

810
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:18,559
terroir then then it's not possible and

811
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,900
the fewer interferences between the

812
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:23,210
natural environment or manipulations or

813
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:26,869
whatever you want to call them and the

814
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:29,809
final product is a more true and

815
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:33,529
integral and comprehensive and

816
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:37,820
understandable system that's what we're

817
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:38,510
working for right now absolutely all

818
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,120
right

819
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:44,180
and I guess since Chris isn't stopping

820
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:48,529
me I think I get to to pick another

821
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:50,239
question here so one of the other

822
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:54,710
questions I thought was interesting this

823
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:57,609
comes from Amy King does the terroir

824
00:36:54,710 --> 00:37:01,220
based system set too high of a standard

825
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:03,650
for for people who want to establish an

826
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,659
appellation or sort of take advantage of

827
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:08,300
the protections and the opportunities

828
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:10,099
that come with an appellation so is it

829
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,870
is it too prohibitive does does it

830
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:13,519
create too much tension going back to

831
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:16,519
Richard's presentation too much tension

832
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:20,090
between the standards and traditions of

833
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:21,650
old and then innovation I want to is

834
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,809
just make you quick comments on that and

835
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:26,570
I'll pass it off to somebody else to say

836
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:29,690
it more eloquently than I can but one I

837
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:32,210
think that it's not too strict consumers

838
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:34,610
respond to those strict control controls

839
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:37,220
and will pay a higher price for them so

840
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:39,019
I think the stricter that controls the

841
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:41,239
better and I often think that the

842
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:44,119
terroir base program is going to be more

843
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:45,919
defensible if challenged so if you can't

844
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:47,480
prove your causal link because you don't

845
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,280
have one because you're not terroir

846
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,889
based then how are you going to defend

847
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:58,190
it a punch challenge that was very

848
00:37:51,889 --> 00:38:00,349
elegantly stated agreed there now if

849
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:02,119
it's too elegant I can't go ahead if you

850
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:03,619
want to think one final note Janine and

851
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:05,630
then we need to we need to shift off

852
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:08,000
well I just wanted to point out again

853
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:10,039
that we've got to two tools we've got

854
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,989
county of origin which is all inclusive

855
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:14,300
there's no additional standards on it

856
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:15,859
it's open to all operators and then

857
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,789
we've got appellation of origin and

858
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,730
there's a balance there between

859
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:21,800
inclusivity and exclusivity and I think

860
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,909
that's often kind of set to the side

861
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,860
and not really a part of the

862
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:27,730
conversation so I think that's really an

863
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:30,289
important piece to address that concern

864
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:32,659
excellent all right

865
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:34,250
thank you all it was pleasure hearing

866
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:35,750
all of you talk about this the new

867
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:38,059
system because it's just it's so

868
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,400
interesting it's it's got elements of

869
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:42,889
the the AOC where we've got standards

870
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,690
practice and cultivars but then also

871
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:55,099
leaving a little bit of room because it

872
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:58,010
is so new for the innovation our keynote

873
00:38:55,099 --> 00:39:00,619
panel which focuses on the proposed

874
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:03,020

you to introduce yourself and tell us

tell us a little bit about yourself sure

909
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:30,379
my name is Omar Figueroa I am currently

910
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:32,630
in Sevastopol in Sonoma County I've been

911
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,670
a lawyer doing cannabis law for 21 years

912
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,550
when I started out the only type of

913
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,730
cannabis law

914
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:40,800
available with freedom defense

915
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:43,530
liberating cultivators to have been

916
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,320
charged with felony cultivation back

917
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:48,210
before 2016 the cultivation of a single

918
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,070
plant for any purpose was deemed a

919
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:54,090
felony and it was a pretty serious

920
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:56,700
offense and so like with you know other

921
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:58,680
lawyers like with Heather we did a lot

922
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:02,000
of Academy's defense over the years and

923
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:04,019
then and I developed a passion for

924
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,090
representing cannabis growers because

925
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:10,920
they were like the nicest of all the

926
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,720
defendants they were responsible they

927
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,730
were peaceful they did all their

928
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,730
homework they did community service you

929
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:19,079
know they were like just really you know

930
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:21,719
the kind of people that I looked up to

931
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:24,029
and so I'm you know in my pursuit of the

932
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:26,399
world's finest cannabis because I had no

933
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:30,180
skills as a grower I focused on the

934
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,039
pending growers because they had you

935
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:35,250
know certainly like the highest quality

936
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:37,739
and you know that it was like there's

937
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:40,050
like a saying back in the day you know

938
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:43,529
solve the rest and smoke the best or

939
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:45,539
whatever and usually the lawyers we get

940
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:48,210
something called a head stash which was

941
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:49,949
like the very finest part of the

942
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:52,679
cannabis so I guess if I were a wine

943
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:56,489
aficionado you know I would have said

944
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:58,440
that I pursued you know my journey you

945
00:41:56,489 --> 00:42:00,479
know for cannabis is I was like seeking

946
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,730
the world's best cannabis and since I

947
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,000
didn't have the skills to produce it I

948
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:09,329
focused on representing those who did so

949
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,610
I wasn't a cannabis community myself as

950
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:13,409
a young person and saw my friends

951
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,700
getting arrested and wanted to do

952
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:17,819
something about it so we went to law

953
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:19,529
school and became a lawyer and I'm

954
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:23,700
really lucky that I was good at it and I

955
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:24,870
enjoyed it and and at some point you

956
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:26,879
know write out a lot so actually went to

957
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:28,230
work for Omar he was my first mentor out

958
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,690
of law school and I worked for him for

959
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:32,519
about two years which was awesome

960
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:36,349
because we got to learn really fun

961
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:39,179
exciting and all sorts of crazy emotions

962
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:40,799
and we got to work I got to working

963
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:42,239
primarily for cannabis farmers and for

964
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,140
people who are like my friends at family

965
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:49,389
and it was really exciting intro to the

966
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:54,849
law to practice Omar style like most

967
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:57,250
have a really fun new novel ideas that

968
00:42:54,849 --> 00:43:00,069
we litigated in one all the time because

969
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:02,829
this you know cannabis law and where

970
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:05,769
we're at right now it has been such like

971
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:08,949
it's a watershed moment and so a lot of

972
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:11,440
these laws were right for winning and it

973
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:14,829
was really exciting time as a new lawyer

974
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,510
now going to oh you're ten years and the

975
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:18,549
entire time has been practice been

976
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,290
supporting cannabis farmers so people

977
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:22,240
say like what kind of lawyer are you am

978
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:23,409
I or what are gamba farmers in need of

979
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,109
right now that's the kind of law I

980
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:28,750
practice and so a lot of times when we

981
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:31,539
see these big shifts in the laughs I'll

982
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:34,389
just get really deep into those areas of

983
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:35,860
law and the policies and learn that area

984
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:39,699
of law and I've done that now probably

985
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:41,410
do every time and I'm really excited for

986
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:43,839
the Appalachian program because in my

987
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:46,509
mind you know the Appalachian program if

988
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,070
we can get it right this could be the

989
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:50,260
program that we have been working for

990
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:53,650
for so long I mean just had the

991
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:55,780
opportunity the potential here to really

992
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:57,820
like support candid farmers and not just

993
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,280
any cannabis farmers but like our legacy

994
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,980
heritage producing canvas farmers and

995
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,550
our legacy producing regions and that's

996
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:09,030
me is so excited exciting so I've kind

997
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:12,430
of shifted my practice towards

998
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:14,080
Appalachians in a big way and right now

999
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:15,789
it's mostly you know pro bono work

1000
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,130
policy work and really just what I like

1001
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:20,920
to do on my free time because it's so

1002
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:22,809
important but in any event I represent

1003
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,200
canvass farmers I live in Nevada City

1004
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:27,340
I've been here for five or six years and

1005
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:28,899
Sonoma County before that I went to

1006
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,670
Humboldt State and just in a couple

1007
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,680
months my son is going to college and

1008
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:36,130
humble and I will be moving back there

1009
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:38,079
so I'm really excited to be where I

1010
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:40,210
think we were going to have the greatest

1011
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,860
concentration of cannabis farmers doing

1012
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:46,690
appellations work and to see how that

1013
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:49,539
you know unfolds over the next few years

1014
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:52,210
to me and to be an observer and a

1015
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:53,590
supporter and that is just the highest

1016
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:55,000
honor that I think that I'll probably

1017
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,800
ever get in my career I'm really

1018
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,059
