[Music]

2
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,538
attracting is not the issue I feel like

3
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,278
there's lots of people right now who

4
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,769
want to get into the cannabis industry

5
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,300
on the ground floor it's like a big buzz

6
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,659
there's lots of people who want to get

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,370
in sifting through all of those resumes

8
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,679
this is something that's a little bit

9
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:40,308
trickier and he touched a little bit on

10
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,558
that that we have this really lengthy

11
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:44,909
hiring process to make sure that the

12
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,399
person that we're bringing onto the team

13
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:50,069
is is really a good fit because we do

14
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,920
struggle with a lot of turnover and it's

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,808
very difficult to to bring someone on

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,489
have them fill out all that HR paperwork

17
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:58,378
train them in all these different things

18
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:01,948
just to have them walk away you know a

19
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,269
couple weeks later so that's I feel like

20
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:05,849
more of a struggle is sifting through

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,829
and finding the right addition to the

22
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:10,259
team what I'm looking for when I'm

23
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,030
sifting through resumes is more people

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,890
who are bringing experiences from other

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,400
industries than necessarily people who

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,019
are bringing cannabis experience most

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,400
people who have cannabis experience have

28
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,379
experienced it in the legal industry

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,900
where they're expecting things like cash

30
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,759
at the end of the day or not having to

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,090
show up to work on time or being able to

32
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,978
be overtly medicated while at work that

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,840
is a huge misconception of is that oh

34
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,658
you guys are just all back there smoking

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,020
all day like no this job is hard you're

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,090
gonna be working a lot so finding people

37
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,009
who are interested in cannabis the way

38
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,219
we do it and not cannabis the way that

39
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,469
it was done five ten years ago is is a

40
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,920
little bit trickier so I'm looking for

41
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:55,548
people with either retail experience

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:59,310
inventory experience medical experience

43
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:00,899
these are oh absolutely if you have

44
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,750
experience in local government like yes

45
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,399
I'll definitely hire you but these are

46
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,759
all things what we found is that you can

47
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,459
take these skills and and adjust them to

48
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,189
cannabis instead of trying to bring

49
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,979
somebody

50
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:16,329
and and teach them customer service you

51
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:18,669
know if I can take someone who came from

52
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:22,510
a retail background they understand how

53
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:24,099
to talk with people how to to study a

54
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,469
product line and do all these other

55
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,359
things so that's a lot easier for me to

56
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:30,789
train than necessarily someone who's

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,350
just a cannabis enthusiast because you

58
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:34,030
can meet lots of cannabis enthusiasts

59
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,919
that are very intelligent but there's

60
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,259
also the flip side of it that that's all

61
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,429
they're interested in so I think it's

62
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:41,439
important to make sure that you're

63
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,450
finding people with diverse interests

64
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,699
that can that can do a lot of things

65
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:48,579
from the store and for me the the thing

66
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:51,369
that I a lot of times higher for it's

67
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:56,290
something that I I cannot train I cannot

68
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:57,819
mentor it there's is integrity so and

69
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:59,769
that's the same way that I do purchasing

70
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:02,469
so if I have a company that I don't

71
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:05,290
align with their business philosophy I

72
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:07,509
no longer carry their product because I

73
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:09,729
cannot I feel like as an activist and a

74
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:11,590
leader in this industry is I want to

75
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:13,569
support the best and that means that

76
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,879
when I'm hiring people or buying product

77
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:18,400
I want the best and then that puts us

78
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:22,750
into the situation of okay now you have

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,520
them how do you keep them and this is an

80
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,849
industry which is never give paid

81
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:32,890
vacations or even proper pay legal pay

82
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:35,049
and you know Cassie and I regularly have

83
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:37,059
meetings on do we need to where can we

84
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,520
give raises you know who needs a raise

85
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,509
who's due for those who needs a vacation

86
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,730
and we want to make sure that that's

87
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:44,979
taken care of because if I don't offer

88
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:46,869
it there's another end another company

89
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:48,759
that's coming forward that does offer it

90
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,950
and then that's I mean that's which is a

91
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:52,299
really good thing it drives us to step

92
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:54,879
up our game on how we're going to take

93
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,410
care of staff before we hired solely

94
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,090
from the fact that there were people

95
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:59,650
that didn't want to work in in any other

96
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,420
industry they only wanted to work in

97
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,450
cannabis and only ever had work in

98
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:05,919
cannabis so their standards were not at

99
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:08,319
the same level as a lot of other

100
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,000
industries and now as we're pulling

101
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,909
people from other industries over here

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,219
as I was the one that hired Cassie and

103
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:16,930
when I worked with another store but

104
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:19,600
typically in the past when we were under

105
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,629
they only the medical umbrella is I

106
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,210
would love to find people that have

107
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:27,850
worked in healing and other areas

108
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:29,379
specifically natural healing even

109
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,670
pharmacy technicians I mean their

110
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:33,430
understanding a lot of the medications

111
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,199
that some of our patients were on so

112
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,439
having a healing background was actually

113
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,779
something that really attracted me to

114
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:41,920
actually bringing Cassie on was because

115
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:44,529
she had such a diverse background

116
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,110
specifically in natural healing and

117
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:49,419
that's what I feel like cannabis is and

118
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,970
I oftentimes if somebody is like my

119
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,920
sales manager is was the sales manager

120
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,860
for Nordstrom like this brings their

121
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,390
best practices over to us and you know

122
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,400
it was somebody that they were ready to

123
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,319
get into the cannabis industry now our

124
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,359
goal is to keep them on which would be

125
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,250
really difficult when you're losing your

126
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,170
management team and we're having such a

127
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,600
deficit in this industry of finding and

128
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:12,460
keeping good but genders because they

129
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,590
move up quickly as long as they're good

130
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,239
at their job and they reap the benefits

131
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:18,639
of the training that they're receiving

132
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,129
on their job and a year they're a

133
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,709
perfect candidate for a pretty good

134
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:25,300
sales rep position for a company which

135
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:27,399
is gonna offer more flexibility in their

136
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,199
schedules so this is where you know

137
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:30,579
Cassie and I have to understand that we

138
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,229
need to meet some of these needs so that

139
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:35,019
we can keep you know qualified

140
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:37,090
candidates on the good bud tenders are

141
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,620
definitely being poached by brands but

142
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:40,509
they're also being poached by management

143
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,610
positions you know because good

144
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:45,129
management is also in deficit in the

145
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,900
industry so you know if you've got good

146
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:48,579
skills and a good work ethic a lot of

147
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:52,569
times you're moving up the ranks very

148
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:54,279
quickly which then we lose our best

149
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:56,379
people on the front lines you know

150
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,819
because your bud tenders are the face of

151
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:59,290
your business there are the people who

152
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:02,019
are out there talking to patrons every

153
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:04,480
day and we have some people that that is

154
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:06,819
there that is the goal that we have both

155
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,470
decided upon when we hired them that we

156
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:10,209
knew that they would be moving into a

157
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,880
different track that they would be

158
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:15,759
coming on and soon would become a team

159
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,319
leader and then a team leader is before

160
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,579
you get to assistant manager and then

161
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,990
assistant manager before you get to that

162
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,639
and there's some times we hire people

163
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,170
that just plug right into one of those

164
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,939
roles they don't go from that section

165
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,009
but we want to have upward mobility for

166
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:29,350
all of our positions and all of our

167
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:31,408
staff member to understand that one of

168
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,300
the worst things for any business

169
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:35,338
is where people feel stuck in that job

170
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,369
and they can't move up and so we do

171
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:39,868
oftentimes hire and promote from within

172
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:42,539
and there's times that we need to bring

173
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:45,330
in something to add to our best

174
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:48,808
practices and I think this goes back to

175
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:51,598
the retention question is how to retain

176
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:53,129
people yes good pay and good benefits to

177
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:56,278
stay competitive with other industries

178
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:59,789
is essential but just having people feel

179
00:06:56,278 --> 00:07:02,249
good within their job things like seeing

180
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:04,318
internal promotion like if I work hard I

181
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:06,149
can get to this these goals are fabulous

182
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,249
and I had mentioned this a little bit

183
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:10,139
before of just organizational structure

184
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:11,879
people understanding how the business

185
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,800
works this is your role in your job

186
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,789
description this is who you report to

187
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,739
and this is who they report to I think

188
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:23,068
that that really gives people a lot of

189
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:24,628
confidence in in the business that they

190
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:26,218
okay they know what they're doing

191
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:27,689
instead of sometimes like oh well

192
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:30,360
somebody's got to do it so I guess it's

193
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:32,879
me which kind of happens a lot I think

194
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,739
in cannabis and then people get cranky

195
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,869
like oh well we're making the same wage

196
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:39,088
but I'm working so much harder where

197
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:40,819
when you when you say okay you are

198
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:43,038
working harder you're a team leader

199
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:44,729
people feel a little bit more of that

200
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,168
they feel as though they're being

201
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:47,579
recognized for what they're doing and I

202
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:49,408
think that that helps retain employees

203
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:51,778
when you can say I see what you're doing

204
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:53,129
I want to reward you for that and keep

205
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:56,368
you happy in this position and that's

206
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:58,740
why I am merit based not seniority based

207
00:07:56,369 --> 00:08:00,659
so if you've worked here for a year and

208
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,189
you're not showing me that you're

209
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:07,110
growing and you're not showing me that

210
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:08,129
you deserve more and many issues then

211
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,778
that's probably not going to happen

212
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:11,158
however if I have somebody who comes on

213
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:14,999
and they're just killing it every step

214
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:16,319
of the way if I don't support that and

215
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:18,450
let them know that

216
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,719
doing a wonderful job here they're gonna

217
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,519
start pulling back I'm big on positive

218
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,530
reinforcement for my staff so it's like

219
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,359
you're doing well Cass and I both are

220
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:29,699
very much so we praise our teams and

221
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,650
praise our staff members when we hit

222
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,269
goals when when we have some eye that

223
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:34,949
just goes above and beyond like we

224
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:38,009
utilize something that I brought from

225
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:40,410
another business over to our industry I

226
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:42,720
mean to cannabis here at the store Joe

227
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,449
is slack which is a in-house

228
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,720
communication like email instant

229
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,040
messenger all-in-one where it has helped

230
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,180
us with a lot of communication issues

231
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,500
because in the past when I worked for

232
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:54,870
another dispensary we only did things

233
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,700
for email and text message and it was

234
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,279
just things fell through the cracks all

235
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,440
the time I personally only checked my

236
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,230
email on days that I'm working I don't

237
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,200
check my email on on dates that I'm off

238
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,659
because I need that I need that break

239
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,759
there if there's an emergency we can

240
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:13,799
contact through slack or you can you

241
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,319
know it helped us tremendously and using

242
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,449
software systems has allowed for us to

243
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,430
increase our efficiency in our store and

244
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,920
create better dialogue and communication

245
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:25,109
between each other which I think helps

246
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:27,629
with staff morale because staff morale

247
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,220
can just be very detrimental to your

248
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:30,990
staff if you're not taking care of them

249
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,090
if you don't have you know a good

250
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,230
discount program in place where that

251
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,920
they can afford to buy their own

252
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,240
medicine then it creates issues and then

253
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,620
you're having issues of theft and you

254
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,909
have issues of shrinkage and now we're

255
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:46,039
moving into metric where I can have a

256
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:48,839
2.5 percent variance on my inventory

257
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:51,240
that's gonna be a big issue for us and

258
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,860
making sure that our staff is is you

259
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,710
know doing their best to not have sticky

260
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,570
fingers and oftentimes when employees of

261
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,660
any business when I came from retail

262
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,370
world and in veterinary if you take care

263
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:05,009
of your staff and you respect them then

264
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,690
their integrity level actually goes up

265
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:08,549
there because they don't feel like well

266
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,470
I'm being shorted over here so I'm gonna

267
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:11,579
short them over here and that's

268
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,629
something that we're all gonna have to

269
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,879
understand moving forward especially

270
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:16,759
when we're going to be

271
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:19,370
such strict compliance is how our how

272
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,549
our employees handling inventory are

273
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,080
they actually reporting it properly and

274
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:25,759
which will be quite interesting to get

275
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,800
in this next six months because this is

276
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,840
where a lot of I think the fruits of our

277
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:31,609
labor will actually come through is

278
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,560
because a you know casting I feel like

279
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,919
we've always been ahead of the pack and

280
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:39,079
leading in this industry and every time

281
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:42,229
we've hit milestones we're like July 1st

282
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:44,240
like we've not stressed as bad as I seen

283
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,550
my brothers and sisters in this industry

284
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,840
I absolutely agree with what you're

285
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:49,759
saying about communication being really

286
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,100
important for retention in morale I have

287
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,470
been in a situation where you have a

288
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,210
budtender who's told completely

289
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,310
conflicting information by two managers

290
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,690
right so when you've got somebody here

291
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:00,649
they're trying to do a good job but

292
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,420
they're hearing this thing from one

293
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:03,829
person this thing for another person and

294
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:06,860
they got a patient yelling at them right

295
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:09,680
now like that is a very stressful place

296
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,810
to be in so by us communicating better

297
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,459
and again back to this organizational

298
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:14,989
structure you have people who just feel

299
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,530
more confident in what they're doing

300
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,970
they know yes I can go back and get this

301
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:23,419
inventory because I understand the

302
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,460
protocols where when that communication

303
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:28,459
isn't there there's a lot of times where

304
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,870
mistakes happen and people are yelled at

305
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,570
for those mistakes even though they were

306
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,610
never really told what they were

307
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,500
supposed to do in the first place and I

308
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,080
think one of the biggest misconceptions

309
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,269
I think about cannabis staffing is that

310
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,830
being a budtender which we call them

311
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:45,409
customer assistance so I'm just going to

312
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:48,560
switch to that is an unskilled position

313
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:50,779
because it's really not we're asking

314
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:54,219
people to understand an entire product

315
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:57,350
line to understand complex regulations

316
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,670
and body systems and with the addition

317
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,009
of that final one these things are

318
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:03,110
changing on a day to day basis and

319
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:06,259
they're dealing with angry clientele who

320
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,539
doesn't understand why those changes are

321
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,889
yes we're obsessed with the regulations

322
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:11,599
and reading through them every day but

323
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:12,949
for the most part as patrons are coming

324
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,540
in they're like what do you mean I need

325
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,960
a bag what do you mean I don't need a

326
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:19,579
bag anymore this is really difficult I

327
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,370
think for for bud tenders to deal with

328
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:25,040
and so they have to be trained to deal

329
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,179
with how they're going to study that how

330
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,750
are they going to come in to work on a

331
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,698
Monday

332
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,948
and explain all this stuff and then

333
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:33,049
Tuesday they have to explain a bunch of

334
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:36,469
different things that's not for the week

335
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:38,508
I don't think so I well and we used to

336
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,819
have monthly staff meetings and we did

337
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:43,399
our best to make those happen however

338
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:45,679
now when a business is oh you know we're

339
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,379
here from 7:00 in the morning until 10

340
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:51,500
11 sometimes at night having staff

341
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:53,509
meetings it can't exist and so something

342
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,039
that your team implemented which I think

343
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:57,318
was brilliant is they have shift

344
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,929
meetings so it's coming on a DS shift

345
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,639
and it's something that y'all alright a

346
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:03,138
document together that's shared between

347
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,329
everybody all the management team to

348
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:08,600
wear the same message is being delivered

349
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:10,549
at every single like shift change so

350
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,040
that everybody is up-to-date with this

351
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:14,568
changing policy and i which i think is

352
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,338
brilliant and that's what we need to be

353
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:18,318
doing because in the past when we've

354
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:19,550
taken it away from one cook in the

355
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:21,289
kitchen and we've started to give

356
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,088
responsibilities out and that's when

357
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:24,679
employees start to feel like well who do

358
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:25,970
I go to on this I'm getting one person

359
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:29,269
telling you this one and that's where we

360
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:33,079
have to create to continue to vote to

361
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:34,339
define those roles where the staff

362
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,599
doesn't feel like there's too many cooks

363
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:36,889
in the kitchen like oh I go to the sales

364
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,259
manager for this or the inventory

365
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:41,149
manager or the processing manager and

366
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,769
it's you know we need to make those

367
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:44,720
roles more defined and that's what we

368
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:47,209
continue to do is just when we were met

369
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,800
with these issues we write better SOPs

370
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:56,109
mm-hmm if you take what you view as sort

371
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:59,028
of the baseline average dispensary and

372
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,339
what they do with employees can you give

373
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:03,730
me like three examples of something that

374
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:03,730
you think

375
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:11,278
I make our training programs are pretty

376
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,230
innovative I think that I've heard a lot

377
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,179
of times from employers like oh well I

378
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,950
was a cashier they trained me for like

379
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:18,359
two hours or like I know everything

380
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,980
there is to know about cannabis like I

381
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,839
don't even know everything there is to

382
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,550
know about cannabis you know so I think

383
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,459
that that is definitely something that

384
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:28,708
sets us apart is that we make sure that

385
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:32,489
the people that are coming in that are

386
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:34,319
using our POS system that are taking out

387
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,389
and restocking our inventory we make

388
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,890
sure that they absolutely know what

389
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:39,899
they're doing it might seem like

390
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:41,189
overkill it's like hey you're gonna bud

391
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:43,528
tend for me uh-huh

392
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,060
but that's really the best way to do it

393
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:46,559
and to make sure that that transaction

394
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:49,309
is rung up correctly to make sure that

395
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:52,229
they understand the inventory protocols

396
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:53,819
inventory how easy is counting rain I

397
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,820
have a four year old she's great at it

398
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,709
but how complicated our inventory

399
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,430
protocols making sure that not only

400
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:05,009
floor stock back stock holds defective

401
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:06,599
products um things like all these

402
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:09,689
different things have to be found in

403
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,278
inventory so it's not simply as easy as

404
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,260
going out on the floor picking up a

405
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,179
bucket and counting it you also to make

406
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:17,039
sure none of those packages are damaged

407
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:18,539
that they're all in fact the same name

408
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,778
so these are all things that people

409
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:24,599
think Oh inventories so simple but it

410
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:26,370
actually requires a little bit more over

411
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,190
walk through the process so I think

412
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,769
that's one thing that I feel like we

413
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,050
almost get made fun of by our employees

414
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:36,659
for extensive training program but I

415
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:38,338
also feel a lot more confident that the

416
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:40,439
information that we're giving to patrons

417
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,880
is standardized because I know that

418
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,250
they've all been through this with me

419
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:46,820
and they know what is good and not good

420
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,500
to do and save and there's a lot of

421
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,360
myths in our industry that are sold as

422
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,339
facts and so you know what I'm really

423
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,389
excited on is this next phase of lab

424
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,459
testing when we're going to get into

425
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:57,899
terpene testing that I have a good

426
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,789
friend who manages stores in New Jersey

427
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:02,458
and there are only time they're allowed

428
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:05,458
to say sativa and indica is when they

429
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:06,809
say that it's not true and that's where

430
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,399
I'm really looking forward to us when we

431
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:09,049
have somebody come

432
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,610
like I need something that's good for

433
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:11,990
sleep you know it's like we can go to a

434
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,409
strain that's high and lean a lowland

435
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:17,620
mersin versus let's just say like OG

436
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:20,480
Kush which is oftentimes one of the top

437
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,250
terpenes and OG Kush is pining which is

438
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,379
a stimulant that's why

439
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,029
oh geez hit you hard and so I'm really

440
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:28,519
looking forward to this and that's where

441
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:29,809
to hit on kasi space is that training

442
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:32,000
you know if a patient comes in they're

443
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:34,039
diabetic and they're on insulin and they

444
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,779
want to be on cannabis like we need to

445
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,879
let them know that your blood sugar

446
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:39,409
could shift and you could become more

447
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:41,929
responsive to your insulin which is a

448
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:43,699
benefit however if you're injecting

449
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:44,989
yourself with insulin every day and you

450
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,280
don't realize and you're on the same

451
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,409
dose every day and you're not checking

452
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:51,139
your blood sugar often you may deal with

453
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:54,289
issues of low blood sugar if you're on

454
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:55,939
warfarin and which is a blood thinner it

455
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:57,829
could increase the effectiveness of your

456
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:01,370
warfarin these are things that patients

457
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,990
and and customers need to know and as an

458
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,549
industry we've done a very terrible job

459
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,750
of explaining this slowly for the fact

460
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:07,759
that the research is not readily

461
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,230
available to everyone but it's it's

462
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,390
getting there

463
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,099
and I also think that something that is

464
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:16,250
very unique about how we do things very

465
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:20,359
differently is solely just our hiring

466
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:22,640
methods and how we work and how we sift

467
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:24,619
through resumes and how we you know

468
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,990
bring on people to our team as an

469
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:28,489
introduction to where the entire team

470
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,589
isn't just like phase oh they're just

471
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,150
new personality here and it shifts

472
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:33,919
everything over and it can create bad

473
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,350
stuff around like everybody feels like

474
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,460
they get brought on as a team member so

475
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:39,349
they know that the whole team pretty

476
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,630
much I wanted them which makes them feel

477
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:43,849
great about coming to their job and the

478
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,500
rest of the team knows that they that

479
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:47,000
this is going to be a good candidate and

480
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,490
I think oftentimes just starting people

481
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,049
out if it starts on a bad note those are

482
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,549
employees that don't tend to last long

483
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:56,509
like they come into work dreading coming

484
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:57,680
into work their productivity shows so I

485
00:17:56,509 --> 00:18:00,229
think in general like our hiring

486
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,899
practices and

487
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:05,239
just our accounting practices are very

488
00:18:02,898 --> 00:18:06,798
different so we basically begin with we

489
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:08,149
go through resumes and we pick X amount

490
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,278
of candidates that we invite for a group

491
00:18:08,148 --> 00:18:11,628
interview so we usually hold it's a

492
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:13,069
little different because the volume of

493
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:14,898
the store but you we usually hold for

494
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:17,058
group interviews which we try and fill

495
00:18:14,898 --> 00:18:18,858
with as many people as possible and then

496
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:20,868
from that you know that's held with me

497
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:28,489
and then one of my other managers who

498
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:31,608
does a lot of scheduling it's ten

499
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:33,828
candidates with me and another one of my

500
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:35,509
might its assistant director and she's

501
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:37,009
in charge of mostly scheduling and

502
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:40,219
things like that so you sit down with

503
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:41,659
the two of us and we filter through we

504
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,338
ask you a bunch of fun questions like

505
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:45,469
Brett said we go off your resume so

506
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:47,239
everybody introduces themselves and why

507
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:48,649
they want to be in cannabis but after

508
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:50,259
that I'll pick from your resume hey

509
00:18:48,648 --> 00:18:54,078
you've worked twelve years in retail

510
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:56,838
tell me about an upset customer or you

511
00:18:54,078 --> 00:18:58,428
know you've been a paralegal that's we

512
00:18:56,838 --> 00:19:00,168
don't get a lot of those but sometimes

513
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,940
clerks and things like that you know

514
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:03,739
talk about different reporting

515
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,889
structures that you had to do in and how

516
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:08,778
you kept those organized you know so we

517
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:11,088
ask people specific questions to their

518
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:12,588
resume and it's great we learn a lot of

519
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:14,208
things we also try and touch base on

520
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:16,878
their cannabis knowledge do you know the

521
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:19,578
difference between THC and CBD indica

522
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:21,408
and sativa etc so from there we choose

523
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:23,209
our favorite candidates which return

524
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:25,159
then for a working interview now the

525
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:27,649
working interview is not done with me

526
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:28,999
and the my other manager who has done

527
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:30,468
the group interview this is done with

528
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:32,419
other members of management and then

529
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:34,609
with the team so they actually come in

530
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:36,919
and they spend two hours in a department

531
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:39,288
so sometimes they're more in reception

532
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:40,788
sometimes they're more in sales but

533
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:42,919
they're actually working alongside team

534
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:45,348
members I think the biggest benefit to

535
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,778
this is that who you say you are in a

536
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:50,118
job interview in front of people who you

537
00:19:47,778 --> 00:19:52,669
know are hiring managers and things like

538
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:55,759
that is sometimes very different than

539
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:57,409
how you act amongst your peers so this

540
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,028
has been I can't tell you how many times

541
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:01,429
I've loved a candidate and then somebody

542
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:03,950
else is like no they were you know rude

543
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:05,869
or unprofessional or all these other

544
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,879
things that comes from my team members

545
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:09,439
not just other members of management but

546
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:10,069
their peers the people that are going to

547
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,049
be working on

548
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:13,669
and they give examples of what the

549
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:15,740
situation you know just say like it from

550
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,210
a just a condescending way like oh I

551
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,920
just didn't like them like there's

552
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,390
actual proof behind that and that's

553
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,450
actually a best practice that I took

554
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:25,640
from veterinary industry because in

555
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,049
Texas you're not required to have a

556
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,509
license to work as a veterinary

557
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:32,750
technician or to run anesthesia or to

558
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:34,069
place IVs or anything like this and

559
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,230
there's multiple reasons for that and

560
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:38,480
it's also one reason why you know we

561
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:41,000
have Texas A&amp;M is the largest vet

562
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,549
schools and Texas it's a way for them to

563
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,349
actually work with more people and the

564
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:47,720
veterinary costs are significantly lower

565
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:49,219
there however hiring people is much more

566
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,690
difficult it's it's kind of like the

567
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,299
same ways when I was buying product

568
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,740
before that didn't have lab testing and

569
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:57,649
all these things like I had to require

570
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,240
all those things well when hiring vet

571
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,920
technicians they needed to come in and

572
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,240
show me that they knew how to place IVs

573
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,769
that they knew how to do these things

574
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,240
even though they may even have a license

575
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:07,009
that says that they they are registered

576
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,140
vet tech some of the registered vet

577
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:10,309
techs I knew could not place an IV to

578
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,530
save their life because they always

579
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:14,539
worked with a vet who placed them and so

580
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:16,099
there was a checklist of what we did and

581
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:19,039
it was a lot of it was you know vet tech

582
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:20,299
staff are very close-knit and if this

583
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,589
was not going to be a personality type

584
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:23,329
that worked well with it or they didn't

585
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:25,039
have the skills and to allow them to

586
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:27,259
work well with it it was gonna cause

587
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,519
issues so when I got into cannabis that

588
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:30,559
was such a foreign thing like you just

589
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:32,809
hired pretty girls like I gonna like no

590
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,700
now you actually force them into

591
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:37,369
stepping inside of their comfort zone

592
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,140
and big thing I look for to its critical

593
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:41,750
thinking skills or like okay so you came

594
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,640
from banking you were you know a bank

595
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,319
teller you did this like I need to know

596
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,680
that you can translate some of your

597
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:50,210
business practices over to this and and

598
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,289
I think that's in general I won't get on

599
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,840
that soapbox about critical thinking

600
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:55,629
skills in general suck most of the time

601
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,899
so where a lot of people especially

602
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:01,100
younger groups and I'll just be honest

603
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,230
well that is another thing like we do

604
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:06,829
get a lot of really young applicants so

605
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:09,170
trying to pull from other places to get

606
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:10,339
a truly more diverse workforce because I

607
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:13,160
know

608
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:14,990
patrons love to see like we have a lot

609
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,450
of older patrons yet they're always

610
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,039
talking to young staff members and it's

611
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,808
really hard to have you know someone

612
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,789
half your age tell you what's up and

613
00:22:20,808 --> 00:22:24,349
that there's there should it be

614
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:25,759
understanding for their training and

615
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:27,709
things like that there but I think it is

616
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,740
really important to make sure that your

617
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:33,350
staff does look like the diverse

618
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,670
population that you get a good sample so

619
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:37,039
that you know there's somebody that

620
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:38,990
pretty much everybody can relate to on

621
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,720
your sales floor and it allows for a lot

622
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:44,269
of empathy across the team of

623
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,819
understanding where what may work for

624
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:48,889
Brett who is epileptic and they don't

625
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:51,950
have it they're gonna you go off of what

626
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:55,910
works well for him and that's what we

627
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:58,460
also promote cross like but in doing

628
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,690
cross patient consulting we're bringing

629
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,058
on another but gender or a patient

630
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,820
consultant or customers assult a

631
00:23:02,058 --> 00:23:06,558
consultant to help on it with a patient

632
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:08,710
or a customer so that we can give that

633
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:12,470
that person the most well-rounded

634
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:14,390
experience but back to the interview

635
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,860
process they have to heard that working

636
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,509
interview that we go through where we

637
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:19,789
test for all these different skills and

638
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:22,160
I agree that it is it's good for current

639
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:23,720
employee morale because they feel as

640
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,769
though they have a little bit of say and

641
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,850
they're not just gonna somebody who's

642
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:27,589
gonna come in that they're not gonna

643
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:29,928
like you know they they feel so they're

644
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:31,939
part of building this team then after

645
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:34,220
they do that we have a 30 day a

646
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,808
probation period so you're gonna come in

647
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,789
and you're gonna work for us for 30 days

648
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:39,829
it's like an internship you're basically

649
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:41,839
going to get paid nothing and we're just

650
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:49,460
gonna make sure you can cut it no it's

651
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:50,959
it's above minimum wage no but we bring

652
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,730
them in at the Epis lower rate to make

653
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,440
sure that again that your weren't

654
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,759
feeding us lip service during your

655
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,350
interview that you're really someone

656
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,690
who's going to be a good fit for this

657
00:23:57,349 --> 00:24:01,490
team and anybody listening to this who's

658
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,440
actually been in a dispensary knows that

659
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,329
the the front lines you know what you're

660
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,340
seeing on this fails for is very

661
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:10,039
different from the vibe and back of

662
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:11,599
house you know so being able to be in

663
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:14,240
all of those sections and as much

664
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,798
it's an interview for us to make sure

665
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,720
that this is a good candidate I think

666
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:19,759
it's also an essential time for that

667
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,769
candidate to make sure that cannabis is

668
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,779
for them you know they might have

669
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:25,460
thought oh it's gonna be cool to work in

670
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:28,160
a dispensary but then the ins and outs

671
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,110
of being there and having to take

672
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,048
seriously something that maybe has been

673
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:35,119
only fun in your life is too much of a

674
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:37,910
transition so I think that 30-day period

675
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,619
is also super important and it's during

676
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,630
that time that you get your sexual

677
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:42,979
harassment training and your cannabis

678
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,840
training and you fill out all the

679
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,179
paperwork and all that and we can extend

680
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:50,089
the probationary period based on if

681
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:51,380
there were any issues had come up that

682
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:53,658
they weren't hitting the milestones that

683
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,490
we were needing them to hit and there's

684
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,960
where at the end of probationary period

685
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:59,390
we may decide that they're not a fit for

686
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,700
the team or we may feel that we need to

687
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,320
extend the probationary period so that

688
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,569
they can have a better understanding of

689
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:07,730
what we need from them and I think that

690
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:09,408
it that's prevented largely with good

691
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,669
communication so if we're every time

692
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:12,110
they're coming into work we're doing a

693
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:14,150
better job of like guiding them through

694
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:15,769
the process this is an industry that is

695
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,150
just regularly hired people just plug

696
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:20,150
and play and just let them learn on the

697
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:23,030
floor and that just doesn't work well in

698
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,798
general with any job mm-hmm what I think

699
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:26,509
is something that's unique about us is

700
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,240
just our accounting and our payroll

701
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:31,640
services you are getting a paycheck you

702
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,009
are getting pay stubs you know it's like

703
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,780
you paid your taxes your taxes not

704
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:37,849
getting hit with that event exactly like

705
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:39,740
we're paying our taxes for you you know

706
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:42,918
you know that we're paying employee

707
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,900
taxes and workman's comp which is very

708
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,970
different and so I think that's

709
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,169
something for us that is unique and it's

710
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,880
something that's been in my business

711
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:52,190
practices since I've got into this

712
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,440
industry so we know that payroll should

713
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:57,080
be realistically taking you know fifteen

714
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,610
to thirty percent of our budget and you

715
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,189
know if we're sitting there where we've

716
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:04,038
grown so much recently at times that

717
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:07,009
we're making up 10% or 11% of our budget

718
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:08,569
is payroll that is a key thing

719
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:10,009
forecasting high when we need to go and

720
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:12,079
say hey we need to hire people we're

721
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:13,788
sitting here only making a 11% of our

722
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,349
budget is going towards payroll that

723
00:26:13,788 --> 00:26:18,109
means we need to do raises and we need

724
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:19,849
to do hiring so that we can fill that

725
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,229
void because I know as much as like oh

726
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:22,250
I'm saving money and it's like no you're

727
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,250
really not because you're burning out

728
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:27,019
your staff and so for us it's an

729
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,019
and a big component to that is now

730
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:31,700
offering paid time off I myself took

731
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:33,710
vacation this summer for a week the last

732
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:37,548
week of June so I didn't have to be here

733
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:39,259
for the July 1st deadline and an Cassie

734
00:26:37,548 --> 00:26:41,779
just came back from vacation herself and

735
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:43,849
for us as directors we get burnt out

736
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:46,490
really quickly I mean we're working 50

737
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:48,709
60 hour weeks regularly and I'm

738
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,929
traveling significantly for my job as

739
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,700
well and I get burnt out and when I'm

740
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:55,159
able to just step away take a three or

741
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,830
four-day weekend and come back at it I'm

742
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:59,120
able to just my productivity soars and

743
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:01,069
we've noticed that if it's doing that

744
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:04,099
for me how could it not do that for the

745
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:06,349
rest of my staff I think another thing

746
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:07,908
unique to HR that I think we're doing a

747
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:09,678
lot of that I'm not sure is happening in

748
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:11,960
other dispensaries is performance

749
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,940
evaluations I mean you sit out with me

750
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,308
every couple of months and I fill out

751
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,070
the same form like ranking you know it's

752
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:20,029
like communication skills and

753
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:21,678
dependability I'd like all these

754
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:24,500
different things with places to comment

755
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:27,860
on it so in this way I can make sure I

756
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,808
sit down and I'm appreciative of my best

757
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:31,879
employees and then I can also help to

758
00:27:29,808 --> 00:27:33,200
develop someone who's struggling because

759
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,429
a lot of times as you're filling these

760
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,870
things out you realize okay I'm

761
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:37,788
frustrated with this employee because of

762
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:39,379
her tardiness or something like that but

763
00:27:37,788 --> 00:27:41,808
then there's all these other fabulous

764
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:45,380
skills that they bring to the table so

765
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:47,298
how do I reach her on this and having

766
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,860
that one-to-one time and mentorship and

767
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:51,139
things like that are really helpful with

768
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:53,359
that so again I feel like it's something

769
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,070
I'm teased by with my team like we're

770
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,849
gonna sit down and read this paper again

771
00:27:55,069 --> 00:28:00,408
but I think in general it does it they

772
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:02,899
feel more confident that they're gonna

773
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:05,059
have time to know how they're doing to

774
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:09,200
ask me any questions to give me feedback

775
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:11,658
about how it you know the the company

776
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,460
culture is feeling for them I think is

777
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:15,679
really important and something that I

778
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,480
don't see a lot you know that routine

779
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,250
evaluations I see people do them when

780
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,860
somebody's either troublesome or getting

781
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,509
a raise I'm not seeing that say I didn't

782
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:26,089
see it in the past with those two things

783
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:27,919
and and which I do when I'm doing a

784
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:29,689
written warning which is not very often

785
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,340
what I do I do a performance evaluation

786
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:35,509
but largely that's actually just as

787
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:36,769
important to me as it is to them so it

788
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:38,599
allows me that when I

789
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:41,359
go into this copy having this

790
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:42,740
conversation that I'm not doing it from

791
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,449
a perspective where I'm like I'm mad

792
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,370
about this specific thing like it's

793
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,170
allowed it allows for me to give much

794
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:50,089
more constructive criticism like you're

795
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:51,500
doing wonderful in this area like I see

796
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:53,569
the skills that you're applying to this

797
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,150
take those same skills and apply it to

798
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:57,889
this area so that you can feel that

799
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,900
deficit and that's what's causing you to

800
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,670
have this write up right now so

801
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,680
performance evaluations aren't even

802
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:05,660
they're not just necessary quarterly or

803
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,080
every couple of months or depending on

804
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:11,690
the employees that is even it's used to

805
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,609
allow the the manager to have a better

806
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:16,009
discussion about the changes that they

807
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:17,779
need to see in the employee and I think

808
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:19,099
one thing I just kind of touched on a

809
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:21,470
little bit that's really important is I

810
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:23,569
also really appreciate feedback from my

811
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,460
customer assistance I want to hear what

812
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:27,889
their thoughts are I've heard so many

813
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:30,230
creative and innovative ideas in these

814
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:32,570
meetings you know where they're not

815
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:35,120
always sure how to speak up about hey

816
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:36,500
you know at my old job we had inventory

817
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:37,729
and we did it this way

818
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,109
they're not always sure how to talk to

819
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,789
me about that but the performance

820
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:42,559
evaluation is that perfect time when

821
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:45,139
they have my undivided attention and

822
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,450
that stuff really comes out and I think

823
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,370
that that's really important because it

824
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:51,470
allows you to see who your staff really

825
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:53,599
is because not everybody is super

826
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,309
extroverted but like gonna hit you over

827
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,509
the head with their skills you know some

828
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:58,909
people need a little bit more

829
00:29:56,509 --> 00:30:01,759
development and they still have great

830
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:03,380
ideas they still should be implementing

831
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:05,089
them but they just don't always feel

832
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,280
confident in talking about it so taking

833
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:08,779
that time to sit down one-on-one you can

834
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,629
really get a feel for who your best team

835
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:24,058
members are

836
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:24,059
