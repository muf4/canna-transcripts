[Music]

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:16,760
foreign

3
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:20,579
[Music]

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,460
okay perfect so I'm here with Scott wall

5
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,618
and Jenny garley hi from New Age Labs

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,439
you came in all the way from Michigan

7
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:32,340
you're in NorCal in the Salinas area but

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,960
you both just presented and I only

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,520
caught the end of yours and there are

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,219
specific topics that I want to talk

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,840
about but can you kind of give like a

12
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,100
recap of the key points you wanted

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,320
people to take away for your

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,140
presentation sure

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,420
um I just went over

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,239
Why Stop is op is important how

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,539
ever from tissue I broke down the

18
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:57,238
different components of esophonalysis uh

19
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,539
looked at especially Mobility Trace

20
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:04,018
elements cations anions the balances

21
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,840
synergism antagonism and then nitrogen

22
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,000
reduction breakdown so somebody can look

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,740
at a sap analysis and not just see a

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,140
whole bunch of bars but have an

25
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:16,199
understanding of each nutrient so they

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,420
can take it to the next level with God

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,460
so if you think of kind of tools in a

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,680
toolkit there's like soil samples

29
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:28,019
there's plant sap analysis there's

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,700
tissue analysis and in terms of

31
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,500
like I think a lot of people kind of

32
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,759
want to get a sense of that round trip

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,978
of I know it's in my soil I know how

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,959
successful my plants are and uptaking

35
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,640
whatever is in there there's enough of

36
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,419
everything

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,579
um can you kind of talk about

38
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,399
Eric come here you're going to tap in

39
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:52,258
for me you ready

40
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,939
so I just started asking the very first

41
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,540
question which was around Jenny's

42
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:56,539
presentation

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,240
oh he was a Clapper of yours I would

44
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:09,060
have Eric tap in yes yes tap it in

45
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,159
so what did what did you find what were

46
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,140
your takeaways

47
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,239
uh well I'm I'm definitely into

48
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,859
analyzing and lab testing and I find

49
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,140
that a lot of Harms in commercial

50
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,260
cannabis don't test anything for any

51
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,179
amount of whatever they're doing and so

52
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:26,340
um the explanation of how it's collected

53
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,500
and how the process that you guys use is

54
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,378
really I think informative and important

55
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,000
and I think more people

56
00:02:30,378 --> 00:02:35,159
if they'd understand how easy sometimes

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,139
this process is and how valuable it is

58
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,759
they do it more but a lot of people turn

59
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:41,339
it into a headache and I find a lot of

60
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,259
farms are more pessimistic than they are

61
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,878
optimistics and so they look at ways

62
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,098
that something won't work before they

63
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,018
even try it and so I feel like as a

64
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:51,439
consultant that's one of the tougher

65
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:56,280
challenges is to get people to be

66
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:58,500
optimistic about new things and data and

67
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,239
stuff like that so I mean I think that

68
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,539
was a great aspect of your presentation

69
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,099
yeah absolutely I mean we you know

70
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:07,318
I mean we're talking about cannabis

71
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:09,359
today right but

72
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,179
the perfect example like in blueberries

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,800
I years ago I had a blueberry grower

74
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,860
come talk to me about the fact that they

75
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,780
were losing 225 thousand dollars a year

76
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,480
in soft fruit

77
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,158
so we put together a plan that would

78
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,219
have cost about fifteen thousand dollars

79
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,780
a year for sap analysis on 11 different

80
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:31,560
fields that would have been indicators

81
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,719
for them to improve their fruit quality

82
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,378
the response back from that grower was

83
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:40,199
well that's too expensive so he was

84
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:42,840
unwilling to pay fifteen thousand

85
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:46,139
dollars on a plan that would have helped

86
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,959
him remove a loss of a quarter of a

87
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,298
million dollars in Lost Revenue that's

88
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,860
insane and it's like an insurance policy

89
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,840
basically you're buying a fifteen

90
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,080
thousand dollar insurance policy

91
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,640
basically and yep exactly yeah it's

92
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,319
tough and I like to listen into your

93
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,839
presentation as well because you brought

94
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,639
up a couple of key factors and

95
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,979
um it wasn't necessarily on the data

96
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,479
side but uh what I resonated with was

97
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,719
the fact that a lot of things look good

98
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,219
on paper and and it doesn't do out

99
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,858
on the farm you get out there and

100
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:19,079
nothing works right workflow whatever it

101
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:21,120
is it's just not right and it looks

102
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,579
great on paper and that really is a

103
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,439
testament to the wrong people designing

104
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:27,120
and dealing with these facilities they

105
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,800
weren't farmers in the first place maybe

106
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680
Real Estate Investors they can raise

107
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,439
money but putting together a harm is

108
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,019
really out of everybody's league and we

109
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,000
see it I think at the end yeah it bites

110
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:42,719
them in the ass a little bit well you

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,418
know the the thing was it you know

112
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,460
put the Legacy grow

113
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:49,740
you know away we we knew what we were

114
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,418
doing in Legacy but when we went to

115
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,978
legalize cannabis

116
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:54,959
there are a whole lot of people that

117
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:56,699
jumped into industry state by state

118
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,939
every time it phased in a whole new

119
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:03,540
group of people jumped into the industry

120
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:05,879
Builders HVAC people you name it and

121
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,340
they're it there's a lot of predatory

122
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,879
behaviors in all those Industries

123
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:14,579
and so you see grows you see amendments

124
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,079
you see HVAC you see irrigation

125
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:17,939
that

126
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,219
that might have been fine for the

127
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,719
industry that that person was associated

128
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,900
with

129
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,259
but and it may maybe it made sense on

130
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:30,478
paper and the investor or the the person

131
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,280
that had the money said

132
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,339
okay I'll buy that

133
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:38,819
it makes sense but it doesn't make sense

134
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:40,339
when in practicality 100 can you give a

135
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:43,978
green

136
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:46,019
HVAC like a traditional HVAC system with

137
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:48,060
chillers and Air Handlers going into a

138
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,758
greenhouse which typically isn't part of

139
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,339
greenhouse technology and traditional AG

140
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,020
you know there's wet walls there's you

141
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,659
know passive or natural ventilation and

142
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:59,698
that's pretty much it there's not HVAC

143
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,560
because tomatoes aren't worth that much

144
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,240
money they're they're a great crop but

145
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,879
they're not worth as much as cannabis

146
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,519
and so cannabis went into this area of

147
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,839
more is more you know like here at these

148
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,079
conferences and what we're all talking

149
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,879
about in some cases is less is more but

150
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,639
the industry started taking them more as

151
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,620
more approach and so with controlled

152
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,418
environment agriculture it was like well

153
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,160
I want more control so we're putting

154
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:24,899
more equipment in it but the equipment

155
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,460
suppliers never done the math on

156
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,099
something like that because there's no

157
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:31,560
calculations for HVAC with something

158
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,259
that has solar gain so we're seeing

159
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,220
equipment that's underpowered

160
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,720
relationships are broken because the

161
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,039
people that bought the stuff are pissed

162
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,600
at the people supplying it but the

163
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,478
people supplying it are like hey we've

164
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,759
never done that before so we have a

165
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,038
vicious cycle of everybody wanting to

166
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,400
help each other but they're doing it out

167
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:53,279
of a pretense of of maybe trying to you

168
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,258
know set new standards set new records

169
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,418
make a name for themselves or just make

170
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,580
a bunch of money real quick go in for

171
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:02,099
the kill and then come out of it going

172
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,439
oops we up or maybe that wasn't

173
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:08,759
such a good idea exactly and the problem

174
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:12,538
is every time we legalize in a new state

175
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:15,300
the the price per pound the price point

176
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:18,240
is huge so business plans are based on

177
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,000
these really big price point so

178
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,038
everything works you can you can afford

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,680
anything

180
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:28,259
and so you design these things then they

181
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,418
don't work the IPM is terrible now

182
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:32,160
you're getting powdery mildew occurring

183
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:33,839
every time you can't control the

184
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,660
humidity

185
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,038
the investors now the price point starts

186
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,599
going down because more and more people

187
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,459
are getting into it

188
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,139
you're not harvesting what you thought

189
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,519
you were going to harvest you're not

190
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,780
getting the price that you thought you

191
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,318
were going to get you're having to buy

192
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:51,359
more technology to treat for mediocre

193
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,860
cannabis really

194
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,439
and

195
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,720
now the business plan doesn't work and

196
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,719
the investors are getting pissed off now

197
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,539
they're firing management and it's a and

198
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,060
now you're getting this cycle that is

199
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:09,300
just it it feeds on itself it's like

200
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,939
cannibalism and those facilities

201
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,620
are I think are just doomed for failure

202
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:15,538
you know

203
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,399
um I think the the new states that are

204
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:19,560
coming on board need to really be

205
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:22,318
examining what's going on in the other

206
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,819
states and say okay look we know we're

207
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,400
going to get to a point where our price

208
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,319
point is going to be

209
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,959
eight hundred dollars a pound

210
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,580
make your business plan based on that

211
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,139
figure out what you're how you're going

212
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,639
to get return on investment based on

213
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,038
that

214
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,379
and and look at the failures in those

215
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:41,458
other states and plan accordingly don't

216
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:43,379
plan on

217
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,699
and if you're making if you're selling

218
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:47,399
at twenty five hundred dollars a pound

219
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,759
Great take that money and Bank it don't

220
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,419
go buy new Escalades and everything else

221
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,338
you know

222
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:56,939
Bank it because you're going to need it

223
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,980
someday get your Sops right and and

224
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,700
stick to it

225
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,920
um

226
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,060
don't blame everything on the guys that

227
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,759
are on the

228
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,500
rolls downhill right well don't

229
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,720
always blame the guy below because a lot

230
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,820
of the times the problems occur at the

231
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,320
top of the hill it's the manager it's

232
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,760
the guy that doesn't know a thing about

233
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,740
grow but he's the one who putting the

234
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,720
money in and they come in and they make

235
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,980
a lot of changes sometimes they don't

236
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,480
know a thing about what they're doing

237
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,580
well I think what happens too is

238
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,259
originally they start out like you said

239
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,879
and then they hire a bunch of people

240
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:28,080
that blew a lot of smoke up their ass

241
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,120
because they can talk a bunch of

242
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,800
cannabis talk and all that talk but

243
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,679
really don't have the experience maybe

244
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:36,539
the book book experienced and trained

245
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:39,379
really well and they can recite a lot of

246
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:41,458
you mean the major Growers yeah

247
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,259
we were talking about LinkedIn last

248
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,939
night and there was somebody in in the

249
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,278
comments and they said something about a

250
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,019
master grower and I said oh that's kind

251
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,000
of made a joke in the comments back I

252
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,278
was like Master grower LOL or whatever

253
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,899
and the dude was like well maybe the

254
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,639
terminology is different out there in

255
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,220
California but we grow the best pot here

256
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,958
in Colorado and you know by Master

257
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,339
Growers or whatever and I was like man

258
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,000
okay

259
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,839
um

260
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,639
enjoy the little bubble you live in but

261
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,260
nevertheless what ends up happening

262
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,000
though is upper management feels like

263
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,679
they have to take over and make all

264
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,080
these decisions and so a lot of times

265
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,759
what we're seeing also is that the

266
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,379
beginning of everything failed because

267
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,759
they didn't vet the people right and

268
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:22,379
they didn't know how in the first place

269
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,819
you know a lot of these people made

270
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:25,500
their money in real estate and other

271
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,480
businesses and they were like okay now

272
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,339
we're going to ship to cannabis and

273
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,839
everything really falls apart and it's

274
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,279
you know number one because they didn't

275
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,320
know how to vet people and then number

276
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,059
two they try to take control of the

277
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,399
situation because originally they are

278
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:41,039
the smarter people of the group and then

279
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,919
they compound it with making terrible

280
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,599
decisions right right based on what they

281
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,879
learned on Instagram or something well

282
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,040
and I think that's that's exactly it you

283
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,659
know we're in we're in an industry right

284
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:55,620
now that is

285
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:57,958
trying to produce a lot of cannabis

286
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,839
and it should be our goal is to produce

287
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:04,078
exceptional cannabis at the lowest at

288
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,540
the lowest cost per pound so that we

289
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,819
make a good margin

290
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,500
but it's exceptional and I think what

291
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,200
we're actually doing is producing a lot

292
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:16,799
of mediocre cannabis oh yeah and it's

293
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,660
not always at at a good margin no no and

294
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,639
I think in California I hate to say it

295
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:22,740
because this is where I'm from and I

296
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,419
love California Cannabis it's like you

297
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,039
know that's where my heart is but

298
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:28,199
unfortunately it's getting a little

299
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,699
boofier midsy out here because the price

300
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,860
of cannabis and the way that the

301
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,420
legalization has turned people have to

302
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,399
grow cheaper and cheaper which has

303
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:37,620
caused a big learning curve you know

304
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,419
switching the regenerative AG is a great

305
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,740
idea and living soil and all these

306
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:42,958
things but it does come with a little

307
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,659
bit of a learning curve people that

308
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,278
maybe were regenerative AG or maybe just

309
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:49,078
organic let's say not necessarily

310
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,539
regenerative and living soil but they

311
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,819
switch to cocoa and salts a little bit

312
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:55,860
of a learning curve Legacy Growers up

313
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,200
north that really always Grew From seed

314
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,539
never had a problem nobody wants those

315
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,759
strains it's based on a hype strain they

316
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:04,019
go and buy a bunch of clones nobody's

317
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,059
really grown clones before and

318
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,039
understand the sensitivity that for you

319
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,259
know as so there's a learning curve

320
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,120
there and so you know this last year was

321
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,159
the year of we can't anything up

322
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,899
everything's got to go perfectly and it

323
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,360
was actually the year of tons of

324
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,100
ups and so it was a really unfortunate

325
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,500
disastrous year for a lot of the

326
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,180
learning curve Farms I guess you could

327
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,980
say in some of those categories and in

328
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,559
other areas it was a great year because

329
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,420
we had such a long warm summer we didn't

330
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,000
have the early rain so a lot of The

331
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:35,219
Growers were able to get a great crop in

332
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,019
but like I said in between all that were

333
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,180
a bunch of learning curves and stumbling

334
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,980
blocks and so it's really great to have

335
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,899
this event again because some of the

336
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,220
other

337
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:47,700
conferences you know aren't happening

338
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,560
anymore what I find is that the trade

339
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,720
shows used to be centered around the

340
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,458
Growers back in the days max yield and

341
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,160
some of those things and now it's all

342
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:58,138
shifted towards the investment and upper

343
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,539
management and these kind of flashy

344
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,700
showy things like MJ bizcon and so to be

345
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:05,399
able to have this and you know speak to

346
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,019
the farmers and engage is really great

347
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,000
because you can only do that and January

348
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,860
and February also otherwise everybody's

349
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,240
busy yeah and nobody's really thirsting

350
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,519
for info because they're in the trenches

351
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,500
well and I think that's what we're you

352
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,959
know when when I'm talking with grows

353
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,179
and typically a lot of times when when

354
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,278
they ask us to come in

355
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:25,039
to start with sap analysis usually

356
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,600
they've got a problem to start with

357
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,278
nobody usually starts with sap analysis

358
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,759
when everything's going right sure we do

359
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,759
not get called

360
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:37,138
I'm just gonna throw this in right right

361
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:39,599
but you know the the thought is okay

362
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,879
we're gonna fix everything all at one

363
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,500
time and that's it's never that's never

364
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:48,838
a good science as a as a numbers nerd

365
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,220
that you've got to first convince them

366
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,019
look

367
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,240
I see what you've got

368
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,159
now I want you to make two lists make a

369
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,620
list of all the problems you you

370
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,439
perceive in your growth all right then

371
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,778
make a list of all your strains and list

372
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,860
them in priority if you fix this strain

373
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:07,139
first it would make the biggest

374
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,300
difference in your bottom line and down

375
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:12,659
to the to the lowest strain that you

376
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:14,159
give the the least about yep now

377
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:15,778
would take those two and we make a

378
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,600
matrix and we say okay we're going to

379
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:20,458
work on these two strains first and

380
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,440
these are the two issues we want to

381
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:25,018
tackle first

382
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,880
and we focus on changing one parameter

383
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:29,220
at a time yeah yeah that's science

384
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,500
that's good science yeah yeah and now we

385
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,000
can work on that and so you don't want

386
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,700
to be changing a whole lot of different

387
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,879
things at once the guy that wants to

388
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,278
change seed and HVAC and this and that

389
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,639
it's too much never figured out yeah can

390
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:43,639
you give it

391
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:50,459
anything to see kind of the effects oh

392
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,519
sure

393
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,518
um

394
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,320
irrigate yes very irrigation absolutely

395
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:01,740
I think irrigation is perfect if you're

396
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,040
if you have a automated irrigation

397
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,560
system depending on your dry vac okay if

398
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:10,198
you if you allow too much dry vac and

399
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,479
you're counting on good microbial growth

400
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:14,698
you drive back too much you're you're

401
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,220
allowing the microbes to die off

402
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:19,799
well you're defeating your point so if

403
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,540
you if you don't irrigate properly the

404
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:26,479
microbes die back but you're counting on

405
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:28,799
the microbes to facilitate uh phosphorus

406
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,579
mineralization in the in the rise of

407
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,219
Fear

408
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:34,739
well you could have all the phosphorus

409
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,440
you want available in that root Zone but

410
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,039
your uptake with sap indicates that you

411
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,760
have a deficiency and uptake so now that

412
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,759
one management

413
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,139
practice

414
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:51,719
is affecting the uptake that you want in

415
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:53,759
your finished product and

416
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,040
the fact that you have a deficiency in

417
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,379
the phosphorus uptake is opening up the

418
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,240
door for other problems like maybe the

419
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:03,240
plant's known to take up more chloride

420
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,980
and now you you create an imbalance you

421
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,799
didn't want the chloride but now the

422
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,259
chloride is so high that even if you fix

423
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:13,919
the irrigation problem there's so much

424
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:16,220
chloride in the in that one grow of 200

425
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,479
strain of 200 plants in that constraint

426
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,879
you've got to now fix the fact that

427
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,740
you've got so much chloride uptake so

428
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,838
you've created a problem that created

429
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,839
another problem that you if you even fix

430
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,760
it's a domino effect exactly with the

431
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,720
solution to the first problem you

432
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,159
basically more frequent small like

433
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,259
smaller waterings with more frequency

434
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,259
like what would be the solution to that

435
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,879
dryback period that's killing too much

436
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:44,820
it might be more frequent smaller

437
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:47,519
waterings which but

438
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,800
it would be inappropriate for me to ever

439
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,980
say this is the solution to that one

440
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:56,039
problem in general for all grows

441
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,320
there are 250 different grow operations

442
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,120
here everybody is doing it a little bit

443
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,000
differently and until

444
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,919
if somebody calls and says uh you look

445
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,539
we just did this sap analysis and I and

446
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,919
we and I'd say yeah you've got this

447
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,019
problem in this problem

448
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,419
and they say okay so what do I do I

449
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:15,078
don't know because I don't know your bro

450
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:18,900
I don't know what you're doing so until

451
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:20,578
I come and visit or we have a in-depth

452
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,860
conversation about what's your

453
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:25,259
management practices are and you have to

454
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:28,379
be a hundred percent honest with me

455
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:30,779
I can't give you any advice and I won't

456
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,520
I won't even try to give you advice to

457
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:34,918
say hey this is I think something that

458
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:37,440
we need to look at but we're only going

459
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,600
to work at one parameter at a time and

460
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,660
then then we'll do more and you're going

461
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,339
to give me speed honestly yeah yeah you

462
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,259
know that's that's where I get in

463
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:48,599
trouble yeah with complete honesty

464
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:51,058
because there are things that I don't

465
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:55,139
agree with in the Cannabis industry but

466
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:58,038
Bro Science says this is what you do

467
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,038
Association

468
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,019
okay

469
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,259
so yeah you see you're just gonna you're

470
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:06,319
just trying to get 50 of the P or 75 of

471
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:10,579
the people out there to hate me

472
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,579
this is come on so

473
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,740
so our industry as a whole

474
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,519
has come to the understanding that we

475
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:23,519
need to defoliate

476
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,859
and we defoliate hard particularly in in

477
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,679
controlled environmental agriculture so

478
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:31,678
in our indoor Grows Where basically our

479
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:34,440
HVAC systems cannot handle humidity

480
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,240
so the engineering is bad

481
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,519
it's not the plant that's bad it's not

482
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,140
the IPM that's bad it's the engineering

483
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,619
that's bad

484
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:47,100
we at three weeks and probably at 40 at

485
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:48,779
21 days and at 42 days we go in and we

486
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:51,119
we

487
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:54,298
call it training and we call it

488
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:56,459
defoliating and we pull all these leaves

489
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:58,679
off well

490
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,259
we would take out lateral branches

491
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,400
we're taking out

492
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:05,099
a

493
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,120
the the factories of the plant okay

494
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:12,779
those leaves are the only place that

495
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:14,579
that the plant can produce organic

496
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:19,019
molecules but the very thing that we're

497
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:20,418
trying to produce so sugars uh terpenes

498
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:23,339
THC

499
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:24,840
enzymatics proteins all these things can

500
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:28,139
produce in the leaves

501
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:30,119
there also are solar cells that collect

502
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,679
the energy that we're paying electricity

503
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,199
for

504
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,880
and so you know

505
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,900
we go in and we take them all out well

506
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,480
we spent money on energy and amendments

507
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,660
and everything to grow that leaf and

508
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,480
that leaf is holding mobile nutrients so

509
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,340
we strip it away we throw away money

510
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,599
we throw away the factories that are

511
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:53,519
going to produce make that plant

512
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:57,240
healthier and stronger and more terpes

513
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:59,400
and more THC more Bud more Bud swell

514
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,380
because it all has to come from the

515
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,259
factories

516
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,380
so I tell the Growers stop defoliating

517
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:10,079
not entirely just enough to maintain

518
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,120
good IPM

519
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,558
um

520
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,719
can you talk about your example of the

521
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:16,579
lower leaves that they only get 200 sure

522
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,960
yeah

523
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:21,899
but first I want to say what a mobile

524
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,840
nutrient is so when you're throwing away

525
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,480
those older leaves and Scott said

526
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:32,579
throwing away mobiles your mobile

527
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:34,740
nutrients is nkk magnesium and sulfur so

528
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:36,960
those if you're paying money to put

529
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,359
those in the leaves when you defoliate

530
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,980
you're also throwing them away so that's

531
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:46,619
immobile yeah calcium immobile right yes

532
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:49,440
where Calcium deficiency is seen at the

533
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:51,959
top of the leaf as where mobile nutrient

534
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,419
deficiencies are seen at the bottom of

535
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,519
the plant so you know

536
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:59,038
so many Growers when I go through and I

537
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,418
do a tour then I usually have like four

538
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,460
or five people and there's there's

539
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:03,780
Junior Growers and there's there's the

540
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,940
head cultivator and they say well

541
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:08,639
shouldn't I shouldn't I clean out these

542
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,798
leaves on the inside because it's

543
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,900
causing shadowing and so on and so forth

544
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,759
and and I've measured I've measured

545
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:18,900
light absorption in the inside and it's

546
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:20,460
only 200 you know Photon flux units in

547
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,880
the inside

548
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,519
and they're like no why well it's only

549
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,740
200 and up here at the top it's 800 or a

550
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:31,019
thousand I said yeah but if you take

551
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,880
that out that's 200 that you don't

552
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:36,240
capture ever

553
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,299
and it just goes to nothing you're

554
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,099
paying for it capture it that leaf is

555
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,298
gonna get that 200 and turn it into

556
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,459
something

557
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:46,400
um you know that's why we put the mylar

558
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:51,120
down

559
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:53,700
I mean an oak tree or you know a plant

560
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,798
growing out in the in a forest doesn't

561
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,980
just drop all the leaves on the inside

562
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:00,900
of its canopy it it keeps every leak so

563
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,538
long as it's got nutrients it keeps that

564
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:06,360
leaf because every little bit of UV

565
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:09,658
energy that it can collect goes towards

566
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:11,879
its production of sugars and metabolites

567
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:14,039
so as long as it's green don't start

568
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,080
pulling it up totally agree if it's and

569
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:17,400
then if it's starting to finesse and

570
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,918
it's at the bottom

571
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,259
and you if if it's there and you see

572
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,360
this in essence that's the language of

573
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:26,038
that plant telling you we're losing

574
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,259
we're stripping nutrients out of that

575
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:30,058
leaf you've got a deficiency problem if

576
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:32,158
you strip those leaves out before that

577
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:34,918
happens you're losing some some

578
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,960
communication with that plant so there's

579
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:40,080
there's no sense in it that's awesome I

580
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,840
love hearing all that stuff because yeah

581
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:45,839
more more it's so interesting because I

582
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,879
in My Bro Science head I always think

583
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,038
that that's a natural function of like

584
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,720
lower the feeds yellow and that's

585
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,000
natural but you're saying that it

586
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,179
doesn't always happen you know no it

587
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,919
doesn't a a a a healthy plant doesn't

588
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:02,038
have to get rid of lower leaves just

589
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:07,080
because they're older leaves it gets

590
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:10,200
right now because UV UV light light

591
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:12,599
particles don't behave the way we think

592
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,240
just because it's in Shadow doesn't mean

593
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:18,298
it's not getting light it just means

594
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,579
it's getting less UV but absorbing any

595
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:23,940
UV I mean when we talk about like the

596
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:27,298
Spectra on these lights they go from 300

597
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,980
to 800 you know that big broad Spectra

598
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:31,079
we want to collect as much of it as

599
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,700
possible it's bouncing around let's get

600
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,139
it you know let's pick up as much as

601
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,298
possible

602
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,880
um and you know people say well that

603
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:40,918
least caused taking more energy

604
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,340
is taking energy away from the top spot

605
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,980
no it's not that leaf already was grown

606
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:49,918
it's been produced it's collecting

607
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:53,220
energy it's doing something it's feeding

608
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,860
that bud if it's it when it starts dying

609
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:59,400
out the plants actually taking nutrients

610
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:01,859
away from it and taking it to the to the

611
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,419
butter to that new growth point then you

612
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,158
know that you don't need that leaf

613
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,840
anymore but you're also figuring out

614
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,179
that you've got some other issues going

615
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:11,939
on but we take all those we take all

616
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:13,679
that stuff away and at 42 days

617
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,600
when we're really in the home stretch

618
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,480
and we should be looking at nutrient

619
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,459
uptake we strip so many leaves away it's

620
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,339
almost impossible to figure out what our

621
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:26,340
nutrient uptake is yeah and and you're

622
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:28,740
you're cool with training oh yeah I

623
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:30,178
totally agree with training I think I

624
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,058
think there's some cool things I mean

625
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,980
I've seen cannabis bonsai trees and I

626
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:36,839
think I think they're fantastic I think

627
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:40,259
there's a ton of stuff we can do with

628
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:42,599
with training to open up light paths to

629
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:46,140
the center of a tree the question is can

630
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:47,459
we afford the labor to do it you know in

631
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,400
my laboratory

632
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:53,100
the the biggest cost in my facility is

633
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,740
labor 50 of my cost comes from labor

634
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:58,439
well when we're trying to struggle for

635
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,720
cost return on investment and cost or

636
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,759
price per pound

637
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,720
these guys you know facilities that have

638
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:09,240
8 10 people in a in a section working

639
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,519
two days a week pulling leaves off of

640
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,859
plants

641
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,379
um that to me looks like a labor saving

642
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:18,658
someplace let's minimize some of that

643
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:23,820
cost right there

644
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:25,740
um and if we if we've got a IPM issue

645
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:28,079
let's figure out what the real cause of

646
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,120
that is you know if it's if it's a

647
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,319
fungal issue if it's a yeast and mold

648
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,479
issue

649
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:36,599
figure out your vectors of how that's

650
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,700
getting into the facility you know we

651
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:40,980
build these fancy

652
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,120
super elaborate controlled environmental

653
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,120
agriculture facilities

654
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:49,500
you know we put on Scrubs we put on you

655
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,179
know if I go visit they make me put on

656
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,460
Tyvek right

657
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:58,340
and I go through an air booth and I put

658
00:25:53,460 --> 00:26:01,740
on booties and I walk in and

659
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:03,720
I see Growers handling plants without

660
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,778
gloves on

661
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,579
and we talk about swabbing and we talk

662
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:10,980
about all these things and I'm like

663
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:12,538
you know you worry about protritis I

664
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,179
don't see anybody here with a face mask

665
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:17,220
on arthritis is is on your skin and so

666
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:18,600
on and so forth you want to get these

667
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,400
things out figure out what your vectors

668
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:23,519
are for these things that get into your

669
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,380
get in you know if you were a food

670
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,200
processing facility

671
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,940
as a food a food safety consultant I

672
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,759
want to see your food safety plans I

673
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,278
want I want you to know what your your

674
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:38,460
traffic patterns are

675
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,140
um if you're a CAA you've got a loading

676
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,600
dock because you're receiving materials

677
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,400
well sometimes that those materials need

678
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:46,678
to go into your grow facility do you

679
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,720
have two different pallet jacks one for

680
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,580
your Dock and one and a clean one that

681
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,159
only goes into your grow because if the

682
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:55,918
one from your dock that went on the

683
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:58,620
truck and trucks are dirty also goes

684
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,659
down the hallway to your in your grow

685
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:03,959
your flower roast you're just that's a

686
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:05,520
vector that that brings in pathogens

687
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,340
because that truck went to other farms

688
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,679
and that means that other Farms

689
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:13,379
pallet jack went on that truck

690
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:16,320
so you want to look for vectors for or

691
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,039
tritus and hop latent virus and

692
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:19,558
um

693
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,960
well the stripping is a huge hop late

694
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:23,460
and viroid you know spreader event

695
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,558
basically because you have all these

696
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,360
people in there stripping all these

697
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:29,759
leaves getting all this all over

698
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,678
yeah and they don't change their gloves

699
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,480
honestly I watch people I'll sit there

700
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,200
and audit some of these processes and

701
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,360
then

702
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,038
it's break time okay everybody's

703
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:39,599
touching the door handles everybody's

704
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:42,179
touching everything and a lot of the

705
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,399
workers it's amazing how they want to

706
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,720
save gloves or protect you know like

707
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,820
they're going to save the farm a couple

708
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,460
bucks by reusing the gloves or putting

709
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:52,500
them and so uh going from strain to

710
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,840
strain same pluckings a lot of what you

711
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,640
were saying also about having too many

712
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,859
strains in one room because they don't

713
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,480
all eat and drink the same and a lot of

714
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:01,740
the Farms try to claim that they're data

715
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,360
driven but they're not because they're

716
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,798
growing all the same strains they don't

717
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,538
know what eats and drinks differently

718
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,879
right they're not doing any of the

719
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:10,558
testing that you guys provide or any of

720
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,900
that kind of stuff the only data driven

721
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,519
I find is that they're monitoring their

722
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,038
dry back so they're not even doing that

723
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,200
right and so like to your point you know

724
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:22,319
the dry backs are this big

725
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,480
you know uh achievement to try to get to

726
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,399
which is a lack of moisture in the long

727
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,798
run so it's a lack of

728
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,240
Mobility for nutrients in a lot of ways

729
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,519
and so like you were saying for the

730
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,019
first steps of things I'm kind of in the

731
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:35,339
same boat so if the plants aren't

732
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:37,558
looking good let's make sure the

733
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:39,839
irrigation is right and they're hydrated

734
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:41,460
yep and then secondly then we can start

735
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,019
to look at okay if the hydration is

736
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,419
right and we don't see a change for the

737
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:47,400
better or things are still continuing we

738
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:49,740
move on to maybe the nutrients and

739
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,640
definitely sending things in for testing

740
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,500
but

741
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,480
again a lot of people will be

742
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,919
pessimistic and say the testing or not

743
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,019
know how to look at the testing because

744
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,460
of the closest lab that doesn't really

745
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:01,798
give you any kind of results that no

746
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,298
anybody knows how to decipher

747
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:05,460
um and so then that gets thrown out the

748
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:07,558
window and and it really gets tough and

749
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,960
the stripping of the plants is has

750
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:12,538
gotten crazy like I don't I don't know

751
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,759
if it's Instagram or what's caused

752
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:16,798
everybody to go to this crazy amount of

753
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:18,839
stripping but it's happened to be from

754
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:21,119
here to the East Coast with Farms that

755
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:22,740
you know will even say at times what we

756
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,359
have to do it or the plants will get key

757
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,220
in but I look at the plants and they're

758
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:28,319
covered in pm at Lake flower and I'm

759
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,659
like how do you how does that hold up

760
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,879
like how can that you know reasoning

761
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:36,360
stand hold water if your plants already

762
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,820
have PM so like stripping them down and

763
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:40,500
releasing of the solar panels is what I

764
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:43,259
call them the factories those solar

765
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,819
panels like they're gone and so once

766
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:46,679
they're gone it takes a week or two to

767
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:49,139
regenerate and to come back and so our

768
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:51,179
veg times turn into three to four weeks

769
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,799
rather than two

770
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:55,200
um and everybody who kind of wonders why

771
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:58,379
things are slow or why the diseases or

772
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,240
problems happen and and I'm just floored

773
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,919
at how many people plus and then when we

774
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,200
get into the nursery they're cutting off

775
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,840
all the money like the money is in the

776
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,880
branches and Bud sites and there is time

777
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,480
to cut that stuff off later if you go

778
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,100
into the nursery in veg and start

779
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,558
cleaning things up so to speak and

780
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:19,079
skirting and all this you've

781
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,119
cut away all kinds of money and if you

782
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:23,639
end up having the stretch go on you

783
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,379
yourself even more and there's plenty of

784
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,960
time to determine that in my opinion

785
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,419
sure cleaning some things up is is fine

786
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,980
and it's an okay thing to do but how

787
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:34,559
soon do you do it before you know you

788
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:37,319
have viable options and a lot of the

789
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:39,178
Growers are getting beat down by upper

790
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:40,918
management for hitting a certain grams

791
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,659
per square foot well are you going to

792
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,340
hit that number if you're in there

793
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,020
cleaning up all the time and

794
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:48,240
cutting things away and do you value

795
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:50,579
your job if it was me I wouldn't kill

796
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,759
any plants because of pests or pathogens

797
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:55,980
I wouldn't strip hardly off unless

798
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:57,720
I really knew that it was a something

799
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,640
that wasn't going to make anything yep

800
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,500
because you got to hit some numbers and

801
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,580
then if an upper management comes to you

802
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,038
later and you're hitting your numbers

803
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:06,898
and they're concerned about A to B ratio

804
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,339
that's another thing to look at but

805
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:10,500
right now everybody's concerned about

806
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:13,918
hitting these numbers and that's it so

807
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:16,079
if if that's what the case is then why

808
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,360
is the strip so important and you know

809
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,939
do we not realize the health of the

810
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:24,119
plant is compromised with the

811
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:26,100
cross-section of pathogen or viral

812
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:28,259
spread that goes on it's just like two

813
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:30,119
wrongs don't make it right well and I

814
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:33,619
think that that's

815
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:33,619
we have such a big information

816
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,580
Highway

817
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,558
and where the information comes from

818
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:42,418
if you're looking at a scientific paper

819
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,839
you always have to look at who paid for

820
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:48,659
the research right yeah well Instagram

821
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,379
and Linkedin and all these we never look

822
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:52,020
at

823
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,460
who's giving the message and why why is

824
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:55,558
that message coming from that person

825
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:58,860
who's behind the message but they're

826
00:31:55,558 --> 00:32:00,599
popular well exactly well

827
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:03,898
IPM

828
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:06,778
when you pay for xeritol or whatever

829
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:09,298
there's a there's money behind all these

830
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:13,079
things I'm not I'm not here to bad-mouth

831
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:15,000
products but there's a reason why some

832
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:18,019
of these things get used more and more

833
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,240
and more because there's there's a

834
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:24,418
conversation behind using it to control

835
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,058
something but the fact is a truly

836
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:30,538
healthy plan a plant that's functioning

837
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:32,278
at photosynthetic levels that are really

838
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:34,679
maximized

839
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:35,700
it can protect itself from a lot of

840
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,019
stuff

841
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,480
and

842
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:42,000
instead of focusing on making truly for

843
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,759
healthy and plants that can protect

844
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,798
themselves we focus on

845
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:48,000
products that we have to buy to apply to

846
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,398
the plant

847
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,240
to save it from the fact that it's not

848
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:58,319
healthy and it's being predated on by a

849
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:00,960
fungus or a parasite or a thyroid or an

850
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,759
actual pest aphids or yeah thrips or

851
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,319
something along those lines you know

852
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:06,000
well and then in the grow right now

853
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,278
everybody's trying to avoid these

854
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,159
post-harvest aspergillus fails so

855
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:13,500
they're going in and spraying things at

856
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:16,679
Harvest to avoid what might happen later

857
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,960
based in the trim room or the why do

858
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:20,940
they typically spray well when he

859
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,519
brought up xeritol that's a popular one

860
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,860
to spray the day of harvest I've seen

861
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,019
people spray the day before up until the

862
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:29,819
day of harvest where they're harvesting

863
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,259
plants and they're dripping wet with

864
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:33,418
zero tall as they're hanging them on

865
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:35,099
carts to go out and to be honest with

866
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:37,440
you like we talk and you're mentioning

867
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:39,178
all this you know effort money and hard

868
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,038
work that goes into these plants and the

869
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:43,019
compromising that occurs and we all hear

870
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,119
about that through drying and curing you

871
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:47,159
know hey you over dried your weeds so

872
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,259
you lose a lot of the Terps you know

873
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:51,240
that was like a rookie up back in

874
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:54,000
the day but now we're into this level of

875
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,599
okay risk management says to do this

876
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,519
with this really oxidizing type of uh of

877
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,439
a product and it's not that I'm against

878
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,359
zero tall and the makers of it and the

879
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,580
product but the process and where we've

880
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,859
gotten to to spray it on the day of

881
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:10,139
harvest it rips the Terps right it's the

882
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:12,299
terp burglar it's like the biggest say

883
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:14,579
bye to your Terps before you even dry it

884
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,099
like it doesn't matter the Terps are

885
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:18,719
gone and a lot of people are trying to

886
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:21,240
go by this new Edge education of

887
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,398
terpenes are cooler than THC and all

888
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,858
this other stuff but at the same time

889
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:27,598
the degradation from the time that they

890
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:29,598
cut those plants by some of these

891
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,760
practices of risk management for

892
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,980
post-harvest fails or whatever it is has

893
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,919
really you know like I mean it's another

894
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:40,559
damaging factor to Quality cannabis well

895
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:43,739
you know it's like when in my talk where

896
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:46,320
I said you know an ounce of an ounce of

897
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:48,479
prevention is worth a pound of cure so

898
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,679
when we're talking about aspergillus or

899
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,179
whether we're talking about heavy metal

900
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,760
uptake

901
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:56,398
figure out what your what is that Vector

902
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,760
how is how is that

903
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:02,219
aspect that's negating the quality of

904
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,560
your cannabis getting into your product

905
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:06,659
it doesn't just it doesn't just

906
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,619
magically appear the the Cannabis itself

907
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:10,559
didn't

908
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:12,660
magically make that it had it had to get

909
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,440
transported into there there's a vector

910
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:15,899
there

911
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,519
figure out the vectors invest the time

912
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,559
in figuring out how these things get

913
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,480
there and then focus on trying to

914
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:25,019
prevent that rather than trying to

915
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:28,019
always treat the the the symptom or the

916
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:29,460
yeah the illness fix the fix the cause

917
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:31,139
well that's almost like the health

918
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,880
industry you know what I mean it's like

919
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:35,819
here's all these products to Band-Aid

920
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,858
your cannabis to a harvest otherwise you

921
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,480
know don't worry about it you know we

922
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:41,219
got something for you where right

923
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,780
something like what we're doing here and

924
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:45,539
what you guys are up to is to help

925
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,700
prevent that to see ahead and to create

926
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:49,679
a healthy system that can fight these

927
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:52,980
things off naturally so that we use less

928
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:55,078
of those products just quickly my last

929
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,539
question before I let you guys go is

930
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,660
around you had mentioned different Cults

931
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:02,940
of ours and kind of what you notice and

932
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,259
what they uptake at different stages of

933
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,358
the plant is

934
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,820
all right so can you touch on some of

935
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,440
that what you notice from the sure

936
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,440
so

937
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,320
with sap analysis

938
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,358
um in our databases and just the history

939
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,460
of what we've been doing

940
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:23,880
the the Cannabis industry gives us the

941
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,920
most unique look at the plant

942
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,800
nutrient uptake

943
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,358
and particularly

944
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,640
controlled environmental agriculture in

945
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:33,719
cannabis is the one that has has opened

946
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:37,618
the door and given us the biggest

947
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:41,939
Epiphany moments the AHA moments because

948
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:44,700
the Cannabis industry with CI cea

949
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,800
has tried to grow multiple strains in

950
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:49,259
the same flower room

951
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,480
with the same feed with the same

952
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:54,180
environment so we have a lot of

953
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:58,199
controlled parameters but multiple

954
00:36:54,179 --> 00:37:00,419
strains so when we see this we can we

955
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,519
take a look and we say wait a minute

956
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:06,059
that Wedding Crasher

957
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:08,219
in the trop cookie and that Rose

958
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:10,259
under the same conditions with the same

959
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:12,239
feed are feeding totally different

960
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:15,900
they're taking up nutrients differently

961
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:17,879
so where this one is a heavy feeder crop

962
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,740
cookies a heavy heavy feeder it's taking

963
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,140
up a lot of phosphorus and look at early

964
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:24,899
on it takes up so much phosphorus that

965
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:27,420
it stretches it gets huge inner nose and

966
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,700
it'll be a six foot seven foot plant if

967
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,460
you don't hold back the Foss early

968
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:34,739
Wedding Crasher in that same room on

969
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,320
that same feed if you push it where the

970
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:40,858
chop cooking will take the 2-5 EC

971
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:43,440
Wedding Crasher will burn it cannot

972
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:46,078
handle that and it'll go way excessive

973
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,599
and it'll accumulate and burn

974
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,579
and then the rose it might be somewhere

975
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,200
in the middle but that controlled

976
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:56,039
environmental agriculture has given us

977
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:58,858
such a huge window into how varietal

978
00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:01,619
differences appear and and then you can

979
00:37:58,858 --> 00:38:03,838
take that same thing out to outdoor the

980
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:05,940
difficulty there being is that in a 40

981
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,039
acre field you might have a huge variety

982
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:10,559
of soil conditions across a Four Acre

983
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:12,179
field but you got to know that okay you

984
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,619
can't you can't feed it all the same

985
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:14,940
you've got to be aware that they're

986
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,740
going to feed differently across that

987
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,539
field and that's why everybody's so

988
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:19,919
screwed up a little bit I guess you

989
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:22,380
could say with trying to grow so many

990
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,900
cultivars in the same room to try to

991
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,420
keep the menu diverse to make the sales

992
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,338
people happy and all these other things

993
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,320
and so that's why I try to put it upon

994
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:33,599
these Farms to really try to figure that

995
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,338
out separate those things because what

996
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,680
we're trying to also create is the best

997
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:39,358
outcome like you can't create a great

998
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,659
outcome if you're doing all this

999
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:44,880
and especially not analyzing it and so

1000
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:47,460
how do you create the best outcome well

1001
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,680
obviously with the best healthiest moms

1002
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,079
you know the same strain in the same

1003
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,779
room so that you can feed it and and

1004
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,300
irrigate it to the best of its potential

1005
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,519
and you can't sit there and go oh well

1006
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,320
aphids Love The Wedding Crasher but they

1007
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,719
don't like the chop cookies yeah I mean

1008
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:06,000
it's like hello well yeah one doesn't

1009
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:08,098
take the nutrients is you know or isn't

1010
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,480
as healthy as the other yeah and they're

1011
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:13,260
they're feeding on the one that's the

1012
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:15,900
weak sister yeah exactly stop analysis

1013
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:19,560
can all and I I see this in crops I work

1014
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:22,920
with all crops is that sap analysis can

1015
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:26,099
show you which varieties you can grow

1016
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,740
together which varieties yeah yeah you

1017
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:31,260
can set up rooms with similar feeders

1018
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:33,358
yeah yeah yeah same with other crops

1019
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,040
um very similar so you're not doing 20

1020
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:37,078
different feeding regimes which is

1021
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,960
almost impossibly you can cut back on

1022
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:43,200
work you can cut back on man hours yeah

1023
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,960
yeah you need to grow similar varieties

1024
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:48,719
together at least understand

1025
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,000
the similarities I think that's so big

1026
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,919
like it's bigger than most people really

1027
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,780
realize and I think it's taken for

1028
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,180
granted especially by the grows clearly

1029
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,880
because that's all I see is too many in

1030
00:39:57,179 --> 00:40:01,500
one room it's like how can we calm that

1031
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,079
down a little bit so that we can create

1032
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,059
a better outcome like I mean God dang it

1033
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,859
I don't know how it's it's glaring in my

1034
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:10,019
eyes but they're the ones running the

1035
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:11,460
show so well I think you know and that

1036
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:13,679
can go all the way back to some of the

1037
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,358
engineering and the design some of the

1038
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,239
facilities were designed with flower

1039
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:19,920
rooms that are so large

1040
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:21,299
that you can't limit the number of

1041
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,980
strains in that room because it's hard

1042
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,720
there's nobody engineering yeah you

1043
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,059
don't have enough moms the nurseries

1044
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:29,879
don't hit that kind of numbers and so to

1045
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:31,380
your point is that taking that data

1046
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,358
aggregating it so that you can figure

1047
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,099
out which ones go best together most

1048
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,799
people just go oh this one harvests

1049
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,838
around the same time as yep that one so

1050
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,820
we put those together that's exactly it

1051
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,219
if you if you can figure out which ones

1052
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,680
feed similarly that's great but if this

1053
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:50,879
one if this one ripens at 60 five days

1054
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:53,519
and the other one ripens at at 75 days

1055
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,338
now you're you're still stuck

1056
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,079
because what happens is management says

1057
00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:59,880
look we got to find a we got you we're

1058
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,019
either gonna find the medium medium yeah

1059
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,599
and neither one of them is being

1060
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:05,519
harvested at its perfect spot yeah so

1061
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,039
we're instead of creating it instead of

1062
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,559
harvesting exceptional cannabis we're

1063
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:14,519
kind of making and you know we're making

1064
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:16,920
that mediocre yeah yep 100 right on but

1065
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:20,159
I think that's you know we we can take

1066
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,820
this to another level and I'm not saying

1067
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:25,500
you know I'm not saying use our sap data

1068
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,480
I'm not saying use this product don't

1069
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:30,539
use that product

1070
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,880
refine your policy your products get

1071
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:35,719
your program in place follow your Sops

1072
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,519
use data there's no reason for us to be

1073
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:40,679
cultivating in the dark it's the dark

1074
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:42,900
that we're in the Dark Ages we shouldn't

1075
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:44,960
be everywhere I go there's no reason to

1076
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:47,639
be in the dark yeah yeah that's awesome

1077
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,260
well thanks it's uh great being here at

1078
