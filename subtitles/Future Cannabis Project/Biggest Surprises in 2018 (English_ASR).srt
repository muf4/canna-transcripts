1
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:18,809
like just the the thing that surprised

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:22,859
me most was like very very calculated

3
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:25,710
moves in lawmaking that literally just

4
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,560
undercut the farmer undercut everybody

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,900
and and then pretty soon everybody just

6
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,969
started like you know going into fear

7
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:35,789
and backbiting and all this and

8
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,370
like it just like poof that's that's

9
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:40,259
crazy so anyway but but kudos to

10
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:41,789
everybody who's surviving and like you

11
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,579
know putting it in putting in all the

12
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:47,460
word yeah if you research the 1862

13
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,890
Homestead Act that was the methods for

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,620
removing the small subsistence farmer in

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,179
the way for big AG and so they're

16
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,009
following the same protocol to wipe out

17
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,859
the cannabis farmers now and they're

18
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:59,939
doing quick work of it and I think one

19
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,010
of the things that's really caught me

20
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,808
off-guard is like I knew at some point

21
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:06,390
there would be legal facilities and so I

22
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,769
just put all my focus into knowing the

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,239
knowledge that would be valuable at that

24
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:11,429
point I didn't really put my bandwidth

25
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:12,478
on much other you know and I some of

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,430
this other stuff really caught me off

27
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,929
guard and one of the things that really

28
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,540
caught me off guard was how quickly

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,970
we're diving to the bottom and that

30
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,368
really breaks my heart because not not

31
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,780
it's just it's so unnecessary it's like

32
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:26,310
right now you're you know you're going

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,379
some of these trim farms that are doing

34
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,930
acres and acres and acres of just

35
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,539
garbage and they're their business model

36
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,240
is literally to race it to the bottom

37
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,280
sustain people at the bottom and win out

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,839
at the lowest quality and just you know

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,269
the quality drop from last year to this

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,590
year has just been remarkable and you

41
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,048
know we're just trying to be a champion

42
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,850
for you know we can produce low quality

43
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,310
we can produce more we don't have to do

44
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:53,489
it in a low-quality fashion you know

45
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,829
there's big oil producers dank stuff I

46
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:58,949
mean when I was talking to Tim Blake

47
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:01,169
about oil you know for me on a oil

48
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,868
return they're doing it through a

49
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,840
hydrocarbon extraction and we like to

50
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:08,520
see you know eighteen percent and up and

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,670
so when I'm talking to Tim he's talking

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,040
about 17 percent listen

53
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:17,629
yeah well we and he goes no I mean hash

54
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:21,318
oh bubble hash at 17% returns that

55
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:23,180
would make some frickin oil I mean so

56
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:25,250
some of the genetics and some of the

57
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,810
things people have are stashed and ready

58
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,000
to go but some of those people don't

59
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:32,840
have licenses yet and that's the biggest

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,449
change for me to see in 2018 to now or

61
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,680
17 is just the remarkable amount of

62
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:39,019
people that we're there that aren't

63
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,439
there that are working their way in

64
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,689
it's a pay-to-play type of thing and

65
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:47,000
it's just definitely you got to stay on

66
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:49,689
your toes to be in it you can't it's not

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,449
coming for you you got to go after it

68
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:54,919
that's the biggest challenge you know

69
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:57,679
staying afloat with all the different

70
00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:00,799
changes and fluctuations that have to

71
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,390
keep we're not gonna stop no they're not

72
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,709
gonna stop and you know whether you're a

73
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:06,379
small farm or whether you're a large

74
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:08,479
farm adopting science-based principles

75
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:10,969
for your decision making is the way to

76
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,759
survive in the market as the profit is

77
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:15,709
dropping because we can't afford to have

78
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,409
catastrophic crop loss we need to do

79
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,969
pretty predictive testing to try to

80
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:21,709
assess what the tripping points are

81
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:23,689
gonna be and we need to mitigate those

82
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:25,759
risks so that we can still produce a

83
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:26,900
crop we can still be profitable and we

84
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,789
can have an opportunity to make it

85
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,140
through these next couple years you know

86
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:31,729
we're seeing a lot of pests it's like

87
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:34,339
another thing that's taking out farmers

88
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:36,649
is you know pests and disease from

89
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,420
different you know clone nurseries and

90
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,090
you know I had a you know one of my

91
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:42,559
hydroponic mentors he he lost six of the

92
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,239
first eight flowering rooms because the

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,489
clones he got from a nursery had viruses

94
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,959
in them and what really blows my mind is

95
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,480
that how long these products are being

96
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:54,019
pushed before it's being accepted and

97
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:56,090
dealt with and you know you know we just

98
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:58,519
recently had a situation where the grow

99
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,229
off passed out a couple clones with some

100
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,239
rude aphids and they immediately jumped

101
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:04,280
on that they immediately made a public

102
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,319
announcement Joe drew came out and

103
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,090
immediately owned up to it and tried to

104
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,489
make it right and you know of course the

105
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,900
Instagram gangs you know tried to mean

106
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:14,000
them off the planet of the earth which

107
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,590
is like the first response and you know

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,269
it's unfortunate that that's the view

109
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,060
that the community has of that type of

110
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:22,459
situation because you know my situation

111
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,079
I analyze these things and so I've been

112
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:25,668
hired by three nurseries and

113
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,728
last calendar year to deal with rude

114
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:31,128
aphids one of those farms sent out cuts

115
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:32,779
for four months with black and brown rue

116
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,460
de foods without owning up to it you

117
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:36,168
know and so it's like you know it's like

118
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:38,718
you finally get a license and you

119
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:40,250
finally get going and then someone with

120
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:41,810
a shitty conscience gives you some

121
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,728
horrible clones and you know it's like

122
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,769
we're seeing this across the board and

123
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:47,209
so it's like you know hats off to Joe

124
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:48,709
jury for be the only dude with balls

125
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:52,339
enough to own up to some like that

126
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:59,209
you know deal with it and the other

127
00:04:52,339 --> 00:05:00,978
thing would be you know well so I came

128
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:03,168
from the world of medicine I was a nurse

129
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:05,658
before I decided to do soil science and

130
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:07,818
in medicine you absolutely own up to

131
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:11,329
every problem immediately or people die

132
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:13,460
and so kudos to Jo Durie for stepping up

133
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:14,899
to the plate on that that is huge and it

134
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:16,399
sets the bar and the standard for

135
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:19,158
everybody the way it should be

136
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,929
there's no need to hide any mistakes you

137
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:26,759
absolutely own that that's the proper

138
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:28,959
way to do it so we appreciate you

139
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,670
yeah thanks mark around

140
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:46,479
future cannabis project comin atcha

141
