1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,258
with the clones and tissue culture you

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,450
have some phenomenal stuff and I not

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,160
even just stateside I think you're kind

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,509
of tapped in globally as far as landrace

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,969
and some of these other things when it

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,468
comes to true genetics right in projects

7
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:14,849
I am you know like I mean things stay

8
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:18,448
within the borders of the country but

9
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:20,850
for sure being being and being involved

10
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,010
in cannabis for a long time and sharing

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,890
genetics for a long time

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,689
I never really I never understood the

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,839
real impact of it over the course of

14
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,909
decades so I always moved material to

15
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,140
people and I was shared material people

16
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:35,699
because I believe fundamentally people

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,090
need good quality material to work with

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,340
and that and that being being generous

19
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,200
with that one aspect allows people to

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,840
have a much higher level of success and

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,399
I don't I never still don't I don't see

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,629
my fellow cultivators or nursery

23
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,969
operators really as competitors because

24
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:51,780
it's a big industry and and really what

25
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,250
you're is you're all in the same

26
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,259
situation working kind of

27
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,539
collaboratively so I've always moved the

28
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:02,070
material that way and what it did is it

29
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:04,409
allowed me to get a global amount of

30
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,868
people that I've dealt with over the

31
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,978
course of my life yeah so it lets me see

32
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:10,019
like what's going on in all these

33
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:15,569
different places it's nuts man last of

34
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:18,269
its pangs of Weeden in Iran Iran has got

35
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,429
fields of grass and so it's amazing to

36
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,079
see all of the Europe it's amazing to

37
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,330
see what's taking place all through the

38
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,938
Americas Australia New Zealand that

39
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:28,319
they've been hitting up and it's so to

40
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:29,609
me it's amazing because it lets us

41
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,739
really take a look at the picture of

42
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,179
genetics and then you know for us what

43
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:35,819
we did is we shift it into a full tissue

44
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,110
culture build-out so we tried to figure

45
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,019
out for years like how do you run an

46
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:41,219
operation using as the most I know what

47
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,219
I did is I look for whatever was the

48
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,349
stringent the most difficult standards

49
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,269
to try to follow with amount of inputs

50
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:51,839
so I would find out could you actually

51
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:54,420
succeed following a regulated system in

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,600
Ag because no other AG is regulated like

53
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,129
that and then it was hard and

54
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,408
and everybody's finding out how hard it

55
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:02,849
is right now because you don't have the

56
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,200
tools and so you can't suddenly have a

57
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:06,059
mistaken guard ever use the tool there's

58
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,310
no tool to use you're the problem and

59
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,020
it's it's it's difficult so we tried to

60
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,969
figure it out for years and we knew the

61
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,800
tissue culture was the only way to go

62
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:16,080
around it and I work with TC labs for a

63
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,790
while playing around but it just wasn't

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,130
dialed in enough to make it efficient

65
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:21,239
and so the price point was too high so

66
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:23,189
you could plug the cut but you couldn't

67
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,770
get the price point down so we were able

68
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:28,109
to work with the lab out of Petaluma

69
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,300
node and get it to the point where our

70
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,550
new facility is designed to just receive

71
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,500
the material from them in like in micro

72
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,330
plant look for them and then we just

73
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,039
grow it out into a clonal form so that

74
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,900
we can end wholesale it so it kind of

75
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,629
puts us in a job or level of a wholesale

76
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,430
so that it lets us put material into

77
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,310
nurseries or the nurseries that's been

78
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,140
virally stamped and third-party so this

79
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,030
way you you have the ability to start

80
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,068
with material that has been certified by

81
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,459
somebody other than us that's coming

82
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:59,189
from TC so it's not carrying any

83
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,680
inherent viruses any kind of pathogenic

84
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:04,709
problems that you lose areum is what you

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,819
see so much of and it's in the materials

86
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:07,409
in the material you're not gonna get rid

87
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,989
of it so scrubbing it gets rid of it

88
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:13,019
then it lets you grow and then work off

89
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,370
of getting your protocols straight so

90
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,659
then you can run the same variety a

91
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,700
couple times in a row and actually have

92
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:20,099
a predicate of concept what are you

93
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:22,048
gonna make no and without this

94
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,329
stabilization it's tough and so you see

95
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,409
in TC blow up everywhere but a lot of it

96
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,000
is they're just trying to figure it out

97
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:30,209
and we're ready to do the full rollout

98
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,219
right now so I'm excited because man

99
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,459
it's it's a nightmare to run nursery

100
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:37,259
operations in regulated conditions

101
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,810
because morally you don't want to use

102
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,798
any of this crap and then on a business

103
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,959
level you're not allowed to on

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,239
regulations and so far you have no tools

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,449
and cannabis is constantly being exposed

106
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,819
any pathogens all the time and so your

107
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:52,798
technology comes in and so strawberries

108
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,750
bananas fruit trees they all use this to

109
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,159
get around this problem and so that's

110
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,039
what we're gonna have to go with it and

111
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,959
in a lot of ways using the technology is

112
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,578
expensive but I would rather have the

113
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,609
tech and the expense and I would rather

114
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,989
have toxic anibus all right you know I

115
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:08,050
just don't agree with it man and I've

116
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,330
been I've been

117
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,770
a child people fears maybe people could

118
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,360
talk smack but come over in tests it's

119
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,420
never been any pesticides and fungicides

120
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,389
or regulators any of these plants ever

121
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:21,430
because that's an artificial reality and

122
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:22,689
and sometimes man you know you got to

123
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,329
look stupid to figure it out and

124
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:28,389
sometimes it's amazing how time changes

125
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:30,490
who looks bad who doesn't yeah but all

126
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,930
in all if we can do this correctly than

127
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,759
what it does it allows us to start

128
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,280
taking old varieties that are basically

129
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,800
they want to get rid of them and scrub

130
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:40,599
them on a cellular level and get the get

131
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,879
the pathogenic weight off of it

132
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,950
so that you can then have material

133
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,719
that's beautiful again and then hold it

134
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:49,240
in banks because so much of the source

135
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,310
material is being diminished because as

136
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,680
you remove the population of cultivators

137
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,569
that used to cultivate you can't afford

138
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,370
to hold a library if you can only sell

139
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:58,839
OG so why do you hold the other twenty

140
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,240
six varieties you're gonna get rid of

141
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,859
them and pretty soon you have nothing

142
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,030
and everyone goes here big guys I'll

143
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,650
have it no they don't when the big guys

144
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:08,649
come in when we call any of these large

145
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:11,889
lp's when they buy a grow company they

146
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:14,799
buy the company and they buy their there

147
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,360
their genetic collection and so it's the

148
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,250
genetic collection that seems to have

149
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,780
the value so I have an extensive genetic

150
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,750
collection that we laugh that goes back

151
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:25,089
in time right and I always laugh and I'm

152
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,800
just like it's the toolbox because I can

153
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:29,529
go into this collection and I can pull

154
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,850
out a lot of material and then it's

155
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,199
what's neat and I was some of the newer

156
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,810
collections because a lot of the newer

157
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,849
cannabis it's not that it's it's worse

158
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,980
or better than older cannabis it's just

159
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,840
marketed to different groups and so now

160
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,030
that you have a bigger demographic to

161
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:46,629
sell to because you can actually target

162
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:48,279
them we can start to have specific stuff

163
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:50,079
and for me you know I'm excited about

164
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,909
stuff that's meant for like 50 to 70

165
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,789
year olds that want to go back to like

166
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,260
just to smoke a good weed I love it

167
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,450
because you're already aware guys in the

168
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:00,099
industry besides that's like I have a

169
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:01,599
friend who's got a hundred thirty-five

170
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,710
acres down in Santa Barbara County and

171
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,670
I'm like if you want to do something

172
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:05,709
different it's like I'm trying to figure

173
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,600
out trying to chase all these trendy

174
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:09,459
strange I'm like I'll tell you one thing

175
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,939
to do now the largest group that's

176
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:15,539
consuming cannabis is 39 and under okay

177
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:17,879
but the fastest-growing segment is

178
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,170
is over 40 yeah so I said you know do

179
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,519
something different and I know you have

180
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,500
a lot of dispenser will say they won't

181
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,149
buy it they won't buy it but if you get

182
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,129
the marketing on point I'm like I'm

183
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:27,750
Tania get some of those strains get the

184
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:30,149
strain that you and I grew up it hit the

185
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:33,209
strain that your dad grew up and and and

186
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:35,039
and and make sure that you're letting

187
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,109
the individuals that you really want to

188
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,550
have experience that know it's there yes

189
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,319
so that's the problem because they're

190
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,460
not they're not looking at numbers they

191
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,199
don't care about numbers any care by

192
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:45,779
numbers in the past no they don't care

193
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,819
about Instagram what they what they care

194
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:54,199
about is I want smokes something that

195
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:57,300
makes me happy or calm or euphoric or

196
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,459
contemplative or relaxed but I want the

197
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,770
experience to be quality in any one of

198
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,359
those directions and a lot of the new

199
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:05,459
candidates because the potency levels

200
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,960
are so high they can't titrate it so

201
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,430
they can't get the dose right so they go

202
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,250
burn to join the two and they're just so

203
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,840
austere I'm worried about people who

204
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,430
maybe like this is why I stopped doing

205
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,079
the for any of my mom she was like I

206
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,120
don't like how it feels is this and that

207
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,589
I'm like mom that's like me I used to go

208
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,750
down to Mexico during spring break you

209
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:23,039
know kid growing up and I'm like that'd

210
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,810
be me going down there for spring break

211
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,939
getting drunk off tequila saying I'm

212
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,220
never drinking again exactly it's not

213
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:31,769
the right mentality when I think it's

214
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,420
BDS analytics have pointed out that the

215
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:35,759
potency of cannabis specifically as it

216
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:42,030
relates to THC has been a multiplier

217
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:43,230
it's been 4x in the last 7 years needs

218
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,969
it though because if you're not pulling

219
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:48,480
over 20 you know you're not making any

220
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:50,550
money on the extract is you have to yeah

221
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,170
and so it's just really trying to

222
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,210
stratify if we goes like nobody smokes

223
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,770
flour anymore but it is market across

224
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:57,299
the board for everything oh yeah it's

225
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:59,789
just you have to target it correctly and

226
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,759
there are people that smoke flour a lot

227
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,680
of them want experience over sheer

228
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,209
knockout and that's where you can get

229
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,759
into the extracts because we can make

230
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:12,569
anything stronger and then add a trip

231
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,980
package to direct it but for the the

232
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:16,050
people that want to be able to consume

233
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,670
cannabis in an enjoyable manner where

234
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,139
they can burn five six joints and hang

235
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,910
out and laugh and now that we know that

236
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,979
the lung ailments don't exist with

237
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:26,520
cannabis really so this way someone says

238
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,919
smoking weeds bad for you I got you know

239
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,709
my lungs pretty good

240
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,179
and so that that allows you to really

241
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:35,958
get rid of that argument and go back

242
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,458
into this is how I prefer to smoke and

243
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,978
what I want is I want cannabis it makes

244
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,829
me feel good in the direction I want and

245
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,980
I don't need a celebrity endorser on it

246
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,450
I don't need a special box on it I used

247
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,320
to get it in a baggie out the back of a

248
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:55,770
car from a dude named Shiloh ya know we

249
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,149
can and it's all good so that's really

250
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,028
what the truth of it is is and then just

251
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:02,399
give it to him in a in a clean form safe

252
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:04,350
form reliable form and then have it so

253
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,419
they can go get it through the course of

254
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,830
the year I'll make a pre buy or be able

255
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:09,870
to get because people would buy a couple

256
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,420
ounces or you couldn't get them in one

257
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,879
shot but you could buy a quarter pound

258
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:17,189
over a week put it in your house throw

259
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,230
up throw a liter pack in it they'll keep

260
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:23,100
it moist and you have yourself some rich

261
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:28,440
cannabis for a long time so you know

262
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,670
that group would do that I mean we were

263
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,440
just we did a little field trip down to

264
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,899
mercy lovely guys down the road yeah

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,550
great products weren't cute and the guy

266
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,839
in front of me is like all I know is I

267
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,849
found the one I like and I keep coming

268
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,260
back say have it yeah and I'm like and

269
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,370
do you know which farm it not just a

270
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,360
strain do you know which farm are

271
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,009
getting it from you so I do I'm oh

272
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,019
that's what matters yep yeah there's a

273
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:49,439
genotype there's a phenotype it's in a

274
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:52,078
production in a production type yeah so

275
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,279
the same varietal in the hands of two

276
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:55,289
different people's radically different

277
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,169
animal yeah and so when you find a good

278
00:09:55,289 --> 00:10:00,000
farm reward the farmer buy rebuy his

279
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:02,578
product and then you'd also contact the

280
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,200
farm and ask them what else do you do

281
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:06,299
that's like this and who else might I

282
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,490
want a smoked weed from yeah because we

283
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:10,229
always advertise each other now it's so

284
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,120
like competitive but it doesn't need to

285
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,850
be what needs to be competitive is

286
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,919
getting the education to the public so

287
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,019
that they have enough tools to make

288
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,299
smart decisions so that they're

289
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:24,419
satisfied with what they buy and they

290
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:26,849
rebuy it and you got it you got to be of

291
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:29,370
service to these people that they they

292
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:32,339
do not know and they haven't been

293
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,580
exposed and in the dispensary is shield

294
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:36,980
the truth in a lot of cases

295
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,450
and the grower needs to be able to make

296
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,370
these direct connections and when people

297
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,620
find that they love a flower from a farm

298
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,029
and they can contact the farm and have a

299
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,649
communication of in and it may not be

300
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:47,120
able to sell to him directly but they

301
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:49,519
can sure as hell help them understand

302
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,590
why they are who they are which then

303
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,419
lets word-of-mouth Drive your business

304
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,220
and they can also say these are other

305
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,259
farms that have nice products you should

306
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,639
check them out because that's what

307
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:00,679
you're doing is now you being a cannabis

308
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,080
human being that's true and that's yeah

309
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,569
again we we were just having dinner last

310
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,820
night downtown here in Santa Rosa and

311
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,830
there were I would venture to say there

312
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,480
were some growers sitting at the table

313
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,340
next to us that's one of them brought

314
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,810
that up they're like screw it I want to

315
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,129
go straight to the dispensary I want to

316
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:17,239
be able to tell my story I want to be

317
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:18,500
able to share what makes this different

318
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,000
I thought was really interesting how

319
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,740
that exactly your point they're like if

320
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,240
we could cut out the distributor we

321
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,799
would and you know they want to

322
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,570
communicate we want to do it what we'll

323
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,849
do with those though at the dispensary I

324
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,670
have the one log we'll set it up to

325
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,529
where we have the grower events where we

326
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:35,449
can get all the growers that want to

327
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:37,009
come down from the hills and meet the

328
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,790
public that we can advertise for bring

329
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,399
them because we have a beautiful

330
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:41,719
facility to do his that and then we can

331
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,870
then sell their product through the

332
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,080
store legally for them but we don't have

333
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,810
to be the person that interprets who you

334
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,310
are and then explains it to another you

335
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:53,929
can do that directly and then they can

336
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:56,209
confer with us so we can we can

337
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:56,750
substantiate via that yeah they are

338
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,670
those people

339
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,870
they said they do a really good job and

340
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:01,819
you're like they do they do a great job

341
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,250
and what it does now you have

342
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,930
confirmation of a hypothesis a belief

343
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,059
that you've confirmed becomes a purchase

344
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:13,789
and if it's good they buy a toy so

345
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:15,199
unless you buy it twice it's on stuff

346
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:16,819
checked out the dispensary up there with

347
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,050
you guys that's why I suppressed by

348
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,370
because you're right you go into some of

349
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:22,969
these especially the higher bar I'm not

350
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:24,740
knock you know business to business in

351
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,090
the disconnect and I know we're trying

352
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,980
to be more PC we're starting to call

353
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:31,340
them cannabis consultants versus bud

354
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,250
tenders but a lot of its office a new

355
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,560
term it's a cannabis that's hella funny

356
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,659
C squared C squared

357
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,459
cannabis consultants is like somewhere

358
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:42,049
we segue from rec to adult use of

359
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,089
terminology yeah

360
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:48,859
for a tional use yes inspirational use

361
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:50,750
I'm not a secret shop but not to claim

362
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,159
went out just to experience it and this

363
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,539
young lady I'm like well you know what's

364
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,610
your favorite psyche well I was just

365
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:58,759
lazy not at lunch and I just ripped that

366
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,778
and I'm like she was full on high when

367
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:01,669
she is talking to me make a

368
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:03,769
recommendation she is recommending based

369
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:05,809
on someone who their idea of hitting the

370
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:07,940
pinnacle is true noble yes for what her

371
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:11,000
favorite terpene was she'd be like yeah

372
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,130
it doesn't matter where and it the the

373
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,049
farmer the farmer needs to be able to

374
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:16,399
get in there because ultimately there is

375
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:17,870
well there's a lot of weight the

376
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,940
cannabis consultant names killing me

377
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,459
there's a lot of weight I always I'm

378
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,570
always aggressive on the budtender

379
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,699
but it's not because I have any

380
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,410
disrespect for them it's the opposite

381
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,300
it's that they're having a lot of

382
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:32,449
responsibility put on their back very

383
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:35,059
true for not a lot of money and the the

384
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,589
education just needs to be put in place

385
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:39,739
so that they're understanding more on

386
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:43,850
how to market and satisfy the desire of

387
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:46,310
the farm and the buyer that either user

388
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,600
and it's a lot of weight on them and so

389
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:50,049
they always get a ration ship and not

390
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,940
being educated enough but I'm like if it

391
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:55,009
was a tree like a career do that oh yeah

392
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,690
no that's a--that's like a real barista

393
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:57,500
in Italy yes yeah that's a different job

394
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,440
go to Italy

395
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,509
they're not regular coffee baker you get

396
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,130
their passion yeah everything conductors

397
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,679
they can they conduct a business man

398
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:08,120
they run a tight ship and I saw that

399
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,649
when we were really quick that's there

400
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,870
was a gal she is kneeling there doing a

401
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,370
fender day at a jetty and packs air

402
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,980
which was nice there was an older woman

403
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,078
I'd venture to guess about 68 69 sitting

404
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,670
on the couch and you had cannabis

405
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,379
consult and I was talking to her and I

406
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:22,519
was eavesdropping because being in the

407
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:24,350
industry law I just want to hear

408
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,850
people's story that's it the way that

409
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,070
this woman was explaining it and

410
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,480
speaking at her level it's almost like

411
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,250
okay obviously she went to college and

412
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,839
took speech one day right yet she knew

413
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,610
her audience she knew how to speak to

414
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:36,770
this woman and she is being very

415
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,379
specific on the dosage and before you go

416
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:41,208
to bed one puff see how if you wake up

417
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:43,338
with obviously sleep deprivation what

418
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:45,198
yes 64% of people who consume cannabis

419
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:47,180
according to BDS is because of sleep

420
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,009
issues yeah this woman was born about if

421
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:50,389
you wake up 3 4 in the morning one more

422
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:52,610
puff that should carry you through I

423
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,250
love the fact that she she has taken the

424
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,050
time

425
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,899
I mean there's there is a cute this was

426
00:14:55,049 --> 00:15:00,000
Friday 50 people in line this was all

427
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:02,100
about the dance and that kind of stuff

428
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,269
you can't fake like everybody has these

429
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,250
policies where we do all these things

430
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:08,250
but really the people that serve

431
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,039
cannabis the tenders when they're when

432
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:13,980
they're real they they're so crucial

433
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,958
because they interface all these people

434
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,389
that are undereducated and how to use

435
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,679
the product and then they alleviate

436
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:22,230
their fear that they're gonna make a

437
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,508
mistake and so they give them confidence

438
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,159
to try things and they they give them

439
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:28,289
information and they can direct them and

440
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,458
steer them and it's a beautiful

441
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:30,599
relationship and I mean at first

442
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,638
somebody's been running dispensaries for

443
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,740
a long time but senders get their own

444
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,970
it's almost like bartenders oh yeah our

445
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,810
cannabis consultants are you illiquid

446
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:42,149
consulted the liquor consultant gets a

447
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:44,458
unbelievable following because of how

448
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,078
they serve that drink to the person and

449
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:48,299
make them feel that it's worth their

450
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,578
time to be there in the interaction yeah

451
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:52,799
yeah yeah no it's it's it's it's it's a

452
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:55,229
pure yeah and with with cannabis its

453
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,969
brand new in that respect and you've got

454
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,589
to be able to put it together and then

455
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,959
you have to be able to have tenders that

456
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:02,639
understand what the products are and

457
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,649
then you have to have the ability that

458
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,860
farms have reps that are human and

459
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:10,470
patient that are able to say listen take

460
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,389
the time and you repeat yourself a lot

461
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,250
because each person is going to ask the

462
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:16,589
same questions but bottom line is that's

463
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,149
your responsibility yeah and when you

464
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:19,769
really look at it like that it allows

465
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,240
you to really get lost in what you're

466
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:23,549
doing and then people who listen to it

467
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,110
the people who listen to you explain to

468
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,698
someone else are the ones that really

469
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,250
are affected because they go you know

470
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:32,068
what just like you saw that girl or that

471
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,808
woman serve that other woman you will

472
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:35,759
always look at the woman who did the

473
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:37,889
serving differently because you realize

474
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,720
not only were you effective with your

475
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:40,399
speech but you were effective as a human

476
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,980
being

477
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,769
that you took the time to slow down and

478
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:49,310
help someone who was unaware of how to

479
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:50,509
use the tools and it wasn't to push up

480
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,219
cell you weren't trying to sell him a

481
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,740
product you were just trying to get him

482
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,480
something that worked and and the effort

483
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,149
was there and you know that's why I

484
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,778
located me so bad so it's the cool

485
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:03,838
[Music]

486
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:03,838
