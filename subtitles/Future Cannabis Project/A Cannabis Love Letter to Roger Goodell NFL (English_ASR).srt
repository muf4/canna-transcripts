1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,979
I wrote a letter to Roger Dale just

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,750
stating that as I'm like I said I'm a

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,009
nerd so I had to learn stuff so once I

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,839
started learning and going through all

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:11,218
these information I had some time

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,048
members that are going through

7
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:16,320
chemotherapy and I noticed the huge

8
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:17,460
benefits of cannabis with chemotherapy

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,589
and cancer patients and help them

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,118
relieve pain like Vic and relieve pain

11
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:23,399
for cancer they can relieve pain for my

12
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,629
guys coming off of an ACL injury because

13
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,739
I'm the pain

14
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:26,969
it makes you apprehensive when you

15
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:28,259
apprehensive you play slower when you

16
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:29,849
play slower you're more susceptible get

17
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,380
another injury so they want you to play

18
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,429
fast at high level without thinking so

19
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,509
in order to do that you have to

20
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:37,979
disregard your body pain receptors so I

21
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:39,269
put all that in the letter sticking to

22
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,039
roger goodell this is the things that we

23
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,379
preach in the locker room you know play

24
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,280
fast play hard play smart you can't do

25
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:45,359
that when you're contracting on your

26
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,160
injuries and then when you're taking all

27
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,359
these other drugs makes you the Thar

28
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,319
Jake it makes you dull sluggish moody

29
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,519
last thing you want is the quarterback

30
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,659
to be pissed off at you and moody and

31
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,489
then you know I get in the ball you say

32
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:57,659
something to him that he doesn't like in

33
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:58,979
the locker room and you go on the field

34
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,089
and now he's not throwing the ball to

35
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,349
you and you wonder why so cuz he's

36
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,640
pissed at you why he's pissy I don't

37
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,820
know his hormones are off because taking

38
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,049
all these damn pain meds so I'm talking

39
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:08,609
about your Dell and saying that you know

40
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,130
there's a huge issue with this a lot of

41
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:12,659
the players are looking to fight these

42
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:14,489
pain problems they have a lot of the

43
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,689
alumni are suing the NFL because of all

44
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:17,009
the payments they took and all the

45
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:18,868
steroid injections you give them a

46
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,129
cortisone shots to their knees then just

47
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:21,959
cause their needs to go out if you look

48
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:23,969
at the older players there they walk

49
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,469
like the Frankenstein and then it's sad

50
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:28,319
to see that they didn't have the same

51
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,789
type of opportunities that we do now as

52
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,399
far as they do is the medical science

53
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,890
involved with cannabis and I think that

54
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,689
CVD is gonna be the lifesaver of the NFL

55
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,890
when they start implementing and they

56
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:40,379
did take it off the bench Tufts of this

57
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,909
announced so CVD is off the banned

58
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:43,589
substance NFL so they're able to take

59
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,990
CBD but it has to be I think hemp

60
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,340
derived a leaf not mistaken so but the

61
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:49,559
THC levels are still something that they

62
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,450
monitor and NFL and I think that once

63
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,890
they learned that it's less of a

64
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,200
headache if you allow them to smoke weed

65
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,090
then if you take that away from them and

66
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,189
they resort to other ways of caring the

67
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,560
pain because I know there's a lot of

68
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:03,118
athletes that give TRO for DUIs because

69
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,409
it's legal to drink and when your body

70
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:04,920
hurts you're just gonna drink a lot to

71
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,659
dull the pain

72
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,739
but then that alcohol stays in your

73
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,439
system the next day and the day after

74
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,848
that now your brain is catching up and

75
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,289
then your body's still catching up and

76
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:13,799
then you're going into another week of

77
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:15,509
pain

78
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,040
bringing the baggage from the week

79
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:20,129
before so I think that once they learn

80
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:23,310
that cannabis is the solution as far as

81
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:25,530
helping your body it's just it's as

82
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,909
better overall and Roger Goodell didn't

83
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,469
respond to me so I keep harassing them

84
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:30,030
every time so every time every chance I

85
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:31,919
get Peter asked me to come and speak

86
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,840
about this does they put me on camera

87
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,009
I mention it because it's something that

88
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,270
we got to put pressure on them to see

89
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:38,069
that there's people there advocating for

90
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,110
it now because we're potheads that's

91
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:41,519
what their favorite go-to is oh we were

92
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,180
pot hits most like when Trump's like oh

93
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,710
it's a witch-hunt

94
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,330
now let's just get down to what it

95
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,770
really is you know it's something that's

96
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,910
going to help everybody as a whole so

97
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,590
let's start learning about it talking

98
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,090
about it being more open about it so

99
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,740
that we can get the people that need it

100
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,520
the best help they can they can get this

101
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,520
out there on the market
