1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,040
uh this is kevin mckernan and i'm um

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,480
i'm obsessed with genomics and lately

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,359
it's been cannabis genomics at least

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:16,320
since uh

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:17,920
probably nine years now since 2011.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,439
hey everybody this is jason wilson with

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,760
the curious about cannabis podcast

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,480
thanks so much for tuning in once again

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,480
uh today

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,599
so today i'm really really stoked to

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,679
have on a guest i've

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,039
been sort of casually following for

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,640
years and i've been

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,320
wanting to connect with for a long time

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,079
i'm with kevin mckernan with medicinal

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
genomics thanks so much kevin for

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,439
being willing to come on the podcast

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,719
thanks for having me jason i've uh

19
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,320
really enjoyed all the guests you've had

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,000
so far so it's been a it's a great

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,520
podcast to get going oh thank you so

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,238
much i appreciate that and i look

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,079
forward to

24
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,078
having you right in there with everyone

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,878
else that i've been speaking with and

26
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,399
um today we're going to talk about um a

27
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,599
topic that i haven't touched in any

28
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,000
other interview

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,719
primarily because it gets into an area

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,600
where

31
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,679
there aren't a ton of people doing this

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,000
work but we're going to talk about

33
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,159
cannabis genetics and genomics and

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
microbiology primarily

35
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,320
um and so kevin for those listeners that

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,079
maybe are not familiar with you and your

37
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,798
work can you briefly describe some of

38
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,719
your

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,479
academic and professional background

40
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,640
leading up into

41
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,159
your founding of medicinal genomics and

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,040
the work that you're doing there

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,159
oh sure so i started off my genomics

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,960
career at

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,640
the whitehead institute back at mit so

46
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,078
this is a center in cambridge that was

47
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,960
sequencing the human genome

48
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,919
and was part of an international effort

49
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,759
to sequence

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,960
the human genome along with the saenger

51
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,599
center and a few folks

52
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,399
uh in in japan and europe uh that was uh

53
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,919
from 96 to 2000 and i was managing their

54
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,599
research and development team there

55
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
so we built a lot of the robotics that

56
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,599
um that

57
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
automated the dna purification and and

58
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,039
got the

59
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,718
sequencing running there and in 2000 uh

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,600
when that project was coming to a close

61
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,599
i decided to

62
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,519
spin out a few of the patents that we

63
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,919
had acquired at the time there

64
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,078
into a company called agincourt and this

65
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
was a dna sequencing a private entity

66
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,280
that was a dna sequencing provider for a

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,439
lot of people in the in the

68
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,719
pharmaceutical and healthcare space but

69
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,439
we also sold

70
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:18,000
dna purification tools that help people

71
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:21,359
extract dna out of cells

72
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,919
and fast forward to 2011

73
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,680
um seven years in that in that time

74
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,839
frame the company also built a

75
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,000
dna sequencer known as a solid sequencer

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,239
that eventually went to market under

77
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,280
um under applied biosystems they were

78
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,039
the

79
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,719
those in the sequencing field they

80
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,439
probably know of maybe two companies

81
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,039
that have had

82
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,120
fairly large market shares throughout

83
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,878
the history of dna sequencing and abi

84
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,878
was the first one they had all these

85
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,639
sanger sequencers and and uh

86
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,000
they have um they're still in the market

87
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,039
and they still do their thing under the

88
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,199
thermo name

89
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,318
but there's uh now illumina who's a very

90
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,280
large contender and are

91
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,719
arguably um a larger entity now and we

92
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,560
were competing with illumina

93
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,840
with a solid sequencer for a period of

94
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,800
about five years

95
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,080
um and then in around 2011 i decided to

96
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,840
just do something different and

97
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,440
get out of the industry and go and go

98
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,598
into the plant genetic space and we

99
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,079
began sequencing cannabis genomes back

100
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,959
in 2011.

101
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,159
flew over to amsterdam and extracted a

102
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,158
bunch of samples over there

103
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,759
met don and aaron from dna genetics and

104
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,120
dave watson and a bunch of other

105
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,199
robert clark a bunch of other folks

106
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,719
showed me around over there

107
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,560
and we really didn't know what to do

108
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,639
with it at the time we just knew that

109
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,400
genomics helped so many other markets it

110
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,000
was bound to help this one but we had no

111
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,760
idea what to do with the information and

112
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
how to turn it into a company

113
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,479
um so we kind of explored a little bit

114
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,158
um and uh i'd say it was a very slow

115
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,759
start with medicinal genomics because we

116
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,679
were a company that was embedded inside

117
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,120
of a clinical diagnostic company known

118
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,760
as cordogen

119
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,360
and most of the company's efforts were

120
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,000
sequencing kids with epilepsy and

121
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,840
mitochondrial disease and arguably

122
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,438
a lot of diseases that center around the

123
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,039
ecs uh

124
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,479
although the people in the clinical

125
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,000
sequencing space probably don't know

126
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,639
what the ecs is yet

127
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,919
um they're as you've probably heard from

128
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,399
many of the guests you've had before

129
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,158
it's not really taught in medical school

130
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,519
so that was an interesting business but

131
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,359
a very challenging one because as

132
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,480
insurance companies moved into the space

133
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,159
after the ama

134
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,159
they didn't like this idea of sequencing

135
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,000
for uh idiosyncratic diseases

136
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,519
um diseases we don't really understand

137
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,600
you don't want to reimburse for that

138
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,120
so they started raising people's

139
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,639
deductibles and making that type of

140
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,680
sequencing very difficult for people to

141
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,040
do

142
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,439
and that's when we decided to shift the

143
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
company fully into sequencing cannabis

144
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,199
genomes because we saw

145
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,720
ironically less headwinds regulatory

146
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,960
headwinds in the cannabis space than in

147
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,800
the clinical sequencing space

148
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,120
so if that gives you any sense of

149
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,879
background i've wandered from research

150
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,639
sequencing to clinical sequencing all

151
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,560
the way into what people might call

152
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,800
recreational sequencing

153
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,399
but always has dna in the thread and

154
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,879
what is it about

155
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,519
working with genetics and studying dna

156
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,600
that

157
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,478
that really draws you in that you that

158
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,600
you find really interesting

159
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,599
well personally i like the fact that it

160
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,560
reveals how different everybody really

161
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,879
is

162
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,079
i mean we have this societal tendency to

163
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,680
want to group people

164
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:14,959
into uh into either races or

165
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,720
or sexes or or these other large

166
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,000
categories and treat the entire

167
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,520
population as one

168
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,959
and what we're learning from the human

169
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,478
genome projects that is incredibly

170
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,000
stupid

171
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,159
everybody's very very different and

172
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,759
unique and personalized medicine is

173
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,479
clearly the way to go

174
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,479
uh and it's just taking time um to sort

175
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,000
of fight the system to make the system

176
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,519
aware of the fact that you're not going

177
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,959
to have an algorithm to apply to a

178
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,279
population you're going to need to have

179
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,239
physicians actually speak to patients

180
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,879
uh and ascertain that individual's needs

181
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,000
um

182
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,319
so that i don't know that that has

183
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,240
always been uh appealing to me as i i

184
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,199
generally don't like one-size-fits-all

185
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,478
principles

186
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,160
they're just grotesque and um uh and

187
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,079
there's a tremendous amount of potential

188
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,639
in sequencing people's genomes and

189
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,959
improving

190
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,199
improving healthcare uh now that that

191
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,719
same story really resonates in cannabis

192
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,240
because you get involved in

193
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,319
cannabis genomes and you realize they're

194
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,840
even more different than people are yeah

195
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,039
yeah and this concept of a sativa or a

196
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,679
hybrid or an indica

197
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,800
is is garbage yes i'm glad to hear you

198
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,360
say that

199
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,520
and so we have to change that if we

200
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,919
particularly if we want the medical

201
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,240
system to start to speak this language

202
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,680
um they're not going to prescribe green

203
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,840
crack to somebody

204
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,840
you know it's it's they're going to want

205
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,758
to know terpene profiles maybe even a

206
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,119
genotype because there's a lot of dark

207
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,400
pharmacology as you heard

208
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,600
um spoken about before uh the the

209
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,439
chemotypes are great

210
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,439
but they only measure maybe a dozen

211
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,319
compounds and we know there's thousands

212
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,800
uh and so the genomics is another cheap

213
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,520
way of getting at that information

214
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,120
and i think the other thing that's

215
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,120
really exciting about the genomics field

216
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,879
is there probably isn't a field out

217
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,639
there that's moving at a faster pace

218
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,719
um when when you start looking at the

219
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,319
cost declines in dna sequencing

220
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,639
we've never seen anything like this

221
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,160
before and any even in the even in the

222
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,680
chip market where you hear about

223
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,280
moore's law and and moore's law is slow

224
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,800
it's actually something that kind of

225
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,638
gets laughed at in the sequencing space

226
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,560
because we're always held back by the

227
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,720
fact that the chips aren't fast enough

228
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,319
yeah and the sequencers are moving at a

229
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,240
faster pace than uh

230
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,319
than the semiconductor improvements are

231
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,079
so it's a um

232
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,520
it's one of those fields that forces you

233
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,478
to learn about

234
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,318
um dna storage and you know data storage

235
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,839
information whether that be in dna or

236
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,120
not in dna storage

237
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,478
you have to learn about hard drives you

238
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,439
have to learn about internet bandwidth

239
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:34,959
you have to learn about

240
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,560
chemistry required to sequence these

241
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,038
things so it's very

242
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,240
um you can't get bored in this space

243
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,360
yeah yeah

244
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,598
man there's several things you've

245
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,919
touched on that like spark

246
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,519
passions inside of me as well i mean one

247
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:48,159
um like i mentioned before we started

248
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,680
the interview

249
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,319
part of my background is in i.t and

250
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,759
even in um you know chemistry labs that

251
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,520
i've worked in a lot of times i end up

252
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,960
becoming the technologist because i'm

253
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,198
very interested in the

254
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,638
equipment as well and and the idea of

255
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,160
information and so

256
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,879
one thing about genetics that interests

257
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,759
me but i'm so

258
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,599
deficient in my like formal training

259
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,879
with genetics but just the idea of how

260
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,199
information is

261
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,319
stored transmitted you know in these

262
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,319
ways that are not necessarily intuitive

263
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,360
but then also what you just touched on

264
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,800
is something that

265
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,120
several clinicians that i've interviewed

266
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
have talked about is this move towards

267
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,319
what's sometimes called in of one

268
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,360
medicine or

269
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,360
um yeah individualized medicine trying

270
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,158
to figure out how to use that genetic

271
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,200
data

272
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,278
to understand what a patient is sort of

273
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,680
bringing to the table

274
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,799
before going in to prescribe certain

275
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,399
treatments and everything so that you

276
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,039
can narrow down

277
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,519
um with much more confidence what might

278
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,039
be more likely to work

279
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,879
yeah and i think it's really important

280
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,719
we learned this in the epilepsy field

281
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,000
that um

282
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,160
sequencing and understanding the

283
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,080
patient's genome can can can save lives

284
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,000
i mean there are certain mutations

285
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,920
in um in epilepsy that just require

286
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,039
vitamin supplementation and the seizures

287
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,159
go away

288
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,000
and that can often get in the way um

289
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,439
you might put them in cbd and not notice

290
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,120
that for six months and

291
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,399
then they end up honeymooning out of it

292
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,399
and it really turns out they just

293
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,879
actually needed vitamin b6 or b12

294
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,720
or folic acid or they need to be in a

295
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,639
ketogenic diet because they have glucose

296
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,160
transported mutations there's a host of

297
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,679
there's at least like 24 different forms

298
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,600
of genetic epilepsy

299
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,519
that are actionable based on the genome

300
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,440
itself and they may not always lead you

301
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,919
into benzos or cannabinoids they might

302
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,560
leak the path that doesn't even involve

303
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,439
these

304
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,559
these compounds so um we think it's very

305
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,839
very valuable

306
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,278
the the challenge is um cannabinoids

307
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,240
right now sit in this really weird legal

308
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,759
conundrum where

309
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,759
it's difficult for doctors to prescribe

310
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,679
them it's even more difficult for you to

311
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,360
have a genetic test that actually tries

312
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,120
to look at the variants

313
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,800
and make informed decisions on which

314
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,919
cannabinoids to potentially use or if to

315
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,000
use them at all

316
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,479
because there's a lot of there's a lot

317
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,440
of fda scrutiny on direct to consumer

318
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,000
genetics right

319
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,800
there shouldn't be but there is um they

320
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,360
don't like

321
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,120
having patients enabled to make

322
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,480
intelligent decisions they want that all

323
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,519
to be channeled through

324
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,920
the fda appointed medical school doctors

325
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,039
and that doesn't scale um it's important

326
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,319
that physicians obviously

327
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,480
are very well trained and know what

328
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,399
they're doing but um the the better

329
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,399
thing is to make sure all the patients

330
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,078
uh begin to pay very close attention to

331
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,919
their health because there's no one who

332
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,359
is more vested in the outcome of their

333
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,879
health and the individual

334
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,560
and arming them with information in my

335
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,200
mind is always a good thing but

336
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,399
um they don't see it that way yet and uh

337
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,920
so they have been

338
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,000
cracking down a lot of companies that do

339
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,838
direct to consumer genetics if they ever

340
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
imply that they're going to be used for

341
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,600
medical decisions and 23andme was one

342
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,320
case of this where they just got

343
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,680
um they got hammered by the fda and they

344
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
kind of sent a signal through through

345
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,159
the uh

346
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,320
through the field that if you do any of

347
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,919
this without going to the fta we're

348
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,320
gonna come down on you so

349
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,159
um we we for a while we're but we're

350
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,519
looking at panels that would genotype

351
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,439
patients and try to discern you know

352
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,799
whether they had like an mthr

353
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,560
mutation and they should go one

354
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,879
direction or whether they had variants

355
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,479
that might predispose them to opiate

356
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,240
addiction because there are some known

357
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,920
that increase your likelihood of opioid

358
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,278
addiction and that might be

359
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,360
that might coach you in the direction of

360
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,639
cannabinoids but um

361
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,879
i think the sequencing needs to get a

362
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,319
lot cheaper for that to happen because

363
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,919
right now it's probably

364
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,040
a couple hundred dollars is prob might

365
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,719
be better spent going to through

366
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,199
dispensary and just experimenting with

367
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,920
different

368
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,360
cbd and thc ratios until you find

369
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,159
something that actually works because

370
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,680
the

371
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,399
science we have around the genotypes is

372
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,439
still um is i would say it's fuzzy but

373
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,958
still it's early

374
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,560
it's very early correlating these

375
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,879
genotypes to

376
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,239
to outcomes well that's that's exactly

377
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,240
what i um

378
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,519
where my mind was going next i know that

379
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,600
one of the

380
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,440
limitations currently with some of the

381
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,040
genomic research on humans is just

382
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,600
trying to understand

383
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,958
how to interpret the data that's there

384
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,320
and how to correlate it

385
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,838
to um you know very specific things and

386
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,440
something that i think we'll get into in

387
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,320
a little bit when we talk about cannabis

388
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,920
is that genetics can be very tricky in

389
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,560
that you can think you have the full

390
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,679
picture

391
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,239
of what genes

392
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,838
and you know what correlating enzymes

393
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,278
and things are responsible for

394
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,480
trickling out into certain effects and

395
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,078
then you realize the picture is more

396
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,519
complicated

397
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,679
than you initially thought and there's

398
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,759
more involved more genes or

399
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,599
um or even novel mechanisms that you

400
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,439
weren't even aware of

401
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,200
it's very true it's an onion and you

402
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,639
keep as you dig into the genetics you

403
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,160
realize there's just there's

404
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,000
many more layers to the data from the

405
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,879
transcriptomics the proteomics

406
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,039
all the methylation that's going on so

407
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,240
it is uh it can in fact be

408
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:48,159
a rabbit hole in that regard but um

409
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,399
on the bright side this is a plant

410
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,799
that's largely not been studied yet

411
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,879
and when you look back over the last 20

412
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,000
years where they have applied genetics

413
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,799
to plants

414
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,120
the productivity gains are just massive

415
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,958
um

416
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,399
they've just the agricultural revolution

417
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,319
that's happened is

418
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,759
as clear as day now that like since they

419
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,600
sequence the rice genome and the wheat

420
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,958
genome you can see the number of traits

421
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,399
that they're starting to discover and

422
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,518
how they can use that to breed for more

423
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,839
efficiency

424
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,799
um it's it's something when you when you

425
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,480
see those papers

426
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,479
you start to recognize that like the

427
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,600
carrying capacity of the planet isn't as

428
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,480
limited as we might think

429
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,278
yes that we are going to get more and

430
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,399
more effective

431
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,720
at uh at biology and and

432
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,399
how we as humans fit into that biology

433
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,759
in a way that isn't as wasteful as it is

434
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,519
today

435
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,278
yeah exactly i mean something that comes

436
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,000
to mind is like um

437
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,439
you know in the classic story and movie

438
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,480
jurassic park where

439
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,480
the idea that life finds a way you know

440
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,759
studying studying these things helps you

441
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,519
understand how

442
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:52,639
life is so adaptive and able to

443
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,399
um you know reveal different traits that

444
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,278
you never would have imagined might have

445
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,159
been

446
00:13:55,278 --> 00:14:00,159
you know possible um in order to you

447
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,639
know continue persisting throughout time

448
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,399
and

449
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,919
it's interesting to see humans role in

450
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,078
that i think um

451
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:09,759
something that i think about a lot um

452
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,198
you know sometimes people have a

453
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,759
tendency to talk about humans as if

454
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,399
they're outside of nature

455
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,919
right yeah and and you know in the sense

456
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,839
of this work it's

457
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,838
you know i don't think of it that way at

458
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,040
all like we are we are part of nature we

459
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,120
are part of how

460
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,480
life is unfolding and and interacting

461
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,360
with itself and

462
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,000
so in this in this funny way you know

463
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,600
people

464
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,360
studying genomics doing this work

465
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,360
unlocking these tools and

466
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,399
understanding how to be more conscious

467
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,440
and how we

468
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,198
influence life and that sort of thing

469
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,839
it's interesting it's like mother nature

470
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,039
doing these things you know through

471
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,160
itself but using humans

472
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:50,799
as a tool um to this it is it

473
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,399
does bring up a lot of um controversy

474
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,039
right in terms of gmo

475
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,958
and should we should we be are we part

476
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,480
of nature when we start modifying nature

477
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,399
and um

478
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,399
is this analogous to beavers building

479
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,320
dams and bees building beehives and all

480
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,480
the other toolbookers out there

481
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,560
uh are we meant to utilize or intellect

482
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,159
to do this to nature and that's uh

483
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,399
um that's a deep topic that can go on

484
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,000
for days but um

485
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,519
my general sense on it is there's

486
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,159
there's multiple different ways one can

487
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,799
be

488
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,838
uh performing gmo i mean arguably mendel

489
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,159
was doing emo

490
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,519
it was genetic genetically directing a

491
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,600
breeding program

492
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,440
uh and we can do that today too but even

493
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,959
at a faster pace because we have

494
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,360
basically better measurements we're not

495
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,799
just looking at maybe the color of the

496
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,399
peas we're actually looking at the

497
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,159
cannabinoids which you can't see with

498
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,278
your eyes or you're looking at the genes

499
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,879
that encode them

500
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,039
so that you can track these things at a

501
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,320
much faster pace but i think we're also

502
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,519
going to be confronted in the next few

503
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,480
years with

504
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,959
how does the community feel about

505
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,278
removing genes from the genome

506
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,078
not actually adding any foreign content

507
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,639
but maybe

508
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,439
it's important that we delete a couple

509
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,519
um

510
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,600
rare cannabinoids so we can comply with

511
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,278
the usda's hemp blocks

512
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,959
right there are some leaky cannabinoid

513
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,240
synthase genes in the genome and some of

514
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,719
them you can get rid of some of them you

515
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,879
can't

516
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,800
depending on what your goals are and

517
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,399
i've seen rumors and maybe even a couple

518
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,838
patent applications implying some people

519
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,559
have gone about deleting uh

520
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,079
these thc phase um i don't think you

521
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:17,359
need gmo to do that because you can find

522
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:18,239
plenty of plants that don't have it and

523
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,600
just breedful

524
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,360
let's say it was some other gene you

525
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,800
wanted to get rid of

526
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,919
i think that's going to kind of come our

527
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,399
way i think the other thing we're going

528
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,198
to see

529
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,399
are people who are trying to be very

530
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,198
cognizant of the fact that

531
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,720
gmo has a marketing problem right now

532
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,879
that they're going to try to do

533
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,480
manipulations with the plant's own genes

534
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,480
they're going to maybe take

535
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,920
the chlorop take the chloroplast genome

536
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,519
and add stuff to it because the

537
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,198
chloroplast genome sits at

538
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,639
extraordinarily high copy number

539
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,879
and you might get more expression

540
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,799
putting certain genes there

541
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,320
there's other people who have thought

542
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,120
about putting other markers on the y

543
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,519
chromosome

544
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,159
as well and find males from a drone

545
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,360
flight

546
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,799
and oh interesting yeah

547
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,399
that's probably going to require a

548
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,319
foreign gene i don't know of a gene and

549
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,640
cannabis off hand that might in fact

550
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,919
do produce that marker but someone the

551
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,520
obvious one is

552
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,600
green fluorescent protein which was

553
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,359
pulled out of a jellyfish

554
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,279
that's used to mark all types of other

555
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,678
transgenic plants and

556
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,798
you could pop that into the y chromosome

557
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,959
and have your plants

558
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,798
glow in a certain wavelength such that a

559
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,519
drone flame can identify males or rip

560
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:23,838
them out

561
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,359
and those males presumably won't

562
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:25,759
propagate if you're good at removing

563
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,198
them

564
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,119
but there's always a risk that they'll

565
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,600
make pollen that could spread and then

566
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,439
there's a

567
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,839
property rights issue as to who you know

568
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,759
did you did you get your pollen into my

569
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,959
field and who's responsible for that and

570
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,480
um with all of these modifications uh

571
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,079
that also tends to bring the elephant

572
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,640
into the room which is patent rights

573
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,319
um it's easier to get patent rights on

574
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,600
things that are clearly man-madified

575
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,200
than things that have been naturally

576
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,119
bred

577
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,640
there are breeders rights there are

578
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,839
plant patents and there are utility

579
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,759
patents which we're seeing roll out

580
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,959
right now and they can cover naturally

581
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,279
occurring plants

582
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,400
but it's far easier to get something

583
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,599
through the patent office

584
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,120
if you've clearly changed it from nature

585
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,439
i don't necessarily agree with that

586
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,199
moral philosophy but that's

587
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,720
the facts of the matter that's what we

588
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,160
have

589
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,079
so i think we're going to be faced with

590
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,759
a lot of these things sooner than we

591
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,439
realized if you actually go through the

592
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,160
patent office today

593
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,519
you will find patents in there that have

594
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,400
cannabis in there where they have

595
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,279
put glyphosate resistance into them they

596
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,600
have put

597
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,119
human p450s into them to modify

598
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,959
cannabinoids so that

599
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,639
they are more water soluble upon

600
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,440
extraction

601
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,960
there have been ones that i suspect

602
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,960
they're going to be ones

603
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,240
working on c3 to c4 photosynthesis

604
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,759
conversions and

605
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,279
there's a host of these mods that are

606
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,720
already in the patent office this

607
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,359
doesn't mean the technology works yet

608
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,200
right patents have no obligation to work

609
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,199
there's anti-gravity devices out there

610
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,840
right they're just ideas

611
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,440
but um usually people don't file those

612
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,119
unless there's some preliminary data

613
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,640
because the expense of filing isn't

614
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,798
something you just do on a

615
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,080
on a brain fart yeah you actually want

616
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:03,440
to make sure it's worth calling the

617
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,000
lawyers for so

618
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,360
um i know i see a wave of all of this

619
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,200
innovation coming

620
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,959
uh into a community that has very

621
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,360
diverse opinions on it

622
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,720
and i'm kind of kind of curious where

623
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,599
that's all going to go

624
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,079
yeah i agree it'll be uh over the next

625
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,918
um

626
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,839
10 to 20 years it's going to be very

627
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,600
interesting to see how

628
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:27,279
everything evolves and how the industry

629
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,918
accepts certain technologies

630
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,639
and and rejects others very very

631
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,240
interested especially when you have

632
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,320
like like you were talking about just a

633
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,000
second ago with thca you have these

634
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,879
market dynamics influencing

635
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,599
some of that you know where you've got

636
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,240
um

637
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,918
people that are more so maybe now than

638
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,120
ever feeling that pressure

639
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,120
of needing to find um

640
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,159
genetics that are going to ensure that

641
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,759
their you know livelihood stays intact

642
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,440
now that the farm bill has passed and

643
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,879
you know we'll see how it changes over

644
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,720
the years

645
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,159
but i know that's why there's you know a

646
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,600
big push now for

647
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,080
cbg dominant cbga dominant cultivars and

648
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,879
everything

649
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,759
but they're still getting thc um in some

650
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,640
of those

651
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,919
um so it's interesting and this this

652
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,200
starts to segue into

653
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,679
some of the research i wanted to talk

654
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,200
about but before we get into all of that

655
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,960
to set up a good foundation can you

656
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,319
describe a little bit of

657
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,079
um some of the tools and techniques that

658
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,240
are used to study dna

659
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,759
and kind of uh keep in mind that some of

660
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,880
our listeners don't have any background

661
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,079
with any of this so

662
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,000
sure yeah yeah absolutely so um there's

663
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,918
there's generally two different types of

664
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,400
um dna sequencers that are out there

665
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,880
there are

666
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,480
there are sequences that are used to

667
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,039
re-sequence a genome

668
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,599
generally at much lower cost uh if the

669
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:47,679
genome

670
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,199
if a reference genome is already known

671
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,240
okay so let's say like

672
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,759
we did the human genome back in 2000 um

673
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,440
it wasn't really finished and still

674
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,960
isn't finished today there's still some

675
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,600
centromeres that haven't been fully

676
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,558
sequenced yet but you know 99 of the

677
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,240
genomes known

678
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,759
there's a large effort trying to make

679
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,279
sure we have maps across all the

680
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,480
telomeres and centromeres right now and

681
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,079
they've managed to diverse a couple

682
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,440
chromosomes from from telomere to

683
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,839
telomere

684
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,840
but once you have that reference genome

685
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,038
since the human human population is

686
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,879
fairly inbred

687
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,640
we differ maybe by one in a thousand

688
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,240
letters in the genome

689
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,159
what that means is you can use a much

690
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,839
cheaper sequencer to resequence

691
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,080
other people's genomes and then just

692
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,279
compare it to the reference

693
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,960
and these are this is usually where

694
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,079
alumina comes into play they can only

695
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,759
sequence about 100

696
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,599
bases of dna maybe out to 300

697
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,519
some extreme cases they can do paired

698
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,000
ends or 600 base pair reads where they

699
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:39,839
do

700
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,759
two 300 base pair reads aimed at each

701
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,678
other uh and that gives you

702
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,879
um it does really well in the human

703
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,880
genome you can remap

704
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,640
and and and sequence people's genomes

705
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,880
for probably under 500

706
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,799
now um that doesn't include all the

707
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,400
analysis but just the raw cost of the

708
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,960
sequence is getting close to

709
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,120
close to that point um now with that

710
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,880
said when you're re-sequencing

711
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,639
and you're mapping to a reference that

712
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,000
is fairly representative of the entire

713
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,840
human population

714
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,200
uh you can figure out where all the

715
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,678
single letter changes are

716
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,279
really easily it's a bit more

717
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,280
challenging to figure out where

718
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,359
entire chapters of the genome are

719
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,519
missing with those technologies because

720
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,639
when the read gets shorter than the size

721
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,558
of the variance

722
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,400
it's very difficult for those reads to

723
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,519
actually detect the variant

724
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,080
so so as you approach like 25 to 50 base

725
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,319
pair

726
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,240
changes in the genome the short reads

727
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,960
systems start to stumble and miss

728
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,558
important genetic variation so there's

729
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,798
been an effort to increase those read

730
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,319
lengths and most of the zephyrs have

731
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,079
gone in the direction of sequencing

732
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,639
single molecules of dna

733
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,519
so that they they get a cleaner signal

734
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,200
it's very

735
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,558
the illumina systems right now in order

736
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,960
to read the dna

737
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,158
they first amplify the dna to a couple

738
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,319
thousand copies

739
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,320
and then when you're sequencing that

740
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,720
particular colony

741
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,960
you're actually sequencing a thousand

742
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,519
molecules that are all marching in step

743
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,120
down the dna strand and what invariably

744
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:04,000
happens as you go out and read length

745
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,798
each one of those

746
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,759
reactions is probably 99.9 efficient but

747
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:09,599
over time

748
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,519
they start to get out of phase the the

749
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,038
molecules get out of sync and it gets

750
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,000
very difficult to start reading the

751
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:15,839
sequence

752
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,038
so to get around that that synchrony

753
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,959
problem uh

754
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,720
what the the direction the technology

755
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,079
moved was to sequence single molecules

756
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,600
which is much harder to do

757
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,199
because you need to be a thousand times

758
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,480
more sensitive but once you're reading

759
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,240
single molecules

760
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,079
you never have to worry about the rate

761
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,558
at which the polymerase decides to read

762
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,720
the molecule you just let the thing run

763
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,720
and you get to read the dna as the thing

764
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,798
is copying it in real time

765
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,000
so uh the two sequencers that are

766
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:42,639
probably most known for this

767
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,440
are pacific biosciences sequencers and

768
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,320
then

769
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,798
an upstart sequencer that's i probably

770
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:52,319
have one floating around here somewhere

771
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,839
it's called oxford nanopore um and uh

772
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,200
they they they're much smaller

773
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,319
footprints but they're much noisier

774
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,000
these things

775
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:03,519
will thread dna through a biological

776
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
protein pore and when the dna gets

777
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,879
threaded through

778
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,919
that pore uh the current starts to

779
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,679
change on you

780
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,600
based on the sequence context that's in

781
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,360
the pore so the thing might zip through

782
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,119
at 500 bases a second

783
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,399
and as it's doing so it's leaving a

784
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,000
current profile

785
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,320
that tells you some information about

786
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,839
the sequence um they're about 90

787
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,158
accurate they're getting better they're

788
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,599
it's a very quickly improving platform

789
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,440
but the interesting thing about that

790
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,119
platform is it's so it's so small

791
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,720
it's portable you can bring it to

792
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,439
coronavirus outbreaks you can bring it

793
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,600
to africa

794
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,200
i see all right and then you usually

795
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,319
need a hell of a lot more bioinformatics

796
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,319
in the back end to clean up the signal

797
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,519
those are um the read length and those

798
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,599
are unlimited right now

799
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,359
um they have had reads go out to two

800
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,599
million bases on those things so it's a

801
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,439
massive breakthrough on reed length

802
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,839
um somewhere that's a little bit more of

803
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,000
a compromise between the two

804
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,319
is a system that also sequences single

805
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,440
molecules but the way it reads it

806
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,839
is using a zero mode wave guide

807
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,200
which is basically an array of very very

808
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,519
small holes

809
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,278
and there is a phenomenon when you're

810
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,558
trying to image molecules

811
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,960
single molecules in particular which are

812
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,158
very small is the the problem you have

813
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,679
with anything that uses

814
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,440
light or fluorescence is that

815
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,320
fluorescence is actually a fairly

816
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,679
large wavelength um if you look at the

817
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,359
wavelength of blue light for instance

818
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,880
it's 500 nanometers and you're trying to

819
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,038
measure things that are angstrom so it's

820
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,840
kind of like shining a floodlight

821
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:29,519
on top of a speck of sand trying to

822
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,278
watch the speck of sand

823
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:32,480
and if you have more than one speck of

824
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:34,319
sand in the flood light you really don't

825
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,720
know what you're watching

826
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,759
and so what they had to do is build

827
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,038
these tools

828
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,400
that focus light into a smaller diameter

829
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:43,519
than the actual wavelength of light and

830
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,038
that's done with the

831
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,200
technology you can see in the front of

832
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:49,038
everybody's microwave oven the microwave

833
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,720
actually has this remote waveguide there

834
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:51,759
that prevents those much larger

835
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,240
wavelengths from from

836
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,960
um from getting through but what happens

837
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,798
at the

838
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,640
at the surface of that never put your

839
00:25:56,798 --> 00:25:58,960
hand directly on the surface of that

840
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,159
thing

841
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,519
it won't let you because there's a

842
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,640
screen there but if you were to get

843
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,639
close enough to that

844
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,559
there would be a zeptoliter volume of

845
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,320
radiation coming through there

846
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,000
and that zeptoliter is enough to

847
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:13,119
illuminate a single polymerase

848
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,880
molecule copying a dna strand so pacbio

849
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,558
does this really elegant

850
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,559
device where they read eight million of

851
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,200
these holes at a single time

852
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,399
and they've managed to be able to put

853
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,240
circular molecules

854
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,840
into this thing so when the polymerase

855
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,159
grabs onto it and rolls

856
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,278
and starts to copy it it runs it around

857
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,120
like a gerbil wheel

858
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,558
over and over and over again so you end

859
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,319
up reading the forward strand

860
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,879
then the reverse strand then the forward

861
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:39,759
strand as you do this 30 or 40 times

862
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,159
you eliminate all the noise and they now

863
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,000
have

864
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,000
20 000 base pair reads that are 99.9

865
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,278
accurate which is like an absolute

866
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,119
remarkable breakthrough

867
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,480
and we've only had that in the last like

868
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,798
four months wow

869
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,839
um so much of the work that you see in

870
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:55,918
the paper we put out

871
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,359
actually used a technology of theirs

872
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,440
that was a little bit older that was

873
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:59,839
probably 50 fold less accurate but it

874
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,960
had

875
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,720
200 000 base pair reads we use that to

876
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,000
assemble a few of these cannabis genomes

877
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,519
and very recently we've gone

878
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,759
back and resequenced them with this

879
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,359
newer hifi chemistry that they have

880
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,960
um to even to you know improve the

881
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,879
references even further but

882
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,640
it's those two main tools that i think

883
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,399
are first are being used the most in

884
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,000
cannabis right now is that we we don't

885
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,639
have good references

886
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,159
and the human genome is easy in

887
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,038
comparison to the cannabis genome to

888
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,600
sequence

889
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,119
a couple of the things that make genomes

890
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,359
easier to sequence is that

891
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,398
if the mother and the father genomes are

892
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,918
fairly similar

893
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,599
it gets they're easier to sequence and

894
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,480
that's the case with humans in case of

895
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,480
cannabis

896
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,000
there's probably a variant every 50

897
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,120
letters instead of a variant every

898
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,119
thousand wow

899
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,879
that's much more difficult to sequence

900
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,158
because um the mother and the father

901
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,278
genomes are like sequencing two

902
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,480
different genomes that are blended

903
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:49,599
together

904
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,798
and that can confuse a lot of the

905
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:52,000
algorithms trying to put the sequence

906
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,960
back together

907
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,200
so the the long reads on these platforms

908
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,480
and

909
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,720
particularly the long ones that have

910
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,919
accuracy are what are really

911
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,319
shining through they're the ones that

912
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,159
are putting the genomes together in in

913
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,678
in perfect order near perfect order

914
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,240
right now um

915
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,399
and uh that's enabling us to start to

916
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,159
ask can we build a single reference for

917
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,398
cannabis where we can resort to these

918
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,080
cheaper tools for mapping

919
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,079
and i think they've already still out on

920
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,839
that we we do do a lot of illumina

921
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,519
sequencing the pre-print that we have up

922
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,359
there has 40 genomes that were done with

923
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:23,759
aluminum mapped back to the reads that

924
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:25,199
were

925
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:28,000
the references that were built with pac

926
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,480
bio but one thing that we discovered

927
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,119
doing this is that while there's a

928
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,079
single letter change every 50 bases

929
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,479
uh we're finding there's an equally high

930
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:38,879
rate

931
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,919
of like entire chapters being deleted

932
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,039
this is what people

933
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:46,240
call like structural variation uh

934
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,599
and so that pro that um preprint listed

935
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,599
about 58 million

936
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,359
single base pair changes in the 40

937
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:54,000
genomes that we looked at

938
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,678
but in one of the the trios that we

939
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,919
sequenced which is a mother and

940
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,600
a father in its offspring you did that

941
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,679
all with pac bio so we had the

942
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,079
visibility to see these large chapters

943
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,080
being

944
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,759
deleted and added and we're seeing

945
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,599
upwards is about an eighth of the genome

946
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,919
that's in structural variation between

947
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,480
just an inbred cross

948
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,320
that's an enormous amount of genetic

949
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,960
material that is different

950
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,678
uh just by crossing siblings right so

951
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,679
let alone

952
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,038
if you step out of the cross like a type

953
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,720
one with a type three

954
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,558
you're gonna it's probably gonna be even

955
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,558
more diverse than that

956
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,599
and it's beginning to beg the question

957
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,398
whether

958
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,918
we should we should go with the old root

959
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,278
like we did with human where we make a

960
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,640
reference genome and map everything to

961
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:36,159
it it might just be

962
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,520
the time and where the technology is

963
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,120
mature enough where you just forget the

964
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,879
short reads altogether and just always

965
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,959
use something like that bio

966
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,399
uh that's a cost question right now bio

967
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,720
is probably 10 fold more expensive than

968
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,319
illumina so a lot of people want to

969
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,240
want to try and leverage the aluminum

970
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,158
platforms as best they can

971
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,440
but if you really want to know what's

972
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,559
going on

973
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,240
a single sql chip from uh pack bio which

974
00:29:56,558 --> 00:29:59,918
are usually a couple grand

975
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,440
you can probably get a trio sequence on

976
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,080
one of those now

977
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,360
so we we tend to recommend people in

978
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,558
breeding programs

979
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,759
if you don't know where your parents

980
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:08,398
came from and you're not confident in

981
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:10,720
them at least

982
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:13,278
sequence the parents with pac bio and

983
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,519
then you can do all your f1s and f2s

984
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,480
with the cheaper tools but if you're

985
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:18,558
starting with

986
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,399
a ref a distant reference like the ones

987
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,240
in ncbi where you don't even have access

988
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:23,839
to the germplasm and they may not even

989
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,599
be the same type of plant

990
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:27,359
most of the references up there are type

991
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,879
3 plants

992
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,959
you're you're going to have a bad time

993
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,240
um there's so much difference between

994
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,679
those references that uh

995
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,319
they're a great starting point let's say

996
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,399
but um i think the direction

997
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:39,678
the field is going to go is in these

998
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:40,959
tour depan genome

999
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,200
where you if you're going to build a

1000
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,000
reference it needs to include type ones

1001
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,000
type twos type threes type four plants

1002
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,839
so that we have all the industrial um

1003
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,200
uses of cannabis in there

1004
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,119
as a reference so we're not missing

1005
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,120
genes right not just focusing on the

1006
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:58,079
drug type cultivars and

1007
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:00,398
right right or the hemp one right right

1008
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,960
yeah exactly yeah and can you describe

1009
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:05,038
um really quickly for our listeners what

1010
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,399
are type one two three and four

1011
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,919
uh oh cannabis varieties uh so this goes

1012
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:11,759
back to etienne de meyer's work and

1013
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,880
probably dave watson's and few others

1014
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,798
they um they classified cannabis into

1015
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,278
five categories um these need to be

1016
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,278
refined but this is just a historical

1017
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,119
classification where type 1 plants are

1018
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:26,558
thc dominant and tend to have a

1019
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:28,798
23 to 1 ratio of thc cbd

1020
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:29,759
type 3 plants are cbd dominant plants

1021
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:33,038
and have the inverse

1022
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:36,079
relationship type 2s have both genes

1023
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:38,079
and they make both thc and cbd

1024
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,439
uh and as you get into type 4s they

1025
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,519
don't have either gene they don't have

1026
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,720
thc synthase or cbd synthase and they

1027
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,519
they just make the precursor cannabinol

1028
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,880
and uh type fives are broken even

1029
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,679
further upstream and don't even make

1030
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,278
cannabidiol

1031
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,759
yeah and so they're cannabinoid free

1032
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:55,359
plants now what we've come to learn

1033
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,919
after doing all the sequencing is that

1034
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,839
was

1035
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,440
a remarkable classification system they

1036
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,398
figured out not having ever seen the

1037
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,880
genome

1038
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,879
so they figured all this out kind of the

1039
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,039
old school way with mendel so they don't

1040
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,000
really know or haven't really never

1041
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:10,480
published where

1042
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,599
those markers are in the genome uh the

1043
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,120
pre-print we put out

1044
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,639
at least attempted to do the most

1045
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,038
popular ones that we find

1046
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,120
and the most common variations we see in

1047
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,798
these cannabis genomes that map to this

1048
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,518
nomenclature system are

1049
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,119
the the type 1 plants have a broken cbd

1050
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,240
gene so they really only have thc

1051
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,798
synthase there

1052
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,440
and whatever cbd is coming through is

1053
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:31,839
probably

1054
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,720
uh promiscuous synthesis from the thc

1055
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,439
synthase gene

1056
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,480
these these genes are not 100 pure they

1057
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,640
don't make

1058
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,240
uh only one compound they tend to

1059
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,399
predominantly make one compound but leak

1060
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,558
a little bit of the others

1061
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:45,439
likewise if you look at the cbd plants

1062
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,558
they usually

1063
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,240
have the thc gene completely deleted

1064
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,759
and the reason why we think the

1065
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,278
nomenclature system probably needs some

1066
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,240
more refinement is that there are some

1067
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:58,640
rare cases where you can have a thc gene

1068
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,000
be present in a type 3 plan but it has a

1069
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,159
point mutation in the gene

1070
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,599
that's deactivating it but the genes

1071
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,360
still

1072
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,038
and so that can throw off some testing

1073
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,199
tools we've had testing tools in the

1074
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,119
marketplace now for three or four years

1075
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,440
that try to just look for the popular

1076
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,158
ones the the full gene deletions but

1077
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,679
they're

1078
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,278
they get tripped up when there's a

1079
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,480
actually a thc gene there

1080
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:19,839
and there's a point mutation that's

1081
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,440
killing it because the assay is not

1082
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:22,398
sensitive to pick up that single base

1083
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,798
change

1084
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:26,558
um likewise if both of these genes are

1085
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,158
missing from the genome

1086
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:30,158
there it's usually a good sign that it's

1087
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,360
a type 4 plant and

1088
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,519
so a lot of people have been using the

1089
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:36,639
sequence information to breed

1090
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,240
for cbg plants right now because when

1091
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,600
you have both thc

1092
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,798
and cbd synthase is deleted uh

1093
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:46,798
you have less synthase genes that could

1094
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:49,278
be leaking thc expression

1095
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,720
yeah uh and the the the other genes that

1096
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,000
we're paying close attention to in that

1097
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,159
in that pre-print

1098
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,599
are the cannabi chromium genes because

1099
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,480
those are the next classes

1100
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:00,000
related genes to each different base and

1101
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,720
the plant for some reasons made like

1102
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,919
eight of them

1103
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,159
uh it has got more of those than the thc

1104
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,600
and cbd's genes

1105
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,039
they're not heavily expressed in a lot

1106
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:10,159
of the tissues we've looked at but again

1107
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,279
we haven't looked very

1108
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,800
deep at um i think to really find can

1109
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,480
have a chromium expression you might

1110
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,560
need to be looking at

1111
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,320
different time points in flowering and

1112
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,078
maybe in veg states

1113
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,359
to really see it turn on we we happen to

1114
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,960
see the most kind of a chromium

1115
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:25,759
expression in male plants and i don't

1116
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,000
know why

1117
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,960
oh interesting yeah that was the only

1118
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,320
place we actually got our

1119
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,398
expression that study were in male

1120
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,320
flowers and uh

1121
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:35,598
and the jamaican lion plants that we

1122
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,280
sequenced have a

1123
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,519
a can have a chromie cassette a lot of

1124
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,240
plants don't even have that cassette so

1125
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,759
um but but that's another gene that that

1126
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,078
people like to keep their eye on

1127
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,520
if they're trying to breathe a wider

1128
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,039
spread between

1129
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:53,280
um a cannabinoid and thc that's

1130
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:55,838
compliant with the usda regs

1131
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,839
is um they pay very close attention to

1132
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:59,599
the copy number of thc synthetic cbd

1133
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:00,880
synthase and cdc's and this and that

1134
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,280
usually gives you

1135
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,200
some guidelines as to how much you might

1136
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,200
leak yeah yeah

1137
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:10,239
have you um going specifically to cbc

1138
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:12,159
just for a second

1139
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,159
um in any of the work that you've done

1140
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:18,319
have you seen any

1141
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:21,679
correlations with um uh differences

1142
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,480
in environmental qualities that that

1143
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,919
might influence um cbc in any sort of

1144
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,119
way and the reason i ask is there's some

1145
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,760
old literature

1146
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,599
i mean possibly i can't remember when it

1147
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,520
came out is possibly late 90s early

1148
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,559
2000s so it could be totally irrelevant

1149
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:36,719
now

1150
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:37,759
but it was based on looking at some of

1151
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:39,519
the data that was coming out of the

1152
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,760
university of mississippi

1153
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:45,199
and um and some of the

1154
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,119
some of the accessions that they had

1155
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,039
they were seeing higher levels of cbc

1156
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,720
and there was speculation that it

1157
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,159
might have something to do with humidity

1158
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,919
or something like that given that the

1159
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,519
plants were grown in mississippi

1160
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,599
versus you know more arid environments

1161
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:59,519
where they normally would be grown

1162
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,680
so that's it's a really good point and

1163
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,480
one thing that that surprised us in this

1164
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:04,719
whole study

1165
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,320
is after we sequenced um these 40

1166
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,159
genomes and there's a figure

1167
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,920
in the paper i should point people to in

1168
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:11,358
this that may give them a perspective on

1169
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,760
it let's see which one it is

1170
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:14,719
i think it's figure seven eight or nine

1171
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,640
uh

1172
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,759
what we looked at was the presence of

1173
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:21,039
these um copy number variations

1174
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,040
your audience probably can't see this

1175
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,559
but but what shocked us

1176
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:27,679
uh we'll maybe post in show notes or

1177
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:29,519
something is that um

1178
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:30,960
blue means they're deleted and red means

1179
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,079
that you have the genes the jamaican

1180
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,599
line strains are here

1181
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,519
purple they have they're heterozygous

1182
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,039
for it but what was shocking to us

1183
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,559
is that there are all of these different

1184
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,639
strains out there that don't have

1185
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,719
this kind prominent cluster this isn't

1186
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,639
one gene this is two billion bases of

1187
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:47,358
sequence that's deleted

1188
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,319
and what's on that contig that's been

1189
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:49,358
deleted

1190
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,800
or the portion of the kind of gets

1191
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:51,838
deleted happens to be three or four

1192
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,720
other genes

1193
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,880
that are involved in pathogen response

1194
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,199
there's an aquaporin gene in there

1195
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,559
there's um there's a few of them listed

1196
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:02,799
in the paper but

1197
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,078
uh so if there's any cannabinoid that

1198
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,320
would be

1199
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,320
most directly linked to environmental

1200
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,280
conditions and perhaps pathogen response

1201
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,359
or humidity

1202
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,480
i i would pin it on that one because you

1203
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:13,759
can see that there's a

1204
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,519
there's a common deletion in the

1205
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,280
population that

1206
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:18,880
when it's gone you lose some of these

1207
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,839
other genes with those cannabinoid

1208
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,440
synthase genes

1209
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,960
and so those plants arguably are either

1210
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,480
going to be more prone to pathogens or

1211
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,240
have a different response to stress

1212
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,760
um then i mean one of them is actually a

1213
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:29,118
gibberellin transporter

1214
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,800
all right that gibberellin's a really

1215
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,358
important plant hormone and i don't know

1216
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,119
how

1217
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,799
how many more the genome has i've got to

1218
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,000
go and look at that but just seeing

1219
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,920
one of those things get get deleted um

1220
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,480
means the the plant's probably gonna

1221
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,240
have a really odd response to stress

1222
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,838
and it's in very close proximity to the

1223
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:48,078
can have a chromium genes that

1224
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,400
you know that that might be uh you know

1225
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,000
reason to believe that uh yeah the

1226
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,760
kind of chromium expression might be a

1227
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,159
little bit more linked to um

1228
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,560
to these these types of changes wow

1229
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:02,078
really fascinating this is already like

1230
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:04,078
making the the uh gerbil wheels in my

1231
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,760
in my head spin because that's something

1232
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,440
i've always wondered about and

1233
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,880
and hearing about this this genetic work

1234
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,519
is nice because you know with my

1235
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,200
background

1236
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,440
looking at the the chemistry of the

1237
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,919
plant and doing um testing that sort of

1238
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,519
thing

1239
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,358
cbc is one of these problematic

1240
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,079
cannabinoids where um

1241
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:21,598
if your method is not really dialed in

1242
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,760
to really

1243
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,240
measure cbc accurately you can get a lot

1244
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,079
of other compounds that can co-elude

1245
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,519
around the same time as cbc there are

1246
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,039
isomers of

1247
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,079
other cannabinoids that show up around

1248
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,719
the same time so you know something i

1249
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,920
say to a lot of cultivators and

1250
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,118
extractors that are trying to get

1251
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,920
information on cbc

1252
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,760
is you know some of the data that's

1253
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,639
floating around on your test results

1254
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,920
about cbc

1255
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:47,838
you can kind of take with a grain of

1256
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,200
salt that might be cbc might be

1257
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:52,480
something else

1258
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:54,000
um it's one of the it's just coming out

1259
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,920
of the labs i just know it's

1260
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,440
one of those problematic cannabinoids

1261
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,440
that a lot of times is not super

1262
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,880
accurate compared to you know cbd

1263
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,079
thc or cbg even um

1264
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,079
yeah well that's a that's an

1265
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,680
industry-wide problem in that um

1266
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,440
we have a hard time as it is correlating

1267
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,159
some of these genetics to the particular

1268
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,039
chemotypes

1269
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:14,319
because we're usually relying on

1270
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,000
genetics and

1271
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,599
genetics from all over the world and but

1272
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,119
then you know chemotype testing that's

1273
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,800
done in 50 different laboratories that

1274
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,320
all run different methods and it's very

1275
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,200
hard to

1276
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,160
standardize uh and and get get results

1277
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,598
that you believe in unless you take

1278
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:31,679
control over all that and run it locally

1279
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,760
that means you're usually studying

1280
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,358
plants that are only within your state

1281
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,800
um because you can't get the flower

1282
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,559
material across state lines legally

1283
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,839
unless you're dealing with type 3 plants

1284
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:43,759
so it's there's a lot of limitations i

1285
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,920
think to the research because that and

1286
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,200
and as your other cast have mentioned we

1287
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,159
do need to be looking at

1288
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:51,279
the flavonoids yeah can flavon a e and a

1289
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:52,719
variety of these other

1290
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,119
um cannabinoids that people are starting

1291
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,279
to find like the italians the thcp

1292
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,800
is probably at very low levels and some

1293
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,400
cultivars that we just don't know about

1294
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,119
because no one's been looking for it in

1295
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,639
our standards

1296
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,240
yet exactly yeah yeah i mean the um

1297
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:08,400
you know cannabis as a biochemical

1298
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,039
factory is um

1299
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,720
geez the potential there is is really

1300
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,279
incredible it's

1301
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,639
you know um something i i also say to

1302
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,160
people a lot is you know if you're a

1303
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:19,759
researcher wanting to get into cannabis

1304
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,039
research it's an exciting time because

1305
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,040
there's

1306
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:25,599
uh depending on you know if you can

1307
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,480
think outside of the box of just thc and

1308
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,960
cbd

1309
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,760
um there's so much low-hanging fruit to

1310
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,599
pursue

1311
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,960
regarding research projects and stuff

1312
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,760
there's so much work that needs to be

1313
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,400
done

1314
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,400
um and that's why it's exciting you know

1315
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,318
i have mixed feelings about the way the

1316
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,760
hemp industry is going but one thing

1317
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:45,039
that's exciting with

1318
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,400
labs needing to get dea licenses to

1319
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:52,079
handle him um this changes the game

1320
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:56,079
as far as labs being able to work with

1321
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,880
um like universities or even you know

1322
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,560
other labs that have been you know kind

1323
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,480
of slowly trying to do cannabis

1324
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,920
research on a federally legal level and

1325
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,440
have you know kind of struggled and

1326
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,358
there hasn't been a strong

1327
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,720
network of researchers there to kind of

1328
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:10,559
support each other

1329
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:12,078
um that's going to change a bit like

1330
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,318
already i've done a little bit of work

1331
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,160
with some universities to help them get

1332
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,079
um sort of caught up on some of the

1333
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:21,920
scientific literature and get

1334
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,440
some analytical methods um in sort of

1335
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,960
uh development and moving towards

1336
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,480
validation and stuff and i'm really

1337
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,159
excited to see

1338
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,240
what momentum we're going to see when

1339
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:33,679
these labs are able to actually

1340
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:35,838
move material to one another um and

1341
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,199
and universities are feeling comfortable

1342
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,519
not risking

1343
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:41,279
you know their funding and that sort of

1344
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,838
thing to actually touch cannabis

1345
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,560
um yeah that is starting to happen we're

1346
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:46,639
seeing um

1347
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:48,078
cornell get funding now we're seeing

1348
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:49,838
harvard get now

1349
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,839
but you're right about the da issue that

1350
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:54,480
that's almost going to guarantee

1351
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,519
that labs that know the least about the

1352
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,358
plant are the ones

1353
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,880
that are put in charge of it yeah it's a

1354
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,799
good point yeah

1355
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,760
and you know and the testament to this

1356
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,119
is just look at what happened to full

1357
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,040
spectrum labs right they

1358
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,880
they were an operating cannabis lab who

1359
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,440
tried to play by the book

1360
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,240
applied for a dea license and since they

1361
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,760
were at the time

1362
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,598
presently handling cannabis they got

1363
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,520
raided and shut down

1364
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,359
right so anyone who's currently right

1365
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,039
now handling cannabis

1366
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,519
uh they're gonna be really reserved to

1367
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:22,880
go and apply for a da license knowing

1368
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,920
what's happened in the past that's

1369
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,318
almost gonna invite

1370
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,519
a dea raid unless you set up a

1371
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:28,800
completely new business that's

1372
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:30,639
financially untethered

1373
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,839
and and then somehow get your

1374
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:34,400
intelligence in there

1375
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:35,519
and then apply it's just uh um it's

1376
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,000
certainly going to favor

1377
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,920
pre-existing dea laboratories and from

1378
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,519
the ones that i know they're great at

1379
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,159
picking up cannabinoids and urine but

1380
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:46,079
they're awful exactly

1381
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,598
yeah they've been focused on toxicology

1382
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,519
and that's that's really the only

1383
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,838
the only thing they've they've been

1384
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:53,679
really working on um

1385
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,880
yeah it's going to be interesting um

1386
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,919
there's going to be a

1387
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,400
learning curve for sure that um we're

1388
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,318
gonna

1389
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,240
have to wade through over the next

1390
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:05,279
several years while

1391
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:06,879
um labs get caught up but yeah thinking

1392
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,839
about the long term

1393
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,599
i think it's all um i mean of course i'd

1394
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:12,639
rather just see cannabis descheduled and

1395
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,640
then

1396
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,318
you don't have that right and then this

1397
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:19,039
is

1398
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,838
right yeah to study a plan is kind of

1399
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:21,519
crazy

1400
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:22,960
it is it absolutely is and that's

1401
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,280
something i always try to preface

1402
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,079
as much as i talk about you know part of

1403
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,680
my

1404
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,000
job on the side is helping people

1405
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,358
navigate these regulatory waters and

1406
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,039
and so i talk about it a lot kind of

1407
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,639
casually but you know i do like to point

1408
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:35,759
out it's like i don't want it to be this

1409
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:38,000
way

1410
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,280
i definitely don't yeah but it is and

1411
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,639
you know and it's what we have to work

1412
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,680
with until it changes

1413
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:44,719
um well um so segwaying into the the

1414
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:46,799
research that

1415
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:48,318
you know we've um been sort of dancing

1416
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,280
around let's let's talk about

1417
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:51,599
um the study that just recently put out

1418
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,760
so

1419
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,599
right now it's in a pre-print form

1420
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,760
but so there's a ton of data there in

1421
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,039
this research you looked at

1422
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,960
um a jamaican lion cultivar

1423
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:08,960
and yes and that wasn't

1424
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,240
go ahead oh as you say you were you were

1425
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,318
mapping the

1426
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:13,519
uh parents the siblings and you were

1427
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:16,000
looking at

1428
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,960
um genes related to cannabinoid

1429
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,280
expression

1430
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,880
uh sex expression and pathogen

1431
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,040
resistance is that right

1432
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,559
yes yeah and so just uh you know caution

1433
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:25,920
all of it it is a pre-print it's not

1434
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:27,920
been through peer review but all the

1435
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,720
data is public so anyone can grab the

1436
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,159
data and

1437
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,000
uh download it and play with it while

1438
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:33,519
it's going through peer review um

1439
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,880
koji is a great place to go if you want

1440
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:35,759
to look at the data it's a genome

1441
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,400
browser

1442
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,480
comparative if you just google c-o-g-e

1443
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,720
or comparative evolution

1444
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,838
or comparative genomics genome browser

1445
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:45,519
you'll you'll see a

1446
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:46,880
search in there for jamaican lion or for

1447
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,159
cannabis and you'll see a certified

1448
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,039
reference up there that has a lot of

1449
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:50,879
this data

1450
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:52,318
linked in it's got great graphical tools

1451
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,838
so you can you can kind of play around

1452
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:56,000
with this data yourself but

1453
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:58,078
yeah so the the the purpose of that

1454
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,119
project was to first build some good

1455
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,800
cannabis references

1456
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,838
um back in 2011 we sequenced the chem

1457
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,640
dog strain with

1458
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:07,358
these short read aluminum tools and

1459
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:09,199
those have

1460
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:10,559
we probably did a billion reads and when

1461
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,318
you try to assemble those reads the

1462
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:12,960
genome's so complex that you only get

1463
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:15,199
like

1464
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,358
uh puzzle pieces out that are about 3000

1465
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:19,919
liters long this is what we call a

1466
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:22,000
contig size in in genomics and you want

1467
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,480
those content sizes to ultimately be

1468
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,838
the full length of a chromosome it's

1469
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,358
rare they ever end up that way they

1470
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:28,960
usually are broken up into a couple

1471
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:30,400
pieces because the centromeres are hard

1472
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,480
to get through and some of the telomeres

1473
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,318
are hard to get through but um the human

1474
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,240
genome has one or two chromosomes after

1475
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:39,358
15 years of being declared finished

1476
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,399
done finally hip to tip so yeah we're

1477
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,000
going to do much better than that in

1478
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,358
cannabis it's going to happen faster

1479
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,559
because we get to stand on their

1480
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:46,480
shoulders but

1481
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:48,639
um so that there's this there's this

1482
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,639
term in the in the genomics field that

1483
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,239
measures the contiguity of genomes and

1484
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,799
it's known as the n50 number

1485
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,719
this is the average size of the length

1486
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,960
of the pieces of your puzzle

1487
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,000
and cannabis chromosomes are usually 60

1488
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,920
to 100 megabases

1489
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,440
in size and you'd love for your contents

1490
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,519
to be perfect stretches of

1491
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,280
60 million bases long i think the

1492
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:08,400
largest one we have in one of ours is 40

1493
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,079
megabases so it's

1494
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,160
it's close we're almost we're almost to

1495
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,079
perfection but the references we had

1496
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:16,078
when we started this project

1497
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,880
the n50 size i think the largest one at

1498
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:21,760
that time in genbank was about 150 kb

1499
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,680
so 150 000. so a big improvement from

1500
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,040
2011

1501
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,559
and then john page's group put a few out

1502
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:30,159
a few days after we released the

1503
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,679
jamaican line one they put one out from

1504
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:34,480
purple cushion vanilla

1505
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,559
and those inched up toward 400 i think

1506
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,039
sunrise put one out that's in the 750

1507
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,400
range

1508
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:41,920
uh 750 000 bases but the the real

1509
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,960
assembly gurus don't get excited until

1510
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,920
you're over a megabase

1511
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,119
um that's kind of like a a mental

1512
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,480
threshold that they want to see

1513
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,880
before they start considering a

1514
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,159
reference grade genome um and we still

1515
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,318
weren't quite there yet

1516
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,399
so we decided to keep sequencing and we

1517
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:57,440
just all that we did different than the

1518
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,440
people behind us

1519
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,559
uh was that we just jumped on board of

1520
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,159
the newer sequencers

1521
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:03,920
uh the latest and greatest chemistry

1522
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:05,838
just pushed the jamaican line reference

1523
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,240
above the megabase mark so it's

1524
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:09,599
currently at around 3.2 megabases on the

1525
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,279
preprint that we put forward so the

1526
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,359
average stretch of sequence in there is

1527
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,119
is a stretch of three and a half

1528
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:18,000
megabases long

1529
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,880
um now the other thing that's important

1530
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,239
is looking at

1531
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,358
the quality of the sequence to make sure

1532
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:22,159
there aren't a lot of errors because

1533
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:24,719
when you have

1534
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:26,639
58 million variants you don't want to be

1535
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:27,598
spending your time on 5 million ones

1536
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:29,679
that are wrong

1537
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,240
it's a lot of error to sift through so

1538
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,039
the the the more later sequencers tend

1539
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,598
to have

1540
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,039
a lot more um a lot better error rates

1541
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,119
and more accurate data

1542
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,639
now the other thing that you tend to do

1543
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,880
to really build a strong reference

1544
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:46,159
genome is you like to sequence a trio

1545
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,920
which is uh a cross basically a

1546
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,279
a mother father an offspring and the

1547
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,639
reason you do that

1548
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,640
is you can then triage your errors that

1549
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,239
that don't make any mendelian sense from

1550
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,000
the ones that should we call these

1551
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,118
mental errors and there's less than like

1552
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,440
a point two percent

1553
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,119
mental error rate in the in the jamaican

1554
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,240
lion trio that we have

1555
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,920
um so what that means is you look for

1556
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,078
variants in your offspring

1557
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,680
and you say do i see evidence of this in

1558
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,760
either of the parent if it's not either

1559
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,598
parent it's probably a sequencing error

1560
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,680
and you use that information to

1561
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,880
basically categorize what variants are

1562
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,358
real or wrong

1563
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,318
the other thing that usually has to go

1564
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:24,078
on when you're dealing with a new

1565
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,639
species and we're doing some work with

1566
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,839
this on google and a few other parties

1567
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,000
in the space

1568
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,679
is you usually have to retrain your

1569
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,039
algorithms that look for the variants

1570
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:34,960
when you're dealing with a genome that

1571
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,639
as polymorphic as cannabis

1572
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,079
all these tools were trained on humans

1573
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:39,358
so they're only expecting a variant

1574
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,400
every thousand letters when they start

1575
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:41,920
seeing whatever

1576
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,039
faces yeah they start throwing

1577
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,880
everything out saying this is a

1578
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,558
different organism get hell out of here

1579
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,240
so you have to go back and retrain all

1580
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,000
the base callers and all the variant

1581
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,239
callers to start calling the variants

1582
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,719
more appropriately and they usually take

1583
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:55,679
the tools that are used for mosquitoes

1584
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:57,279
mosquitoes

1585
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:58,318
have a variant like every 20 bases

1586
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,640
they're probably one of the most

1587
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:02,558
polymorphic species out there

1588
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:04,480
and so the tools that they did on gambi

1589
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,800
they can anophelese gambi they can then

1590
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,119
kind of tune to be somewhere between

1591
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,920
you know humans and and anopheles and

1592
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,079
and uh

1593
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,358
and settle in on cannabis so we went

1594
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,839
through the effort of doing that type of

1595
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:15,358
training

1596
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:17,119
with the tools that we're using so we

1597
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:18,239
get the base calls really accurate

1598
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,000
and the assembly is very accurate and

1599
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:21,199
then once you have that sort of trio

1600
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,119
that reference set

1601
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:24,239
you can then confidently take illumina

1602
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,760
data

1603
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:27,759
and map it across all of those

1604
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,400
references and start asking questions

1605
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,079
like

1606
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,720
are there entire segments of the genome

1607
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,640
missing um what's the polymorphism rate

1608
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:37,358
in all the genes that are out there

1609
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:39,199
how many highly damaging variants do we

1610
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:41,358
have in a given cultivar

1611
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,960
um in other words gene like mutations

1612
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:44,799
that actually destroy genes

1613
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,960
how many of them there's like 2 000 of

1614
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,720
those in a given

1615
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,400
genome there's that many genes that get

1616
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:53,519
obliterated through

1617
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,800
polymorphisms once you also have these

1618
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:56,559
references

1619
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,280
the next thing you want to do to curate

1620
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:02,160
them is you go and sequence the rna

1621
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,079
off of as many tissues as you can and

1622
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:06,078
what that does is it tells you

1623
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,760
what genes are being turned on and where

1624
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,359
they are in the genome

1625
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,119
today we don't have great tools that can

1626
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:12,880
just scan a reference genome and say oh

1627
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,079
i can see where all the genes are just

1628
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,599
algorithmically

1629
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:18,160
they really want to see biological

1630
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,920
evidence of how those rnas are getting

1631
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:21,440
written off the genome so if the

1632
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,358
listeners aren't familiar with dna and

1633
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,760
rna the analogy you often hear

1634
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:26,719
is that dna is like information on hard

1635
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,720
drive

1636
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,239
and the rna is what's in your task

1637
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:31,919
manager which programs are actually

1638
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,558
getting executed off that hard drive

1639
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,440
not every cell in your in in the genome

1640
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,680
or in the

1641
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,880
the plant is going to be expressing all

1642
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:41,118
genes all the time

1643
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,358
right you know a trichome is going to be

1644
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,358
expressing a lot of thc synthase

1645
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,719
but it may not be expressing any of the

1646
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:48,558
root proteins that are right

1647
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,399
that are needed to interact with the

1648
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,960
mycorrhizals so

1649
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,559
you you do this to try and get as many

1650
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,358
pictures of what genes are on and which

1651
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,040
tissues

1652
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:58,639
this helps you annotate the genome so

1653
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,000
you know where all the genes are and i

1654
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:02,318
don't think we're done with that process

1655
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,519
yet we did this across five tissues

1656
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:08,159
uh we found about 27 000 genes in the

1657
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:09,199
female genome and about 32 000 genes in

1658
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,719
the male genome

1659
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:13,039
and those numbers are likely to increase

1660
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,519
over time as people survey more tissues

1661
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,679
and and do more sequencing

1662
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,119
one thing that is really um a bit of a

1663
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:20,719
breakthrough that's happened this year

1664
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,640
in the sequencing platforms is those

1665
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:25,039
same single molecule sequencers can now

1666
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:26,879
be deployed on rna molecules

1667
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:29,279
and in the past we didn't really have

1668
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,400
that we had these short read sequencers

1669
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,160
trying to ascertain where the rna is

1670
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,400
mapping to the genome and that's really

1671
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:38,000
hard to do because rna is kind of like a

1672
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,039
fragmented hard drive

1673
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,280
it never reads a gene from uh

1674
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,318
like a capital letter to a period as a

1675
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,559
perfect sentence

1676
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:49,440
now what tends to happen in the genome

1677
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,680
is your gene gets scattered across

1678
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,639
uh the genome in like ten different

1679
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,480
pieces

1680
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:57,118
uh almost like fragmented data on a hard

1681
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,800
drive and there are tools in the cell

1682
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,039
that when you make that rna transcript

1683
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,160
they go and splice out the regions that

1684
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:05,279
are the exons

1685
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:07,519
and make what's known as a transcript

1686
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,680
and it the process of excising those

1687
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:12,639
exons it can do in a combinatorial way

1688
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:14,799
so you can have uh any given gene

1689
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:16,159
through a process known as alternative

1690
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,079
splicing of that rna

1691
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,279
can make you know three to ten different

1692
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,839
proteins

1693
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,440
so the protein complexity is not a

1694
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,119
one-to-one correlation with the genes

1695
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,039
that are in the genome

1696
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,280
but having these sequencing reads that

1697
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:32,000
can read across the entire gene

1698
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,079
genes rna in one shot means you can

1699
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,119
accurately place all of those exons back

1700
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,720
into the genome

1701
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,240
wow we haven't had that in cannabis

1702
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:39,519
until until this year actually i think

1703
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:40,078
we were the first people to probably put

1704
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:43,039
out any

1705
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,480
pac-bio rna isoseq data that gave us

1706
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:47,679
really clean information

1707
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,199
on intron and exon boundaries um that's

1708
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:49,679
uh that's something that's really hard

1709
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,279
to do

1710
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:52,879
with short reads particularly in very

1711
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,200
polymorphic species

1712
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,000
um it's it's a bit of a challenge so we

1713
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:58,399
now have that

1714
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,480
that backbone inside that koji browser

1715
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,880
we can see where all the transcripts are

1716
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,960
in five different tissues uh and then we

1717
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,358
also started to play around

1718
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,639
with methylomes this is the epigenetic

1719
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:10,318
code and it's never been done in

1720
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:12,480
cannabis before

1721
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:16,400
it's very hard to do in cannabis because

1722
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:18,639
cannabis the genome is 63 percent at

1723
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,838
so there's there's four bases in can in

1724
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:22,078
in most genomes

1725
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,599
a t c and g and the human genome has

1726
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,519
roughly an equal amount of all four

1727
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,519
letters making it a fairly

1728
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:29,599
easier genome to work with but as the

1729
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:32,159
genomes skew their themselves

1730
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,359
more in the direction of one nucleotide

1731
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:34,719
pair or the other

1732
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:36,318
it's kind of like putting a jigsaw

1733
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:37,439
puzzle together where all the pieces are

1734
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:41,039
the same color

1735
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,639
and having less entropy and signature in

1736
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:44,719
each of the pieces and so you find

1737
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:46,318
yourself confused more often

1738
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:47,919
well when you want to do methylation

1739
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:49,519
analysis

1740
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,039
you have two choices you can use some of

1741
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:52,400
these single molecule sequencers but

1742
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:53,039
they're not good at doing it in plants

1743
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,559
because plants

1744
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:56,480
methylation patterns are far more

1745
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,400
complicated than microbial ones so

1746
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,079
you can hit microbial or maybe human

1747
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,240
methylation patterns with the single

1748
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,599
the single molecule sequencers today but

1749
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,838
they don't handle plants very well yet

1750
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,838
so we had to resort to a tool

1751
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:09,599
that's known as bisulfite sequencing

1752
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:10,960
this is something that will convert the

1753
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,599
dna

1754
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,838
if it's not methylated into it all the

1755
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,280
cytosines in the in the genome

1756
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:18,960
if they're not deflated they get

1757
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,040
converted into into a t

1758
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,159
into a different base and so by

1759
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:25,759
sequencing this

1760
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:28,879
before and after a conversion like this

1761
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:32,319
you can figure out all the all the same

1762
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:35,519
protected deflation mark however

1763
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:38,798
the genome goes into something like 88

1764
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,960
uh at it becomes so at rich

1765
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:42,400
that you can really you lost trying to

1766
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,079
put the reeds back into the genome you

1767
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,039
only like map half of the genome back

1768
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,640
with this tool

1769
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,719
but it's the only thing we've got today

1770
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:50,318
uh to handle methylation and so we we

1771
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,598
ran that on four different tissues to

1772
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:52,880
get an understanding of

1773
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,200
where all the promoters are in the

1774
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,559
genome the promoters are the regions in

1775
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:58,558
front of the genes

1776
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,079
that are usually responsible for turning

1777
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,839
the gene on or off right and when

1778
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,480
they're methylated they're silencing the

1779
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:04,838
gene

1780
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,240
and when they're unmethylated or

1781
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:08,639
hypomethylated

1782
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:10,479
they're turning the gene on and so we've

1783
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:11,598
got beautiful pictures now of thc

1784
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,760
synthase and

1785
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,200
the adestine gene which is involved in

1786
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,640
some seed development

1787
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,199
those methylation patterns getting

1788
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:21,358
turned on and off dna

1789
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:23,439
um one reason why we're excited about

1790
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:25,279
this is it does give you

1791
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,639
it gives you better paleogenomic tools

1792
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,920
if you ever want to look at ancient

1793
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:29,920
cannabis samples

1794
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,519
you can't do it with rna rna is one of

1795
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,798
these molecules that breaks down really

1796
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:35,838
readily and very quickly

1797
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:37,440
it's it's that way on purpose because

1798
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:38,639
it needs to make those rnas to send a

1799
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,240
signal and it needs to kill those

1800
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,078
programs afterwards and so

1801
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:44,239
there's all this feedback mechanisms and

1802
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,519
cells to destroy rna after it's been

1803
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,358
expressed

1804
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:49,039
methylation however sticks around for a

1805
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:50,318
really long time you can actually pick

1806
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:53,440
up methylation signals on

1807
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:54,798
ancient dna samples and

1808
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,880
so it can give you some understanding of

1809
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:59,759
what genes are turned on and off

1810
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,039
uh across long time horizons uh and so

1811
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,400
there's um

1812
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:04,079
there's an interesting aspect to

1813
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,760
methylation data in that regard

1814
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,440
but um but that information is now

1815
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,559
together in public and people can kind

1816
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,358
of comb through it

1817
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,240
um that was leading to your i think your

1818
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:14,880
final question

1819
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:15,439
which is what do we see in this data

1820
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,880
regarding

1821
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:22,480
pathogen response right and

1822
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,760
the pathogen response front uh we

1823
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,639
we took a little bit of a myopic

1824
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,359
approach in that we we looked at all the

1825
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:31,358
genes that have been published in hops

1826
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:32,798
that play a role in pathogen response

1827
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:33,679
particularly powdery mildew resistance

1828
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:35,838
because

1829
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:37,440
powdery mildew is a type of pathogen

1830
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:39,759
that's very cheap to detect

1831
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,280
um there's not only pcr assays for it

1832
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,960
you can visually see it so

1833
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,040
you can tell if a powdery mildew

1834
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,559
resistant or not uh if it's surrounded

1835
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:48,239
by other plants that are loaded with it

1836
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,680
and it seems to not have it

1837
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:51,279
um that's not the case with a lot of

1838
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:53,519
other pathogens you can't see them so

1839
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:56,400
it's hard to to phenotype them

1840
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:58,079
but we so we looked at kitinases

1841
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,400
kitinases are enzymes that are

1842
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:02,640
throughout the kingdom the plant kingdom

1843
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,960
you see them in all plants um and you

1844
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:07,440
also even see them in fungi

1845
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,519
yeah yeah so it's an interesting game

1846
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,639
they some fungi express these to kill

1847
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:13,358
other fungi

1848
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:14,879
a one that makes kitinases to kill

1849
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:17,920
aspergillus so

1850
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,640
um it's uh it's a weapon that's used to

1851
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,599
fight off

1852
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:22,239
fungi because the cell coats and fungi

1853
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,160
are

1854
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:26,078
made of chitin and another molecule

1855
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:29,199
known as a beta-glucan

1856
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:30,640
and beta-glucan is something plants have

1857
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:32,719
evolved to fight as well

1858
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:34,960
with proteins known as thomatin-like

1859
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:37,039
proteins these things chew the other

1860
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,639
thing that's inside of a fungal cell

1861
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:41,358
membrane

1862
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,719
so we looked at those two gene classes

1863
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:46,318
and then another one known as

1864
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:48,000
mlo which is a mildew locus that was

1865
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:48,719
discovered or mildew resistance locus

1866
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,440
that was uh

1867
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:52,558
discovered in um in hops and in other

1868
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,000
other plants as well but there's some

1869
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,079
work done in hops trying to map this

1870
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,838
out so all in all that was about 82

1871
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:59,039
genes that we just went through and said

1872
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,199
are there any

1873
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,639
large like copy number changes in these

1874
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:04,558
genes that might correlate

1875
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,239
with pathogen response and we're

1876
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:07,680
starting to find some of those patterns

1877
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:10,318
in jamaica line

1878
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,759
there's a handful of thalmatine like

1879
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:12,880
proteins that have copy number

1880
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,720
amplifications

1881
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,240
that seem to correlate with path with

1882
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:17,838
powdery mildew resistance

1883
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:20,000
uh and there's some kitinases as well

1884
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:21,599
that are sticking out so

1885
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,838
those have been uh interesting to look

1886
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,920
at but um i i wouldn't say it's the

1887
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:27,519
final chapter on that story because i

1888
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,798
think we have found the genes

1889
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:30,400
responsible for powdery mildew

1890
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:32,159
resistance in jamaican lion

1891
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,318
but i don't think you can necessarily

1892
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:35,679
apply those to all the other plants out

1893
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:37,279
there because i think there's five to

1894
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,879
ten different modes of resistance out

1895
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,079
there and we just happen to be looking

1896
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,000
through the lens of one of them

1897
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,599
right right no that's a that's a really

1898
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,079
important point when

1899
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,640
when people read this data that it's

1900
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,318
it's

1901
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:50,639
very fascinating and it gives you

1902
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:53,440
insight into this one

1903
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:55,358
mode of action um but like we were

1904
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,039
referring to earlier there could be

1905
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:59,679
the picture is almost certainly more

1906
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:02,719
complex could be other things going on

1907
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:05,838
um that's that's super

1908
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:06,239
super fascinating i um there's a couple

1909
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:08,798
things

1910
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:10,479
that i wanted to ask you to define in

1911
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:11,920
case anybody's listening and has gotten

1912
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,519
a little confused

1913
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:18,559
um one is can you briefly describe

1914
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:18,880
simply what methylation is to listeners

1915
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,640
which

1916
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,559
normally my exposure to it is around

1917
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:23,920
like heavy metal resistance and plants

1918
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,160
and that sort of thing

1919
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,838
um but yeah just briefly describe um

1920
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:29,118
what that is put that in context for

1921
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:31,679
listening yeah so

1922
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:33,760
the atcs and g's in the genome

1923
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:34,480
faithfully replicate themselves in cell

1924
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,839
division

1925
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,838
but there are other marks almost

1926
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:40,880
environmental memories that get written

1927
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:42,318
onto the dna

1928
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,760
and they get written under the dna in

1929
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:47,279
the form of methylation they tend to

1930
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:49,040
methylate cytosines seeds in particular

1931
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,559
there is some methyl a that you see in

1932
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:52,960
bacteria but

1933
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,760
the most common methylation pattern you

1934
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,440
see

1935
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,799
is uh is a methylation signal that gets

1936
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,440
put in cytosine now there's a couple

1937
00:59:56,798 --> 00:59:59,599
other

1938
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,798
forms of methylation on cytosine that i

1939
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,440
won't get into but in

1940
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:04,079
in neurons and humans there's

1941
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,599
5-hydroxymethylation and there's a

1942
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,119
variety of other forms of methylation

1943
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,280
but it's still all working on

1944
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,039
the cytosine base just different methyl

1945
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,839
groups hanging off of it

1946
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:15,358
but this is usually something that's

1947
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:17,599
done uh to make the dna coil

1948
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:18,639
and to contract it's uh when you add a

1949
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:22,079
methyl group it makes it

1950
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:24,000
a more hydrophobic um

1951
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,079
molecule it's like adding more carbon to

1952
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,318
it makes it greasier and so

1953
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:29,920
the dna changes properties and the

1954
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:31,679
methylation tends to also attract other

1955
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,200
histones and other proteins to it to

1956
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:34,798
wrap the dna and coil it

1957
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:36,399
and a lot of gene expression is based on

1958
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:37,838
just uncoiling the dna

1959
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,079
getting these histones to move out of

1960
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:42,078
the way getting the dna to relax so that

1961
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,280
an rna polymerase can come in and start

1962
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,960
to express a gene

1963
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,559
so you tend to find the regions of the

1964
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,960
genome that are getting silenced

1965
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,000
get get heavily methylated the cytosines

1966
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,679
get methylated

1967
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,280
uh and then when they're getting

1968
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:54,719
expressed they tend to erase that

1969
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,599
methylation pattern

1970
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:58,719
now sometimes in rare cases this

1971
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,760
methylation

1972
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,879
is is accidentally heritable it gets it

1973
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,839
gets moved through

1974
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,280
sperm and meiosis and into they've shown

1975
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:09,440
in rats and mice that they

1976
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,119
there can be methylation signals and

1977
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,519
small rna molecules

1978
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,640
that transfer environmental information

1979
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:16,880
into the offspring

1980
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:18,480
it's a very very subtle effect it's you

1981
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,400
need very large n numbers to really

1982
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,079
prove this and it's probably a minority

1983
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,880
of the heritability that's going on in

1984
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,880
genetics

1985
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,559
but it's fascinating yeah it's it's it's

1986
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,519
one of these it's one of these things

1987
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,559
that's brought back

1988
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:31,199
the debate between uh you know darwin

1989
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:34,480
and lamar

1990
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:35,439
you know darwinian genetics versus

1991
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,599
nurture

1992
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,200
exactly it's it's it's back and it's

1993
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,200
it's good that it is back it's been a

1994
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:43,199
long time lamarck has silenced for

1995
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:44,798
many years but the reality is a little

1996
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:47,199
bit of lamarck was right

1997
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:48,000
uh and that there are aspects of your

1998
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:50,480
environment

1999
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,480
that will get written onto your dna and

2000
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,318
a small portion of that may in fact find

2001
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,920
its way into the offspring such that the

2002
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:58,318
environment can actually change the

2003
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,280
genetic outcome in

2004
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,960
future generations but um again that's

2005
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,280
it's a very subtle effect

2006
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,720
and and not nearly as powerful as the

2007
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,000
mutations you might see that are

2008
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:11,759
actually written faithfully

2009
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:14,079
into dna yeah the thing that pops up in

2010
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,079
my mind to conceptualize this

2011
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:17,680
in a totally different way my wife is a

2012
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,798
mental health therapist it reminds me of

2013
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:21,759
the concept of

2014
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:22,079
intergenerational trauma it's like you

2015
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,280
know

2016
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:28,559
right these subtle things that can

2017
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:31,680
you know get passed on um that relate to

2018
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:33,039
to how you know somebody uh grew up and

2019
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,199
and their environment and everything

2020
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:37,039
but it's interesting and i know we're

2021
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:38,719
deviating but i think

2022
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:41,280
this is something in general i wanted to

2023
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:44,000
ask you about misconceptions around

2024
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,839
genetics and and genomics and stuff so

2025
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,639
the concept of epigenetics is talked

2026
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:51,679
about a lot it's a very um

2027
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:54,558
it's a big sort of buzzword in

2028
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:56,399
pop popular science pop culture science

2029
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,160
and stuff like that and so i

2030
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,079
one of the questions i was going to ask

2031
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:02,318
i may just ask you now what are

2032
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,640
some of the misconceptions that you hear

2033
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:06,719
kind of popularly shared about

2034
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:08,400
genetics genomics and and particularly

2035
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:10,879
epigenetics whether it be

2036
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,200
related to plants or humans um that

2037
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,960
you'd kind of like to set straight

2038
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:16,558
so the scientific field is really

2039
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,159
excited about methylation for the

2040
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,240
complete opposite reasons that pop

2041
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:23,440
culture likes to magnify its effect

2042
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:25,519
um the the pop culture likes to uh

2043
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,119
almost guilt people into their actions

2044
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:29,759
today are gonna hurt some child three

2045
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:31,760
generations from now and that is

2046
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,039
remote garbage it's it's it's hard to

2047
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:36,160
hang out on but

2048
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,440
um the uh but we're excited about it

2049
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:38,558
because it teaches us about the

2050
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,760
machinery of

2051
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,240
of expression and and the cell when we

2052
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,480
see

2053
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:45,279
the cell methylating certain things it

2054
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,559
tells us

2055
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,720
it gives us another vantage point on

2056
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,559
what's going on um it's one thing just

2057
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:51,598
to measure the rna that's coming off of

2058
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:53,440
these

2059
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:55,440
off the genome it's entirely another

2060
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,119
thing to have and to know

2061
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,400
which parts of the genome is methylating

2062
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,000
as a result of this because that implies

2063
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,318
there's a feedback mechanism that there

2064
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,480
is

2065
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:03,920
something else in the cell that is

2066
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,679
responding to a signal

2067
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,079
to make something transcribe and maybe

2068
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:10,078
even a feedback mechanism turn it off

2069
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,760
uh and so we like having those circuits

2070
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,599
all spelled out so we're really excited

2071
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,079
about epigenetics for that reason

2072
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:18,559
but a lot of that often gets um uh

2073
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:20,880
pushed into pop culture as being

2074
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,920
uh you know this your actions from three

2075
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,318
generations ago

2076
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,440
are now impacting uh the direction of

2077
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:28,480
the human population

2078
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,159
and uh that that's the there's very

2079
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,760
very very thin evidence for those things

2080
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:33,759
i don't doubt that that some of those

2081
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:36,000
studies are in fact real but the ireland

2082
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,400
famine is one that comes to mind but

2083
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,199
it's such a weak p-value and such a weak

2084
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,280
effect

2085
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:42,399
that um you'd be better off worrying

2086
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,240
about whether you're

2087
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,920
you're staring at your phone too long

2088
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:48,719
walking into a street i mean

2089
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,240
yeah yeah really yeah well there's

2090
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:51,598
there's stronger selective pressures out

2091
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:53,439
there that are likely to

2092
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:56,400
affect your genetics than than some of

2093
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,639
those um those epigenetic effects so

2094
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,079
uh it's unfortunate but it happens you

2095
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:02,239
know that the science often

2096
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,000
gets interpreted politically and i think

2097
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:07,118
uh epigenetics is one that

2098
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,079
that has uh a sort of guilt associated

2099
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:10,720
with it that's being

2100
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:12,640
leveraged politically well yeah and for

2101
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:16,159
people that are not scientists

2102
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:17,679
or have a very vague understanding of

2103
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:19,118
the research that's gone into this it

2104
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:20,639
can really freak people out

2105
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:23,039
unnecessarily it can cause a lot of

2106
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:25,358
stress like you like you mentioned

2107
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:26,960
um that that really isn't warranted and

2108
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:30,078
another example that comes to mind

2109
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:32,480
is you know concern over um you know

2110
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:33,920
different types of waves that are

2111
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:37,280
passing through your body

2112
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:38,798
you know um and the effects of

2113
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,519
gravitational waves and this sort of

2114
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:42,719
stuff that

2115
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:43,679
some people um when they start hearing

2116
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:46,798
about

2117
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:47,679
um oh gosh like quantum quantum gravity

2118
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:49,519
and

2119
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:51,838
uh quantum mechanics is a big one where

2120
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:53,599
people start to hear these concepts and

2121
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:54,639
then they get really strung out worrying

2122
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:57,519
about

2123
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:59,279
um these effects of things that you know

2124
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:02,400
the effects may be real but they're so

2125
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,359
small in comparison to other things that

2126
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,880
have much

2127
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:06,960
bigger pressures on you like you're

2128
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,559
saying that it's like it's not really

2129
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,760
worth exerting the mental energy to

2130
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,079
worry about that when

2131
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,440
you're already here you have much more

2132
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,440
real um

2133
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,200
issues to deal with that you probably

2134
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:20,318
don't have to worry about

2135
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:22,000
um you know wave just

2136
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:24,400
gravitational wave distortions being

2137
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,358
caused by you know comets and things

2138
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,838
moving through

2139
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:28,880
you know the galaxy uh strong that is a

2140
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:32,880
great way to describe

2141
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:36,000
string theory yeah

2142
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,200
so so go and going back to the the

2143
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,440
research study now

2144
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:40,719
so well i guess one thing i want to

2145
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,240
summarize for listeners too

2146
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:43,199
just to kind of talk about some of the

2147
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:44,558
techniques and the things you've

2148
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:49,118
described so we

2149
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:52,880
we talked about basic um dna sequencing

2150
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:53,760
and that is looking at the possibilities

2151
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,000
essentially

2152
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,000
of the organism what's what's there the

2153
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,679
foundation to work from

2154
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,358
measuring the rna allows you to

2155
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:04,639
understand

2156
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:06,480
what's actually at play um within that

2157
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:08,400
dna sequence and then the methylation

2158
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,798
piece being able to look at that

2159
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,000
helps you understand how the environment

2160
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:14,000
is influencing

2161
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,920
these things that are at play is that a

2162
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,280
a good super simplified version of

2163
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,358
explaining that

2164
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,119
you know methylation in many ways is i

2165
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:22,078
actually like the rna data better

2166
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:23,680
because there's

2167
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,920
so much more information content there

2168
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:27,519
and it's it's more accurately mapped

2169
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,760
but the methylation is kind of another

2170
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:32,318
confirmation yeah when you see

2171
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,240
uh promoters uh have methylation

2172
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:35,119
patterns that promote the expression of

2173
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:37,519
the genes you

2174
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:38,960
um you have more confidence in actually

2175
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:40,798
what's going on so it's just another

2176
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,798
it's another view under the genome

2177
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:44,719
um but yeah that's that's effectively

2178
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:46,318
the central dogma right as we have this

2179
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:48,000
genome it is

2180
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:49,679
the hand that you're dealt and if you

2181
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,798
don't have certain aces in that deck

2182
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:52,399
you're never going to get them no matter

2183
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:53,920
how much light or water you

2184
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,760
plant so if you don't have a thc

2185
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,200
synthase gene you're not going to coach

2186
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,520
that plant into making thc

2187
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:01,279
some other way yeah um however if you do

2188
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:02,719
have a thc synthase gene if the gene

2189
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,839
doesn't necessarily predict that you're

2190
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:06,078
going to make

2191
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:07,038
seven percent versus 14 percent thc

2192
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,039
right

2193
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,319
at least that gene doesn't we're hunting

2194
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:12,319
down a couple other genes

2195
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:13,599
that are related to the precursors in

2196
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:14,480
the pathway that might in fact have a

2197
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:16,798
bigger impact

2198
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,960
on the magnitude of expression but right

2199
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:20,560
now the genetics between thc and cbd

2200
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,520
they really just give you the ratio yeah

2201
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,279
to expect

2202
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,520
but they're not going to give you uh if

2203
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,759
you push the magnitude of expression

2204
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,880
of a given ratio too far it will break

2205
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,798
the the usda

2206
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,239
regulations and genetics today aren't

2207
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:34,560
going to predict that

2208
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:35,678
um i think in a couple years we'll know

2209
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,279
that we'll know that there's a couple

2210
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,960
genes

2211
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:41,920
stream that everyone's looking at um

2212
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:44,798
that are involved an aa3 and aa1 and

2213
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,600
um there's a libertolic acid cyclase and

2214
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:47,198
transfer

2215
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,120
all of those things are great candidates

2216
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:51,039
for mutations that may in fact

2217
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:52,559
be driving the magnitude of expression

2218
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:53,439
between a seven percent and a fourteen

2219
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,880
percenter but

2220
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:56,559
you know if you have a fourteen percent

2221
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,159
cbd line uh

2222
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,159
you're going to be risking that popping

2223
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:01,759
hot um it's gonna it's gonna probably

2224
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:03,119
approach that point three percent

2225
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:04,880
under the given regs that are there and

2226
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:07,198
so a lot of people are unfortunately

2227
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,039
trying to find seven percent lines grow

2228
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:11,039
twice as much material

2229
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:12,640
only so the material 99 percent of it

2230
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,838
ends up going into an extractor

2231
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:17,520
ratio no longer it's absolute entity by

2232
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:20,318
regulation but

2233
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,319
it's what's there but to the point of

2234
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:24,640
your analogy on cards um you know if

2235
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:25,759
you're missing both aces cbd and thc

2236
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,838
you're going to be you're going to be

2237
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:28,319
making the precursors the kings if you

2238
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:31,359
will

2239
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,798
and uh and that's uh so the genetics can

2240
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:35,279
be very very predictive and they can be

2241
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:37,600
predictive at a very early age

2242
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:39,040
and they can also scale that's one thing

2243
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,239
that i don't think everyone yet

2244
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:41,359
appreciates while

2245
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:43,039
they probably are never going to give

2246
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:45,920
you and never going to be a replacement

2247
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:47,198
for an hplc value

2248
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,359
you're probably never going to have a

2249
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:50,798
field portable hplc that can run

2250
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:53,039
thousands of samples a second

2251
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:54,960
yeah yeah that will be doable with

2252
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:58,800
genetics it's just a matter of time

2253
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:00,880
um but it it it's much harder to imagine

2254
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,079
getting that to work with an hplc system

2255
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,960
that's field portable

2256
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:06,559
so so they're complementary and we

2257
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,039
always encourage people not to view them

2258
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,560
as one versus the other because

2259
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:12,640
there are many more things that you can

2260
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,159
measure with genomics and its price

2261
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,679
points are changing so radically you

2262
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:16,000
should pay attention to it but they're

2263
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,440
always

2264
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,198
going to be complemented by people who

2265
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:21,198
have good analytical testing equipment

2266
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:22,719
yeah and i think that's a an excellent

2267
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:24,639
way to summarize that it is all

2268
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,560
complementary and even within analytical

2269
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:29,679
chemistry there's

2270
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:33,120
sometimes a a strange um

2271
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:35,199
competition between analysts that prefer

2272
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:37,039
um kind of traditional chromatography

2273
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:38,319
and those that like to rely on mass

2274
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:40,960
spectrometry and

2275
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:42,000
you've got some people that are very

2276
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,760
resistant to

2277
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,198
you know they kind of want to stick to

2278
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,719
chromatography and you know and that's

2279
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:47,519
what they do and others like really

2280
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:50,158
trust

2281
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,199
um spectrometry and and then i mean

2282
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:54,238
obviously

2283
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:55,039
i mean they blend together you use mass

2284
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:57,919
spectrometry

2285
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:58,399
as yeah exactly um but there is a funny

2286
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,000
there's

2287
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:02,000
you know within the science world there

2288
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,198
are these weird little camps and tribes

2289
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,039
just like anywhere else

2290
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:06,799
where yeah yeah and they exist in

2291
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:08,000
convincing too we all bicker over what's

2292
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,520
the better platform to use

2293
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:14,880
right yeah yeah um are there

2294
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:16,719
any other lessons that um

2295
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,560
that you gleaned from this recent

2296
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:19,679
research project that you want to talk

2297
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,120
about i mean one thing we

2298
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,520
mentioned but i don't know if we really

2299
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:26,800
got into it was the relationship between

2300
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:29,360
these um cannabinoid acid synthase genes

2301
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,800
and the pathogen resistance we touched

2302
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:32,399
on it early on but i don't know if we

2303
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:36,079
really got into it

2304
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:36,960
yeah so um the ongoing debate in the

2305
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:39,519
field is

2306
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,960
what is responsible for residual thc

2307
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,159
expression in plants that don't have a

2308
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,640
thc synthase gene

2309
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:45,759
yeah why are why are hemp plants popping

2310
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,039
hot

2311
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,679
and the number one culprit for that is

2312
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:51,119
cbd synthase um whenever people clone

2313
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:53,039
that into yeast and and

2314
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:56,158
run it they tend to get like 20 to 1 23

2315
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:59,359
to one ratios of of cbd hd so the gene

2316
01:11:56,158 --> 01:12:01,839
in yeast will make promiscuous thc

2317
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:03,198
um you can alter the ph of those of

2318
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,600
those conditions and

2319
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:06,479
even get those genes to make all the

2320
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,480
other command points

2321
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:10,238
yeah um in fact there's a there's a

2322
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:11,039
really good presentation i'd recommend

2323
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:12,879
people look at

2324
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:14,319
um it's a can med presentation from this

2325
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,560
october from andrew horowitz from

2326
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:19,119
dimitrix demetrix is a synthetic biology

2327
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:21,199
company out of jay keisling's laboratory

2328
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:22,880
and uh jay keising is well known for

2329
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:25,839
cloning a lot of the plant genes

2330
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,119
into bacteria and and into yeast this

2331
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,560
freaks a lot of people out but there's

2332
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:29,198
actually really good science that you

2333
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,120
learn

2334
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:32,238
when you isolate a gene into a model

2335
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:34,079
organism like that

2336
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:35,678
because you can perturb it in isolation

2337
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:37,279
of all the other cannabinoid genes that

2338
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,520
are in the cannabis genome you take

2339
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:41,599
one of them out and put it into yeast

2340
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,000
and then you can play with the ph and

2341
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,520
and

2342
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,279
you can play with temperature and all

2343
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,360
these other conditions feed it different

2344
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:49,119
precursors and see what happens

2345
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:52,319
and what they did is they fed those

2346
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:55,920
yeast hexanoic acid and they got thcp

2347
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:58,479
so they actually found thcp before

2348
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,760
we found it in the plants yeah the

2349
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:01,439
italians discovered it

2350
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,640
very recently but if you actually go

2351
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:04,238
through the literature realize no they

2352
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,480
were making this in yeast

2353
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:07,678
and they learned that the synthase genes

2354
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:09,519
in cannabis

2355
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:11,920
that we currently have if you feed it

2356
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,920
octanoic acid will make thcp

2357
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,520
so we don't need to go be looking for a

2358
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:19,679
different thc gene it's

2359
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:21,679
the same gene will fold thcv and thcp

2360
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:23,440
we need to be looking upstream maybe in

2361
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:25,520
the pathway that's that's governing

2362
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:27,039
what makes hexanoic acid and what makes

2363
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,560
oxynoid gas

2364
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,560
so we're beginning to be able to use

2365
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,760
synthetic biology to teach us about the

2366
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:34,159
plant

2367
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,760
we did a very similar thing in in this

2368
01:13:34,158 --> 01:13:36,559
study in that we took a couple of the

2369
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,239
genes

2370
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,000
that we saw were related to pathogen

2371
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:42,479
response and we cloned them

2372
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,840
into e coli we took a thalma team like

2373
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:46,319
protein

2374
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:48,640
that was amplified in the jamaican lion

2375
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:50,399
genome and also amplified in a couple

2376
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,280
samples that we got from colorado seeds

2377
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:55,198
and from minibus

2378
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:58,079
mark jordan's group and those ones

2379
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:59,759
we put into into e coli and once we had

2380
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:01,198
excuse me that cannabis gene getting

2381
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:04,000
synthesized in a coli

2382
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:04,399
we can make gobs of it and then apply it

2383
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,880
back

2384
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:09,839
to microbes that we know infect cannabis

2385
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:12,079
like fusarium and aspergillus

2386
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,719
and see if that peptide actually kills

2387
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:16,000
those microbes at least in a petri dish

2388
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:17,679
and we demonstrate some of this in the

2389
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,279
paper it's not killing uh we don't have

2390
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:20,399
evidence that that the tlps the

2391
01:14:19,279 --> 01:14:22,880
thumbnail like proteins are

2392
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:24,238
are killing aspergillus but we do see

2393
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,400
that it's retarding the growth of

2394
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:27,759
penicillium species and of pusarium

2395
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:29,519
oxysporum

2396
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,520
the next experiment we have running is

2397
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,199
grabbing the other gene we found

2398
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,560
that was correlated with this resistance

2399
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:35,919
which is a kitenase

2400
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,600
uh we have that getting cloned and

2401
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,279
expressed nikoi as well and

2402
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,840
most of the plant literature shows that

2403
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:42,880
if you combine these two you get a

2404
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,840
better a one plus one equals three

2405
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,760
effect

2406
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,360
and uh you really can knock down um the

2407
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,280
microbes once you have both of them

2408
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:50,639
present so we're in the process now of

2409
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:52,719
taking those cannabis genes and just

2410
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,039
making gobs of that protein

2411
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:56,960
so we can test out the theory is are

2412
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:58,399
these the proteins that are responsible

2413
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,840
for keeping cannabis powdery

2414
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:01,439
are they some of the proteins i should

2415
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,880
say not the only ones that are making

2416
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:04,479
cannabis pottery milk resistant

2417
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,400
and can we consider those as like a

2418
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:08,158
foliar spray um

2419
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:09,599
there's it's it's one thing to have the

2420
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:11,119
genetics and know how to breed for

2421
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,400
resistance with this particular form of

2422
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:13,439
resistance that's very helpful but it

2423
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:14,879
might take time

2424
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:16,319
but there are some jurisdictions

2425
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,480
particularly here in massachusetts where

2426
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:19,599
changing your genetics isn't easy

2427
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:21,119
you have to kind of run with the

2428
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,679
genetics you put into the seed to cell

2429
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:24,640
tracking system and if you want to add

2430
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:27,039
you've got to go through a lot of

2431
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,840
paperwork with the ccc and it's a big

2432
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:29,119
hassle

2433
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,039
so some people are kind of locked and

2434
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:32,399
loaded with the mothers they have and

2435
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:35,198
they're looking for

2436
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:36,879
ways to fight off these pathogens with

2437
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:38,479
native peptides from the cannabis plant

2438
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,520
not with some foreign molecule that's

2439
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:42,238
going to end up in a vape

2440
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,760
yeah and so we're really excited about

2441
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:45,279
that side of the market because we like

2442
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,760
the idea of enzymatic

2443
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:48,399
pesticides because enzymes degrade yeah

2444
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,320
exactly

2445
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:51,679
and you can you can destroy them and you

2446
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:53,198
can get rid of them so you can use them

2447
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,399
in a really ephemeral nature

2448
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:56,238
and they're not going to end up like

2449
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:57,439
microbutanol concentrating into your

2450
01:15:56,238 --> 01:15:59,359
vape cartridge

2451
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:00,719
um and we'd rather do this with peptides

2452
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:01,920
that we know are from the cannabis plant

2453
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,960
because the consumers are already

2454
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,840
consuming those

2455
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,000
exactly you don't want to grab something

2456
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,600
foreign that might trigger an allergic

2457
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,560
reaction we want to grab something that

2458
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,400
has been

2459
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,000
time tested with human biology for

2460
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,359
thousands of years and

2461
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,359
if it's come out of cannabis it's

2462
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:17,599
probably been through that ringer before

2463
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:19,759
yeah that's that's super exciting using

2464
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,840
using these technologies to think about

2465
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,920
different types of pest management and

2466
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,840
something that came into my mind

2467
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:28,158
then too is you know we've we've been

2468
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:30,800
talking about pathogens

2469
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:30,799
but what about

2470
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:37,359
genes related in some form or another

2471
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:38,719
to beneficial relationships that the

2472
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:41,839
plant would have

2473
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:43,760
with microorganisms so the thing that

2474
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:46,079
that kind of shocked us that came out of

2475
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,199
the paper was if you look at the rna

2476
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:50,158
expression

2477
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:53,678
in the plant the most heavily expressed

2478
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:55,920
genes in the genome are these kite bases

2479
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:57,600
however and they're also the most

2480
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,239
differentially expressed genes meaning

2481
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,960
that the

2482
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:02,000
the different rna the rna expression is

2483
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,640
quite divergent between

2484
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,238
tissues but it's completely absent in

2485
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,000
the roots

2486
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:09,439
and i think the same was similar with

2487
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,479
the tlp so

2488
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:14,399
um why is it not expressing

2489
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:15,599
pathogen response to the roots well we

2490
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:17,039
think that's due to

2491
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,480
a lot of the work people have just

2492
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:20,079
demonstrated before us but these

2493
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:21,359
mycorrhizal interactions you might have

2494
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:23,519
in the root systems if you want to

2495
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:25,519
foster mycorrhizal interactions

2496
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,840
you you don't start off that handshake

2497
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:30,080
with a toxic kite

2498
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,679
right yeah come on in and let me kill

2499
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:33,519
you while you're at it

2500
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,800
yeah so that's kind of fascinating

2501
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,320
because the roots are not making this

2502
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,320
stuff uh and that's probably to have

2503
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:40,960
some type of commensal react you know

2504
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:43,039
relationship with the with um the fungi

2505
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,079
they're in the soil

2506
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:45,760
the other thing that was kind of

2507
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:48,238
interesting along those lines is that

2508
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:50,159
that deletion that um

2509
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:51,599
we see so commonly in the type one

2510
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:52,559
plants which is a canava chroming

2511
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,400
deletion

2512
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,000
uh it's quite present in a lot of the

2513
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:58,960
hemp lines and

2514
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,479
many of the the hemp growers are looking

2515
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,600
they're working in breeding programs to

2516
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:04,000
cross

2517
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,520
and and capture that cannabi chromium

2518
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
deletion into their hemp line so they

2519
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,520
can just

2520
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,600
we think that's what's responsible for

2521
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,480
the thc levels that you see in type 4

2522
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,079
plants

2523
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:14,158
you'll see some type 4 plants out there

2524
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:16,559
that are like a hundred to one

2525
01:18:14,158 --> 01:18:18,079
and uh they don't have thc or cbd

2526
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,679
synthase so the only the most likely

2527
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:20,640
place that that residual thc is coming

2528
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:21,920
from is probably they can have a

2529
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,440
chromium cluster and so people are

2530
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,960
looking to just try and get rid of that

2531
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:26,479
yeah particularly if it's already known

2532
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,960
to exist in the population we can just

2533
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:31,119
do a couple crosses and get there

2534
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,719
but in the process of doing that we have

2535
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:34,238
to pay close attention to those other

2536
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:35,920
four genes that are on that that

2537
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:38,799
deletion that are involved

2538
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,520
in pathogen response because that may

2539
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,440
alter

2540
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,360
you may breed yourself of a really

2541
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:45,198
compliant hemp line that is loaded with

2542
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:46,719
patriarchs and powdery mildew

2543
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:48,079
um and and that's a little bit more

2544
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:49,920
frightening to us actually because the

2545
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:51,119
usda has nothing in the regs for

2546
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,279
microbial detection

2547
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:54,158
no no you can have it loaded with

2548
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:56,559
aspergillus

2549
01:18:54,158 --> 01:18:57,599
and uh and as long as it's below 0.3

2550
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,280
it's cool

2551
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,039
uh and that's a bit of a bummer for

2552
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:02,639
those who are used looking at cbd flower

2553
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:04,238
for like a smoking

2554
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:07,199
program i mean there's a lot of success

2555
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:09,119
in people swapping out cbd for tobacco

2556
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:10,319
uh or swapping tobacco for cbd i think

2557
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:10,960
switzerland's been doing a lot of that

2558
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:13,279
work and

2559
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:15,198
yeah uh that's a much safer alternative

2560
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:17,279
as donald tashkin's shown but

2561
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:18,319
um i don't know that i can say that if

2562
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:21,439
it's gonna be

2563
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:23,198
hemp that can be loaded so we need to do

2564
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:25,759
more work there that's still just a

2565
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:27,359
a theory that these genes are missing

2566
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,920
when you when you select for cannabi

2567
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:30,399
chromium

2568
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,079
deletions um there's a lot more work

2569
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:34,158
that needs to go into proving that those

2570
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:35,359
are in fact more pathogen susceptible we

2571
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:37,279
haven't done that work which

2572
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:38,799
just kind of pointed out the fact that

2573
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:40,158
it's a common deletion people are

2574
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,440
probably going to breed for it and it's

2575
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:42,158
going to come with these genes getting

2576
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:44,319
knocked out

2577
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:46,000
but one of those four genes is a gene

2578
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:49,679
that's involved in viral

2579
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,079
response and viruses we know are we're

2580
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,840
now

2581
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:53,679
starting to be able to detect those uh

2582
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,360
with the rna sequencing data that's

2583
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:56,800
not a lot of the laboratories and and

2584
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:58,238
the discovery phase

2585
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:00,239
of cannabis viruses is really just

2586
01:19:58,238 --> 01:20:01,279
beginning um there's there's only a few

2587
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:02,639
that have been that have been really

2588
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:04,158
quantitatively nailed

2589
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,760
but i think we're going to see 10 more

2590
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:08,158
in the next two years

2591
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,320
uh and and that's going to change um you

2592
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:12,799
know how we manage those as well

2593
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:14,319
yeah i feel like i keep seeing um like

2594
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,480
every year

2595
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:18,238
since i don't know one or two years ago

2596
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:20,000
i'm starting to see

2597
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:22,000
uh or people are messaging me saying

2598
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,960
have you heard of this virus that's been

2599
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
identified

2600
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:27,279
and sometimes these viruses have very um

2601
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,119
cryptic names because they don't have a

2602
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:33,840
name it's um like

2603
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:33,840
i can't remember the name of one

2604
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:38,158
yeah it is yeah exactly yeah those are

2605
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:40,000
in ncbi and i can't

2606
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:42,158
i don't know we made assets for those

2607
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,359
we've never found them in cannabis

2608
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:47,198
uh and it's probably just it's very rare

2609
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:48,399
the challenge with our with the viruses

2610
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:50,559
is that uh

2611
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:51,679
they're usually rna-based sometimes they

2612
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,280
they're vibroids and they don't even

2613
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:55,359
have a protein shell on them so they're

2614
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:56,800
very susceptible to breakdown

2615
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:58,559
which means it's unlikely they're going

2616
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:01,119
to make it to your laboratory intact

2617
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:02,400
um yeah across state lines and very few

2618
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:03,679
people want to hang out for that

2619
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,960
experiment that you know you

2620
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:06,560
they think they have a virus they torch

2621
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,480
it they don't yeah and let's put it over

2622
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,880
here so you can play with it

2623
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:12,559
it's it's uh it's it's a bit to ask

2624
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:15,359
saying hey can you save that one for me

2625
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,560
and ship it across state lines um so

2626
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:18,399
what usually means is you've got to

2627
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,360
teach people how to do rna extractions

2628
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:20,799
in the field

2629
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:22,960
so that you can get something that's

2630
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,800
converted into dna or is in on

2631
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:27,119
ice and can survive the shipment to a

2632
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,639
laboratory and we're just not there yet

2633
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:29,519
as a community we're still getting some

2634
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,359
of those tools

2635
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,199
out to the masses so that people can do

2636
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:36,000
on-site rna preps but

2637
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:36,479
um the ones that are tightly linked to a

2638
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,399
you know

2639
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:39,759
close um university can probably get

2640
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:41,198
those those studies done and we're

2641
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,960
starting to see that

2642
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:45,198
i think darkheart nursery did some work

2643
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,960
uh looking up the uh

2644
01:21:45,198 --> 01:21:48,799
that was a viroid that was a hopslayton

2645
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,480
viroid but there was also some excellent

2646
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,639
work out of israel looking at a lettuce

2647
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:55,039
chlorosis virus

2648
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:56,560
excuse me that um that was they actually

2649
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:58,399
demonstrated white fly transmission in

2650
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,400
that paper

2651
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:02,399
so um the pest management is actually

2652
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:04,719
playing a role because some of these

2653
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:05,759
uh pets are they're actually the vectors

2654
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:08,079
for the disease

2655
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,760
um but we we've built uh quantitative

2656
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:11,679
pcr assays for

2657
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,800
all three of those for for cannabis

2658
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:15,920
cryptic virus

2659
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:17,600
hops um latent viroid orbits obsolete

2660
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,359
and thyroid and then lettuce sclerosis

2661
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,800
virus

2662
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:22,719
and we're just in the early stages of

2663
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,920
working with people to get them to test

2664
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:25,039
these out so if you know people out

2665
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,679
there that are interested in

2666
01:22:25,039 --> 01:22:30,158
quantitative pcr tests to monitor that

2667
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:31,840
um we have the tools we just don't have

2668
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:33,039
the grows or the gardens of the places

2669
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,000
to deploy them we need to partner with

2670
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:35,840
people to see

2671
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,359
exactly how to put those things to use

2672
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:39,199
yeah i think i think it was the hopslate

2673
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:42,799
and viroid that someone asked me about

2674
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:45,119
very recently um and i hadn't

2675
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,159
heard about that in the context of

2676
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:48,639
cannabis at all

2677
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:49,439
until they they mentioned it um one

2678
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:52,319
thing

2679
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:54,719
that i was wondering is is there any way

2680
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:58,238
to test a plant sort of generically

2681
01:22:54,719 --> 01:23:02,158
to understand if it

2682
01:22:58,238 --> 01:23:04,559
um is likely to have a virus regardless

2683
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:06,158
of identifying what that virus is

2684
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,639
because i know a lot of cultivators

2685
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:11,039
battle this you know sometimes viruses

2686
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:13,119
appear as like nutrient deficiencies of

2687
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:14,719
very similar symptoms and i

2688
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:16,880
have cultivators that ask me a lot how

2689
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:18,079
do i quickly know whether this is a

2690
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,600
nutrient problem

2691
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:23,760
or a viral problem so this is actually

2692
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:27,120
an industry-wide problem that's not

2693
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:30,239
unique um to cannabis viruses

2694
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:31,840
um they don't have necessarily conserved

2695
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:33,439
sequences that we can rely on to

2696
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,000
universally capture them and sequence

2697
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:36,079
them so

2698
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,600
yeah um if you look at fungi and

2699
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:38,479
bacteria there's tricks that you can

2700
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,560
play they yeah

2701
01:23:38,479 --> 01:23:42,399
they all have to have ribosomal dna

2702
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,280
operons right so you can design primers

2703
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:44,879
that will amplify

2704
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:46,559
all yeast and mold you can design

2705
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,960
primers i shouldn't say almost

2706
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:50,000
because there is there is even some

2707
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,679
divergence amongst

2708
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,840
um primer sites you might pick to try

2709
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:56,719
and amplify all of these things

2710
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:58,400
but um likewise with bacteria usually go

2711
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,560
after the 16s region and

2712
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:02,238
and that a single set of primers can

2713
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,840
probably get you everything in the

2714
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:05,678
bacterial side of things we don't have

2715
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:08,000
the the analogous um

2716
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:08,960
primer sequences you might target for

2717
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,319
viruses that

2718
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,198
would be conserved across all of them

2719
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:13,279
they're having this problem with

2720
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:16,399
coronaviruses right now but they have to

2721
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:17,759
engineer new assays for these viruses so

2722
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:20,079
they can spread them around the world

2723
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,360
and um the virus mutates a little bit so

2724
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:22,880
they have to have multiple different

2725
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:25,599
primer sites that target

2726
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,319
the coronavirus um so what people do in

2727
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,560
the case where

2728
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:30,238
they can't use something as fast as qpcr

2729
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,520
is they resort to rna sequencing which

2730
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:34,158
just captures

2731
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,520
all of the rna that's present uh

2732
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:37,359
sequences that

2733
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,719
sometimes they'll try and deplete the

2734
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:40,559
really common

2735
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:42,079
ribosomal sequences that are in the rna

2736
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,280
so they get more efficient sequencing

2737
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:45,519
but it's another it's

2738
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:47,039
expensive step um and then they blast

2739
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,080
that all through through dna dna

2740
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:49,840
sequencer

2741
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:51,039
and then filter that information for

2742
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,800
sequences that look like they're from

2743
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:54,719
the virus

2744
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,000
so there's some several viral databases

2745
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:58,319
out there that you can leverage that

2746
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,800
will scan your rna sequencing data for

2747
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:02,079
um for virus content but you know that's

2748
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,159
that's expensive that's

2749
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:05,760
you know you're talking about hundreds

2750
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:07,279
to thousands of dollars to do studies

2751
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,639
like that so it's not something that you

2752
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:11,439
just do on a whim

2753
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:12,000
um and so you find yourself in is the

2754
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:14,719
scenario

2755
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,158
of doing lots of tests for individual

2756
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:18,960
viruses of suspect

2757
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:19,839
now um i've not seen tobacco mosaic

2758
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,560
virus

2759
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,960
ever show up genetically i've seen

2760
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,639
people

2761
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,000
say they have it due to some pictures

2762
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:28,239
but i've not seen it

2763
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
actually show up in a test that proves

2764
01:25:28,238 --> 01:25:32,000
it was that it's probably something very

2765
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,119
related but not exactly tobacco mosaic

2766
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,840
virus it's probably

2767
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:37,039
a hops mosaic virus or something yeah um

2768
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:39,199
there's a few of those

2769
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:41,198
that have been listed so uh it does make

2770
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:43,279
for um

2771
01:25:41,198 --> 01:25:45,279
a bit more cumbersome of a test how they

2772
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:46,559
handle this in human clinical studies is

2773
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:49,119
they tend to have

2774
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,639
uh multiplex tests that look for a panel

2775
01:25:49,119 --> 01:25:52,880
of rhinoviruses

2776
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:55,440
uh so they and they maybe they first

2777
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:56,400
scan uh you know 20 or 30 of them with

2778
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:59,839
qpcr

2779
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:00,319
and then depending on what hits they get

2780
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,880
they might

2781
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:04,639
they might do uh narrow it down to some

2782
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,760
other some other ones so

2783
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:08,000
that's at least what they're doing with

2784
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:10,880
the coronavirus they have a test that

2785
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,920
looks at um a handful of cold common

2786
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:14,159
cold viruses

2787
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,440
rhinoviruses and norton and neurotype

2788
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:17,198
viruses

2789
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:18,559
and then if they see it's negative for

2790
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:21,198
all of those

2791
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:22,639
they've graduated to maybe a sars or a

2792
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:24,000
coronavirus test so i

2793
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:25,520
will probably see something similar like

2794
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,800
that in cannabis as there'll be a

2795
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,400
two-step screen

2796
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,400
and if you really need to know because

2797
01:26:28,399 --> 01:26:32,399
you're it's plaguing your entire grow

2798
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:34,799
you might graduate to doing uh dna

2799
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:36,399
sequencing and rna sequencing to

2800
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,639
really figure out this is something

2801
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:40,238
novel that's not never been seen before

2802
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:42,880
and now and you want to crush it that's

2803
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:44,718
that's usually what you do yeah

2804
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,400
yeah fascinating i know that's probably

2805
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:50,319
um

2806
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:52,559
yeah i know growers want that

2807
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:54,158
easy sort of detection fix i'm sure it's

2808
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,880
disappointing to hear that it's just not

2809
01:26:54,158 --> 01:26:58,158
there

2810
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:59,199
um but i i know many growers that have

2811
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:00,319
tried to battle with

2812
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:02,960
what they thought were nutrient

2813
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:04,960
deficiencies for far too long

2814
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:07,198
um trying to battle what would actually

2815
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,960
ended up being a virus and

2816
01:27:07,198 --> 01:27:10,559
you know just wasted a lot of time and

2817
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,679
everything and my response is usually

2818
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,239
like if you're really worried about it

2819
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:14,319
just

2820
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:15,919
can you just torch that plant and move

2821
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:17,840
on um

2822
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,600
you know rather than wasting so much

2823
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:21,520
energy and time

2824
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,960
um and some growers are now getting that

2825
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,560
point because their fields are so big

2826
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,560
now they're not worried about saving a

2827
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,600
single plant or a handful of plants so

2828
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:29,440
they're able to

2829
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,199
just cull the ones that seem to be

2830
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:34,158
causing problems and move on

2831
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:37,039
which would be more typical in bigger

2832
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:41,679
forms of agriculture

2833
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:44,079
moving changing gears quite a bit

2834
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:46,000
what are your thoughts on how genomics

2835
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:48,319
research is going to influence cannabis

2836
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,158
taxonomy in the future because that's

2837
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:52,000
that's a really muddy area

2838
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:53,198
in general cannabis taxonomy is one of

2839
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,560
these things that

2840
01:27:53,198 --> 01:27:57,759
nobody i mean even you know botanists

2841
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:00,719
and

2842
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:01,520
um chemists and geneticists it's hard to

2843
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:04,719
get on the same

2844
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:07,440
page on how to classify plants or even

2845
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:08,639
how to define what a species is um but

2846
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:11,198
where do you see that

2847
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:12,079
moving towards in the future so we're in

2848
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:14,559
this weird time

2849
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:15,198
frame where the entire phylogenetic tree

2850
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,440
of

2851
01:28:15,198 --> 01:28:19,039
life is getting redefined yeah yeah and

2852
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:21,119
so i'm kind of waiting for that dust to

2853
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:22,719
settle before i weigh in because

2854
01:28:21,119 --> 01:28:25,119
yeah i mean there's no way to do it

2855
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:27,279
genetically which is if you're 95

2856
01:28:25,119 --> 01:28:28,880
identical to this other microbe you're

2857
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:30,158
the same you know genre or the same

2858
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,679
species they're trying to make

2859
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:35,519
make metrics like that to begin

2860
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:37,359
calling these and is needed because we

2861
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,040
have a lot of redundant nomenclature

2862
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:40,559
even in the microbial

2863
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:42,800
side of things if you try and get

2864
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,520
aspergillus species out of atcc or other

2865
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,960
cell banks

2866
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,960
you'll find that a lot of them haven't

2867
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,399
been sequenced before and then you apply

2868
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,600
primers to them from the literature

2869
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:50,960
that are supposed to hit them and they

2870
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,239
don't and then you sequence this genome

2871
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:54,399
and realize it's not what they told you

2872
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:56,158
yes um so a lot of the stuff has all

2873
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:57,920
been been done with eyeballs

2874
01:28:56,158 --> 01:28:59,679
people looking at the morphology and

2875
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,920
looking at these things on plates

2876
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:04,158
and of course organisms can express

2877
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:06,319
really bizarre phenotypes i mean

2878
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:08,000
the classic cases is like a caterpillar

2879
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:10,000
and a butterfly right

2880
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,279
same genome complete you wouldn't if you

2881
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,198
looked at those things you wouldn't call

2882
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:14,960
them the same species

2883
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:17,359
if you look at aspergillus species they

2884
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:20,239
can be just as genetically diverse

2885
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:20,960
uh yet they look identical uh so you

2886
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:23,279
know

2887
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:25,198
the look of the of the species is no

2888
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:25,679
longer trustworthy for classifying them

2889
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:27,839
now

2890
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:30,560
speciation in general usually involves

2891
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:32,079
um whether they can continue to cross

2892
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,199
right we have cannabis plants that all

2893
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:34,719
cross with one another so they're

2894
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:36,158
arguably the same species now if you

2895
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:38,000
want to subdivide them into

2896
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:39,198
subspecies indica sativa and all that

2897
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,880
that's um

2898
01:29:39,198 --> 01:29:43,279
that's great but we we probably need

2899
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:45,279
some paleogenomics to really nail that

2900
01:29:43,279 --> 01:29:47,039
um if that's in fact the story that the

2901
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:49,920
indicas came out of one geographic

2902
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:51,600
region and at one point in time um and

2903
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,000
the sativas were more equatorial then

2904
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,679
maybe

2905
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,198
that will bear itself out but right now

2906
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:58,399
they've been so mixed

2907
01:29:55,198 --> 01:30:00,000
uh in and inappropriately named during

2908
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:02,000
that mixing process that that

2909
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,439
the sativa indica thing doesn't measure

2910
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,719
doesn't match up to any of the genetics

2911
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:07,919
right now yeah

2912
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:09,439
um so i i um i usually don't get

2913
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,639
involved in a lot of debates and whether

2914
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:13,119
we're going to call these things chemo

2915
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:15,039
bars cultivars or strains i tend to mock

2916
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:17,760
them actually because i

2917
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:19,198
i i i don't find a very productive

2918
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,119
conversation when the whole tree is

2919
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:23,839
getting rewritten we can argue over

2920
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:25,119
the taxonomy stuff later i tend to just

2921
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,639
read the dna because

2922
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:28,479
that's the answer you're really looking

2923
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:30,880
for what you're looking for

2924
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:33,039
in this categorization is how do these

2925
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:35,359
things differ biochemically

2926
01:30:33,039 --> 01:30:36,960
and so chemovar is a great name but it

2927
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:38,158
doesn't right now the king of ours we're

2928
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,198
measuring aren't really measuring the

2929
01:30:38,158 --> 01:30:41,279
flavonoids so

2930
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:42,319
i i don't view that as a legitimate way

2931
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:45,920
to necessarily

2932
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:49,198
draw the taxonomy um uh but ultimately

2933
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:52,239
it's the heritable units uh that are

2934
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:52,879
that govern the taxonomy that's taxonomy

2935
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:54,319
is dna

2936
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,000
and anyone who tries to tell you other

2937
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:58,479
words is going to be proven

2938
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,279
horribly wrong in time yeah and now i

2939
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:01,519
think that's

2940
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:03,198
really important to point out i remember

2941
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:05,440
when

2942
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:07,359
in some of my early graduate work

2943
01:31:05,439 --> 01:31:08,719
studying mycology how frustrating this

2944
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:11,759
issue was

2945
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:14,960
of learning um

2946
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:17,520
the taxonomy of you know different fungi

2947
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:18,880
and then tomorrow it changes because

2948
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:21,280
just like you said

2949
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:22,560
there'd be some genetic work that's done

2950
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:22,880
and they realize oh these things that

2951
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,800
look

2952
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:26,960
identical even under microscopy and

2953
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:29,600
everything they seem

2954
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:31,039
the same spores look the same have same

2955
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,880
ornamentation

2956
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:34,319
but they're different genetically and

2957
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,039
now we've got to call them something

2958
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:36,639
else so

2959
01:31:35,039 --> 01:31:40,238
students everything you learned wipe

2960
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:42,880
your brains like you know

2961
01:31:40,238 --> 01:31:43,759
now we're changing uh changing the whole

2962
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:46,960
system and

2963
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:48,639
and even botany too um you know i was i

2964
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:50,158
was a botanist with the uh

2965
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:52,319
the blm for wild bureau of land

2966
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:54,158
management um scouting native

2967
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:56,799
native plants around oregon and

2968
01:31:54,158 --> 01:31:58,000
everything and i realized um it had been

2969
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:01,039
a while since i've

2970
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,719
gone back and looked at um

2971
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:04,880
you know the scientific names of a lot

2972
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:06,800
of the plants that i worked with and

2973
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,920
um so just just a few months ago i went

2974
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,079
and looked and saw that

2975
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:12,158
about half of them that i was studying

2976
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:13,920
that had already gone through um

2977
01:32:12,158 --> 01:32:15,359
like general changes and that's where

2978
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,000
things have already gone through changes

2979
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:18,880
again

2980
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,039
and been reclassified um and split and

2981
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:23,359
everything and so it's just a headache

2982
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:25,519
of trying to keep up with all this stuff

2983
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:27,920
um

2984
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:29,920
to give you a sense of the the the wave

2985
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:32,158
of headache that's coming even further

2986
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:33,440
uh there the last study i heard i think

2987
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:35,279
was in the uk they're going to sequence

2988
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:37,439
a million species

2989
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:38,840
right yeah so once that happens

2990
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:40,000
everything that you learn you gotta

2991
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:43,119
rewrite so

2992
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,639
yeah yeah and uh it's we see the

2993
01:32:43,119 --> 01:32:45,840
aspergillus species are getting renamed

2994
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:48,639
all the time brazilians

2995
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,360
got got caught out of uh out of niger so

2996
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:50,639
um

2997
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:52,960
i have no doubt it's gonna happen in

2998
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:54,560
this field but i i've i guess i've been

2999
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,158
advising people in cannabis just stay

3000
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:58,000
tuned and be patient because

3001
01:32:56,158 --> 01:33:00,158
this is the wrong time i think to fight

3002
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,600
over those those terms

3003
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:03,279
because we're just in the earliest

3004
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,800
stages of sequencing everything and once

3005
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:06,880
we have a map of like 100

3006
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:08,480
000 different cannabis genomes i think

3007
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:09,199
we'll have a picture and we probably

3008
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:11,759
aren't gonna

3009
01:33:09,198 --> 01:33:13,119
try to force that picture into sativa uh

3010
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,520
you know indica

3011
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:17,599
antiquity uh we're probably gonna say

3012
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,239
okay the autoflowers are over here and

3013
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,679
the

3014
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:21,439
right the genotypes that have these

3015
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:23,600
types of clusters are over here and

3016
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:25,759
it'll be named in a coordinate system

3017
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:28,239
that's probably more related to

3018
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,679
large segmental uh duplications or

3019
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:31,919
deletions that are related to its

3020
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:34,239
diaspora around the planet

3021
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:36,079
yeah i agree and i think the main thing

3022
01:33:34,238 --> 01:33:37,439
you know any listeners that are

3023
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:39,519
banging their heads against the wall

3024
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:40,319
about what how to talk about cannabis

3025
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,320
varieties

3026
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:43,920
um you know the main thing is to think

3027
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:45,439
about like

3028
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:47,440
what are you trying to communicate in

3029
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:48,559
the first place and and what do you care

3030
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:50,479
about and that can

3031
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,800
sort of drive your vocabulary a little

3032
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:54,718
bit you know if you're

3033
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:56,320
if you're looking at cannabis varieties

3034
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:57,600
and you're trying to understand chemical

3035
01:33:56,319 --> 01:33:58,880
differences then talking about

3036
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,400
chemotypes and stuff

3037
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:02,719
could be valuable as long as you

3038
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:05,359
understand that that's a

3039
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:08,000
you know a a tool for us to communicate

3040
01:34:05,359 --> 01:34:11,198
things not necessarily some hard-coded

3041
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,960
taxonomic structure yeah exactly

3042
01:34:11,198 --> 01:34:14,479
yeah yeah i think that's important in

3043
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:16,399
general because it's very rare

3044
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:18,079
that science drives to a consensus we

3045
01:34:16,399 --> 01:34:21,439
want it to yes yeah

3046
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:23,198
but yeah i mean i think they changed the

3047
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:25,039
definition of the kilogram last year

3048
01:34:23,198 --> 01:34:26,799
right they did yeah they did yeah you

3049
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:30,238
know so you're like oh shit

3050
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:32,400
that can change right so that was like

3051
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:33,759
tied to some astronomical unit of

3052
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:35,759
wavelength of light or something i

3053
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:38,000
didn't realize it was ever going to

3054
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:39,600
change but they do and can sense hey

3055
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,520
there was a consensus against marijuana

3056
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:44,639
for 80 years it was pretty successful

3057
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:46,960
right yeah and clearly that's in the the

3058
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:48,960
latest stages of changing today so

3059
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:50,480
um yeah i think you're right it's it's

3060
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,158
about communication and sometimes the

3061
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:53,439
communication that's most popular is

3062
01:34:52,158 --> 01:34:56,559
probably technically wrong

3063
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:57,759
but if your goal is to communicate think

3064
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,280
the most amount of people that will

3065
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:01,360
understand what you're saying sometimes

3066
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:02,800
you just use the language that's that

3067
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:04,238
that conveys that most simply i think

3068
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,679
that's probably the case with what's

3069
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:08,000
happening with strain no one likes that

3070
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:09,920
name because it's a microbial term

3071
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,079
but if you exactly you know if you do a

3072
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:13,039
google trends on strain versus cultivar

3073
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:14,880
or chemovar

3074
01:35:13,039 --> 01:35:17,039
there's no one talking about cultivar

3075
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,039
chemo bar uh everyone's talking to

3076
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:20,399
continuing to talk about strain so if

3077
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:22,880
you want to effectively communicate to

3078
01:35:20,399 --> 01:35:25,279
large audiences sometimes you have to

3079
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,880
use those terms um the reason people put

3080
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:28,479
things in latin is because it's a dead

3081
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:31,359
language and the language doesn't change

3082
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:33,359
yeah and so we we don't yet have chemo

3083
01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:35,039
bar or cultivar necessarily in

3084
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:36,639
latin i think cultigen might be

3085
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:41,039
technically a combination of

3086
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:42,800
an acronym of latin terms but um it's uh

3087
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:44,158
i think it's all about making sure we

3088
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,000
have you know we have communication and

3089
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:46,319
not necessarily hard fixed religion

3090
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,439
because

3091
01:35:46,319 --> 01:35:49,039
there's one thing we're going to learn

3092
01:35:47,439 --> 01:35:50,799
in the next few years is that whatever

3093
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:52,719
we're seeing in this podcast today

3094
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:54,800
will probably be partially mocked as

3095
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:57,279
being wrong yeah in a few years

3096
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,639
yeah i mean um two things that come to

3097
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:00,399
mind there i mean one is

3098
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:02,000
uh i've always been a fan of richard

3099
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:04,399
feynman in his work

3100
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,600
particularly like as a science educator

3101
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:07,839
yeah i love that guy

3102
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:09,840
yeah he he did a lot of great work for

3103
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:11,360
science education in general much less

3104
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,039
you know the physics side of stuff he

3105
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:15,359
worked on but something he

3106
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:17,679
talked about in one of his late books

3107
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:19,679
called the meaning of it all

3108
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:21,039
and he talks about the the problem with

3109
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:24,158
science education

3110
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:26,639
in our culture is that most lay people

3111
01:36:24,158 --> 01:36:28,079
expect that's what science does is it

3112
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:30,719
produces facts

3113
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:31,600
and it produces you know in those facts

3114
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:33,039
everyone can

3115
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:34,480
form a consensus around them because

3116
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:35,359
they're facts they are known they're

3117
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:38,718
hard you know

3118
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:39,359
objective truths um but the reality for

3119
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:42,480
people that are

3120
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:44,960
you know actively doing research and

3121
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:45,678
um you know diving into all this stuff

3122
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,960
is you realize

3123
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:49,760
there there aren't a lot of hard facts

3124
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,319
if any

3125
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:54,079
and consensus is harder than you would

3126
01:36:52,319 --> 01:36:56,000
expect depending on what you're trying

3127
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:57,920
to get consensus over

3128
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,679
and what richard feynman said is that

3129
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:02,880
ultimately what science does is it

3130
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:05,118
gets at answers to questions it may not

3131
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:07,359
necessarily provide you the hard answer

3132
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:08,559
but it you know gravitates towards the

3133
01:37:07,359 --> 01:37:10,960
answer and it's always

3134
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,239
moving towards that answer even if it

3135
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:15,359
doesn't quite

3136
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:17,279
get to that very specific hard truth but

3137
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:18,799
when you talk to people uh like for

3138
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:20,960
instance on a political stage and you're

3139
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:22,560
talking about let's say climate change

3140
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,920
people want to know people want to know

3141
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,840
the facts they don't want to know that

3142
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:27,920
you've got some general idea of where

3143
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,960
the science is moving towards and

3144
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:31,199
you know they don't want to hear about

3145
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,520
probabilities and confidence intervals

3146
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:33,279
they

3147
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,719
you know they just want to know what's

3148
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:35,920
the state of things and what do we need

3149
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:38,639
to do

3150
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:39,279
um so when a politician is willing to

3151
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:43,118
just

3152
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:45,279
assert solid bold you know flat claims

3153
01:37:43,118 --> 01:37:46,880
um people resonate with that because

3154
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:49,279
it's a lot easier to digest

3155
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,719
than the actual muddiness of science

3156
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:51,118
yeah i know it's very true it's very

3157
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:54,158
true

3158
01:37:51,118 --> 01:37:57,359
it gets weaponized often times

3159
01:37:54,158 --> 01:37:59,198
i mean my my view on this is they

3160
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:00,880
they only separated the church in the

3161
01:37:59,198 --> 01:38:02,079
state so that they could replace the

3162
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:05,199
church with people

3163
01:38:02,079 --> 01:38:07,118
in white robes versus black robes yeah

3164
01:38:05,198 --> 01:38:08,479
and now the scientists are propped up as

3165
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:09,359
some kind of priest that can read the

3166
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:11,198
code of life

3167
01:38:09,359 --> 01:38:12,960
yeah um and everything that comes out of

3168
01:38:11,198 --> 01:38:14,238
their mouth is is ironclad truth and

3169
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,600
we're going to drive politics off of

3170
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:16,879
that and that's that's nothing could be

3171
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,719
further from the truth

3172
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,400
really is happening sciences we're

3173
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:21,359
generating questions not answers most of

3174
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:23,118
the time

3175
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:25,439
yeah yeah exactly no that's a that's a

3176
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:26,880
great point it's it is generally about

3177
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:28,079
trying to figure out what are the better

3178
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,920
questions to ask

3179
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:31,439
and then that drives what research

3180
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:33,279
you're going to do and and how you're

3181
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:37,118
going to approach a question and

3182
01:38:33,279 --> 01:38:39,599
um isaac asimov another um

3183
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:40,399
writer science educator you know even

3184
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:44,320
though he he

3185
01:38:40,399 --> 01:38:47,839
wrote a lot of um fiction he had a

3186
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:50,559
a paper that he wrote in response to

3187
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,360
someone criticizing a statement he made

3188
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:54,480
about

3189
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:56,079
um you know basically kind of like what

3190
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:58,000
you said just earlier that you know in

3191
01:38:56,079 --> 01:38:59,519
10 years everything we're saying now

3192
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,279
a large part of it is going to be you

3193
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,719
know mocked out and thought of as wrong

3194
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:04,479
he made a statement like that and

3195
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:05,520
someone said well you know if that's the

3196
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:08,638
case then

3197
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:12,400
you know does that mean that um

3198
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:12,960
essentially um a lot of things are

3199
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:14,719
wasted

3200
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:18,239
and that anything could be overturned at

3201
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:20,239
any time and he was like well no no like

3202
01:39:18,238 --> 01:39:22,399
what that means is just that our

3203
01:39:20,238 --> 01:39:24,079
understanding gets sharper over time and

3204
01:39:22,399 --> 01:39:25,679
it feeds off of what came before

3205
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:27,679
it's not that what's going to come after

3206
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:30,639
is going to be totally

3207
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:32,319
you know irrelevant and in total

3208
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:33,679
opposition to the science that's

3209
01:39:32,319 --> 01:39:36,319
happening now

3210
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:38,239
it's just going to keep pressing forward

3211
01:39:36,319 --> 01:39:40,158
and i think the example he used was like

3212
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:42,079
the um the

3213
01:39:40,158 --> 01:39:43,839
spherical nature of the earth and how

3214
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:45,519
you know eventually we learned that it's

3215
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,600
not a perfect sphere and that it's

3216
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,960
you know sort of like a lemon in a way

3217
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,039
you know it has

3218
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,359
you know this sort of oblong nature to

3219
01:39:51,039 --> 01:39:54,479
it and it even kind of like wiggles and

3220
01:39:53,359 --> 01:39:57,519
moves and

3221
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:59,678
um and you know before that it was

3222
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:02,719
assumed that you know the earth was

3223
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:03,679
was flat you're right yeah you know all

3224
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:05,679
these things and so

3225
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:07,600
just pointing that you know these these

3226
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:08,239
aren't total overhauls of what came

3227
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,719
before

3228
01:40:08,238 --> 01:40:12,399
but their refinements and you know it's

3229
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:15,600
like getting the

3230
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:17,198
uh clarity tuned up even more as

3231
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:19,039
as things go on i think that's important

3232
01:40:17,198 --> 01:40:20,238
for people to understand that you know

3233
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,158
what we're saying is

3234
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:23,359
not that all this is just getting thrown

3235
01:40:22,158 --> 01:40:24,879
out and that you know a lot of

3236
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:25,519
scientists are essentially wasting their

3237
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:28,239
time

3238
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,600
but that you know we're all standing on

3239
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:30,479
the shoulders of everyone that's come

3240
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,159
before

3241
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:34,000
and people 10 years from now are just

3242
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:37,519
going to have a very different

3243
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,560
set of eyes than we have now yeah i mean

3244
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,920
that's

3245
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:42,639
to me that's probably the most

3246
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:46,480
compelling um argument i've heard

3247
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:48,400
in this climate debate is that um

3248
01:40:46,479 --> 01:40:50,319
the number of ideas that are human

3249
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:52,399
generated tend to be cumulative

3250
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:54,639
like they're they're idea bridging and

3251
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:56,638
so the fact that we had twice the amount

3252
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:58,239
of population back when einstein was

3253
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:01,199
around or or edison

3254
01:40:58,238 --> 01:41:02,000
or you know you know pasteur right pick

3255
01:41:01,198 --> 01:41:04,079
you know

3256
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,000
if you did population control because

3257
01:41:04,079 --> 01:41:07,600
you were concerned that we

3258
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,960
weren't going to be smart enough to

3259
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,800
figure out how to use things more

3260
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:12,960
resourcefully

3261
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,320
you would have picked off you know

3262
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:16,399
einstein or

3263
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:17,759
maybe maybe pasture and then where would

3264
01:41:16,399 --> 01:41:19,519
the world be if we only had electricity

3265
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:22,400
and not the germ theory of disease right

3266
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:24,480
the fact that we have uh that we had the

3267
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:26,879
population we had back then

3268
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:28,479
uh we are so much more richer and more

3269
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:30,079
um resourceful today

3270
01:41:28,479 --> 01:41:31,678
than than we would have been if we

3271
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:32,399
actually choked the population back then

3272
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:35,279
so

3273
01:41:32,399 --> 01:41:36,960
yeah i i think it's a really important

3274
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:39,118
it goes back to the concept of humans

3275
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:40,639
not necessarily being a cancer cell on

3276
01:41:39,118 --> 01:41:42,238
the planet we're actually part of this

3277
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:43,679
thing we have to learn as much as we can

3278
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:45,839
about it so that we don't

3279
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:47,279
uh we don't unwisely use the resources

3280
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:50,560
that we have but

3281
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:52,158
um ingenuity is um is very important and

3282
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:53,920
i think the evidence is pretty clear if

3283
01:41:52,158 --> 01:41:55,599
you look at people's standard of living

3284
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:57,440
and if you look at people's income

3285
01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:00,560
they tend to become more environmental

3286
01:41:57,439 --> 01:42:02,000
as that goes up over time

3287
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,760
a lot of the environmental damage is

3288
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,679
done due to poverty and more people are

3289
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:07,360
moving out of poverty than ever before

3290
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:09,279
and so we actually have a really bright

3291
01:42:07,359 --> 01:42:10,799
future that you won't hear about in the

3292
01:42:09,279 --> 01:42:11,840
political sphere because that's about

3293
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,039
selling fear

3294
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,279
yeah that we're all going to die

3295
01:42:13,039 --> 01:42:18,000
tomorrow from coronavirus and uh

3296
01:42:15,279 --> 01:42:20,000
tsunami or something but uh i think uh

3297
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,319
i'm very optimistic about the fact that

3298
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,439
um the population is going to be fine

3299
01:42:22,319 --> 01:42:24,880
that i think we're

3300
01:42:23,439 --> 01:42:27,118
science is going to be it's

3301
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:29,840
exponentially building upon itself

3302
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:30,639
and we often underestimate that that

3303
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,480
fact i mean

3304
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:34,480
just now we're in the first generation

3305
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:36,959
of people who have access

3306
01:42:34,479 --> 01:42:37,678
to all information knowable yeah on

3307
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,158
their phone

3308
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:42,000
yeah right school is now irrelevant no

3309
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:42,238
one wants to say that but it is right if

3310
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,520
you're

3311
01:42:42,238 --> 01:42:45,439
you if you like to read and you're

3312
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,000
curious you don't need school you need

3313
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:48,000
your phone

3314
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,118
um yeah and no parent wants to say that

3315
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,960
to their kid but

3316
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:52,639
uh we didn't have that when we went to

3317
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:54,319
school we had to go to centralized

3318
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:56,000
campuses where all the information was

3319
01:42:54,319 --> 01:42:57,920
literally stacked on paper into

3320
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,118
in the libraries that in microfiche so

3321
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,480
we could comb through this stuff

3322
01:42:59,118 --> 01:43:02,000
and be near the people who were smart

3323
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:03,439
who already read it but now we can be

3324
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,840
near those people on conversations like

3325
01:43:03,439 --> 01:43:06,158
this

3326
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:08,000
and uh and have all the information

3327
01:43:06,158 --> 01:43:10,799
that's going to radically change

3328
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:12,399
uh idea generation yeah and and it's

3329
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:15,279
going to radically change

3330
01:43:12,399 --> 01:43:17,198
um people's access to capital and the

3331
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:19,118
ability for people to grow and to invent

3332
01:43:17,198 --> 01:43:21,678
and to become more resourceful with

3333
01:43:19,118 --> 01:43:22,399
uh with the limited amount of resources

3334
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:24,000
we have

3335
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:25,118
um and i think it's really exciting that

3336
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,399
cannabis is like emerging from

3337
01:43:25,118 --> 01:43:28,238
prohibition during all of this

3338
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:29,599
because yeah we now have probably one of

3339
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:30,319
the most resourceful plants on the

3340
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:32,480
planet

3341
01:43:30,319 --> 01:43:34,158
where people have been restricted from

3342
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:34,799
being able to really adequately study it

3343
01:43:34,158 --> 01:43:37,599
and now

3344
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:39,279
the gates are open and we can study one

3345
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,920
of the best photosynthetic organisms we

3346
01:43:39,279 --> 01:43:41,599
have

3347
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:43,279
uh that can literally you know feed the

3348
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:45,039
world with this thing yeah uh

3349
01:43:43,279 --> 01:43:46,639
so there's a tremendous amount of

3350
01:43:45,039 --> 01:43:47,600
potential i think for solving a lot of

3351
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:50,480
these climate

3352
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:52,880
concerns people have i think just by you

3353
01:43:50,479 --> 01:43:55,279
know doing what we do so well with hemp

3354
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,560
uh learn this thing figure out its code

3355
01:43:55,279 --> 01:43:58,000
figure out how to tweak it figure out

3356
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:59,280
how it interacts best with the

3357
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,039
environment and that's going to be a

3358
01:43:59,279 --> 01:44:02,079
combination of not its genome but also

3359
01:44:01,039 --> 01:44:04,479
the microbes that

3360
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:05,760
are in the soil and the more we can

3361
01:44:04,479 --> 01:44:07,279
learn about that we're probably not

3362
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:08,239
going to come to consensus about what it

3363
01:44:07,279 --> 01:44:09,759
all means

3364
01:44:08,238 --> 01:44:11,359
but as feinbeen is saying we're going to

3365
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,880
be pushing ourselves in the arc of being

3366
01:44:11,359 --> 01:44:14,639
more and more efficient with what

3367
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:18,159
limited stuff we have here

3368
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:20,560
yeah yeah man yeah that's such a

3369
01:44:18,158 --> 01:44:22,559
great summary to bring this whole

3370
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:25,360
conversation back around

3371
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,840
um i really appreciate how much time

3372
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:27,198
you've been

3373
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:28,960
willing to spend with me we've been

3374
01:44:27,198 --> 01:44:29,759
going for almost an hour and 45 minutes

3375
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:32,399
i have a

3376
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,960
a couple a couple of uh closing

3377
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:36,638
questions

3378
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:38,480
for you to to cap us off one is um

3379
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:39,920
what other research interests do you

3380
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:42,959
have beyond

3381
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:44,239
cannabis um i usually like to ask every

3382
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:47,039
every scientist i interview that

3383
01:44:44,238 --> 01:44:50,559
question so i'm really interested

3384
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:52,560
in um other pathways that

3385
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:53,840
are in its neighboring plants lately so

3386
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:55,840
i've been looking a lot at

3387
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:57,279
the um and also this concept of xeno

3388
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,400
xeno hormesis that

3389
01:44:57,279 --> 01:45:02,399
um your your previous guest kevin

3390
01:45:00,399 --> 01:45:03,439
spellman will probably have a lot to say

3391
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:07,039
about it but

3392
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:08,079
um so uh hops has a similar pathway that

3393
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:09,600
makes terpenes and

3394
01:45:08,079 --> 01:45:10,960
it makes a different set of compounds

3395
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,800
that might i would probably call the

3396
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:13,359
analogous medicinal compounds and hops

3397
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:16,320
or the uh

3398
01:45:13,359 --> 01:45:17,920
xantho humor okay yeah yeah right and

3399
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:19,439
and those compounds are starting to show

3400
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:20,239
anti-cancer properties much like the

3401
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:21,839
cannabinoids

3402
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:24,079
um we don't know really what receptors

3403
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:27,039
they had and why

3404
01:45:24,079 --> 01:45:28,238
but everything that's needed to make

3405
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:30,800
those compounds

3406
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:31,839
uh has some homology to the cannabis

3407
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,119
genome

3408
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:35,039
it's possible the cannabis gene could be

3409
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:37,279
making some of those compounds as well

3410
01:45:35,039 --> 01:45:38,960
um i don't know if it's going to need to

3411
01:45:37,279 --> 01:45:39,759
be crossed into it or how that would how

3412
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,800
we

3413
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:42,000
genetically engineer it but it's

3414
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,440
something that it makes you turn back

3415
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,479
and look at all these other plants that

3416
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:45,759
we've taken for granted

3417
01:45:44,479 --> 01:45:47,359
and start to ask but what are the

3418
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:48,000
secondary metabolites in those plants

3419
01:45:47,359 --> 01:45:49,279
because yes

3420
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,359
the only reason we've paid so much

3421
01:45:49,279 --> 01:45:53,439
attention to cannabis is that

3422
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:54,238
one of them has a really easy bio assay

3423
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:55,519
to tell you when you're getting

3424
01:45:54,238 --> 01:45:58,479
something right chc

3425
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:00,560
yeah we don't have that in in in hops we

3426
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:01,359
might have beta-carotene which is a cb2

3427
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,039
agonist but you

3428
01:46:01,359 --> 01:46:04,399
you probably can't really feel that

3429
01:46:03,039 --> 01:46:05,198
unless you're in pain and you take a lot

3430
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:07,198
of it

3431
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:09,519
um so all these other compounds that we

3432
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:11,118
can't really perceptually feel

3433
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,960
uh we need to go back and look at

3434
01:46:11,118 --> 01:46:15,359
because they've been

3435
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,319
the the fda system is selecting against

3436
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:18,158
these things yeah

3437
01:46:16,319 --> 01:46:19,439
uh in many ways the the regulatory

3438
01:46:18,158 --> 01:46:19,839
environment we have here in the united

3439
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:23,039
states

3440
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:24,639
favors um large largely capitalized

3441
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:26,399
companies that can then pay politicians

3442
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:28,079
to limit the regulatory space of the

3443
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:29,039
operators and so the genetics tend to go

3444
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:29,840
through bottlenecks in those

3445
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:31,760
environments

3446
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:33,600
and we end up having massive genetic

3447
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:36,159
shifts because of regulations

3448
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:37,360
um yeah and so i'm i'm somewhat

3449
01:46:36,158 --> 01:46:39,039
fascinated about the impact of

3450
01:46:37,359 --> 01:46:39,599
regulation on genetic drift because i

3451
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:41,279
think

3452
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,199
there's genocides going on all over the

3453
01:46:41,279 --> 01:46:44,559
place uh as a result of this this point

3454
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:45,519
three percent thing is going to create a

3455
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,920
massive just like

3456
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:48,639
prohibition yeah creating rich type one

3457
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:50,079
genetics

3458
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:52,000
and probably a depletion of a lot of

3459
01:46:50,079 --> 01:46:53,198
type threes this point three things

3460
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,639
gonna have the opposite effect it's

3461
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:56,559
going to end up meaning

3462
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:58,239
we're going to have to select a very

3463
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:59,840
narrow set of cultivars to move forward

3464
01:46:58,238 --> 01:47:01,118
that are compliant with the usda and

3465
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,400
it's going to wipe out all types of

3466
01:47:01,118 --> 01:47:04,719
diversity we don't know yet

3467
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:05,599
because the those selections arguably

3468
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:07,359
are going to wipe out these other

3469
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,960
secondary metabolites no one's measuring

3470
01:47:07,359 --> 01:47:10,719
right no one's going to be measuring the

3471
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:11,520
can flavon pathways in the process of

3472
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:13,279
doing these

3473
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:14,639
i mean we are we have sequencing that

3474
01:47:13,279 --> 01:47:15,359
looks at that pathway but very few

3475
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:16,560
people

3476
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:18,880
are necessarily going to jump on that

3477
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,960
train right away um so the process of

3478
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,000
even putting in microbial regulations in

3479
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:24,960
place

3480
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,960
this means plants that like and enjoy a

3481
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,079
particular microbial background

3482
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:30,000
are going to get eliminated from the

3483
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:31,439
population yeah right let's say you have

3484
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,800
the plant that needs trichoderma

3485
01:47:31,439 --> 01:47:34,559
tracheoderma is not harmful

3486
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:36,000
yet some of the regulations in some

3487
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:38,960
states don't have

3488
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,520
cfu language right colony forming units

3489
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:40,960
they're

3490
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:44,080
in they don't know what the hell they're

3491
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:47,198
counting they're just saying exactly

3492
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:50,158
right it's it's really really um uh

3493
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:51,678
ignorant uh for to think of micro

3494
01:47:50,158 --> 01:47:53,839
microbiomes that way

3495
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:55,760
so when you put that in place all of the

3496
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:57,520
plants that can get through regulation

3497
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:59,920
then go through a genetic shift right

3498
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,920
you get the selection for plants

3499
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:03,199
that tolerate low microbe environments

3500
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,158
well those may not necessarily be the

3501
01:48:03,198 --> 01:48:05,519
most productive

3502
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:06,960
plants from a secondary metabolite

3503
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,480
standpoint no one's looking at that

3504
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,359
they're just looking at maybe thc and

3505
01:48:08,479 --> 01:48:12,000
cbd

3506
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:13,519
but all these other flavonoids might be

3507
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,118
abolished in the practice of

3508
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:16,639
doing that so i'm kind of curious at

3509
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:17,279
seeing where that's where that's going

3510
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:19,039
but

3511
01:48:17,279 --> 01:48:20,399
um the xantho-humel thing in the

3512
01:48:19,039 --> 01:48:23,679
xenohermesis is just

3513
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:26,319
this concept that these plants um

3514
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:26,719
are making these secondary metabolites

3515
01:48:26,319 --> 01:48:28,880
uh

3516
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:30,639
to communicate to the things that

3517
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:33,679
propagate their genetics

3518
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:36,800
right so uh if you were to actually

3519
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:38,239
look at the number of cannabis cells

3520
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,760
and the number of genomes that are

3521
01:48:38,238 --> 01:48:41,759
dividing throughout space and time

3522
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:43,520
there's probably a good argument

3523
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,920
that it's winning that race compared to

3524
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:46,960
humans that we are propagating more

3525
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:49,118
cannabis dna

3526
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:50,399
right now than human dna yeah because of

3527
01:48:49,118 --> 01:48:52,000
the nature of

3528
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:53,679
how big some of these plants can get how

3529
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,439
big their genome is the fact that they

3530
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:56,399
replicate every every like you know 12

3531
01:48:55,439 --> 01:48:58,799
weeks and humans

3532
01:48:56,399 --> 01:49:00,000
don't replicate that quickly um means

3533
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:01,840
that some numbers i've

3534
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,039
drawn out suggest that yeah the cannabis

3535
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:06,319
genome has

3536
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:07,600
actually done a remarkable job finding

3537
01:49:06,319 --> 01:49:09,679
an ideal pollinator

3538
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:12,239
um that likes to propagate it all over

3539
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:12,719
the world and how to do that it did that

3540
01:49:12,238 --> 01:49:14,879
by

3541
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:17,520
being able to make secondary metabolites

3542
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:19,840
that tap into our biochemistry

3543
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,280
uh to tell us that changes in the

3544
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:23,039
environment are coming or

3545
01:49:21,279 --> 01:49:24,559
or what have you um so this work is all

3546
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:25,760
done by david sinclair he's a guy who

3547
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,400
does a lot of work on the fountain of

3548
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:28,719
youth

3549
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:29,839
uh and resveratrol and many of these

3550
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:30,800
compounds that are involved in that

3551
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:32,639
pathway but

3552
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:33,920
he's got a great paper out there um

3553
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:36,480
called xenohermesis

3554
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:37,520
and it talks about how these plants when

3555
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:39,198
the environment changes

3556
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,560
they shift the secondary metabolites

3557
01:49:39,198 --> 01:49:41,359
they make so that the things that eat

3558
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:43,679
them

3559
01:49:41,359 --> 01:49:45,439
their their mtor pathway gets triggered

3560
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:47,199
so that they start going into caloric

3561
01:49:45,439 --> 01:49:48,960
restriction because the plants

3562
01:49:47,198 --> 01:49:50,158
biochemistry has changed to know that

3563
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:51,118
the environment is going to change and

3564
01:49:50,158 --> 01:49:51,598
it's going to have an impact on the

3565
01:49:51,118 --> 01:49:54,799
amount of

3566
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:56,079
of material that it can feed the um the

3567
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:58,239
thing that's supposed to procrastinate

3568
01:49:56,079 --> 01:50:01,039
so that whole interaction space

3569
01:49:58,238 --> 01:50:01,359
i think is the key to cancer and if we

3570
01:50:01,039 --> 01:50:03,039
can

3571
01:50:01,359 --> 01:50:04,880
understand how those plants are

3572
01:50:03,039 --> 01:50:06,399
signaling the metabolism of the things

3573
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:08,719
that propagate their seeds we will

3574
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:10,000
understand cancer in a much better way

3575
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:12,399
and a much more thorough understanding

3576
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,920
of cancer because usually cancer

3577
01:50:12,399 --> 01:50:18,319
is a scenario of your own genome

3578
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:20,399
having a metabolic defect going on in

3579
01:50:18,319 --> 01:50:22,559
the sub population of the cells and that

3580
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:24,638
that metabolism is getting triggered and

3581
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,840
it's usually because of an acidic or

3582
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:27,679
you know a different environment a

3583
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:28,880
mutation that's happened uh and the

3584
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:31,599
things that seem to be

3585
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:33,440
having the most potent effect on our um

3586
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:35,279
on our cellular metabolism

3587
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:36,960
are the vegetables and plants the foods

3588
01:50:35,279 --> 01:50:38,639
that we eat right

3589
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,239
and that's what we need to better

3590
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:40,880
understand to really understand cancer

3591
01:50:40,238 --> 01:50:42,559
so

3592
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:43,920
um i kind of like that intersection of

3593
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:46,000
plant metabolites and

3594
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:46,960
cancer uh it kind of touches home for us

3595
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,639
and uh

3596
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:52,560
it's uh it's a field that um i think our

3597
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:54,719
myopic focus at the fda

3598
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:56,320
is constantly deteriorating because they

3599
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:58,079
have this

3600
01:50:56,319 --> 01:50:59,519
reductionist approach of looking at

3601
01:50:58,079 --> 01:51:00,960
single compounds as opposed to

3602
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:03,199
symphonies of them

3603
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:05,279
and we're at a stage now where we we

3604
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:07,759
have the tools to look at symphonies

3605
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:08,319
they just don't fit into their trials

3606
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:10,400
very well

3607
01:51:08,319 --> 01:51:11,439
exactly and uh and we need to rethink

3608
01:51:10,399 --> 01:51:13,118
whether their trials

3609
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:15,039
are the right way to do medicine i i

3610
01:51:13,118 --> 01:51:16,559
happen to think they're not

3611
01:51:15,039 --> 01:51:18,238
that you can get a hell of a lot more

3612
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:20,320
power out of a study with a hundred

3613
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:22,399
thousand to a million people connected

3614
01:51:20,319 --> 01:51:23,759
via observational trials on digital

3615
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:24,559
equipment like we do with peer-to-peer

3616
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,400
networks

3617
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:28,080
and five thousand or ten thousand people

3618
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:29,920
in a trial that is

3619
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:31,118
a sub-sampling of statistics to the

3620
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:33,118
point where you

3621
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:34,799
end up with vioxx like compounds that

3622
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:36,960
escape that process

3623
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,800
yeah i mean and not to mention the way

3624
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:41,920
that the clinical trial

3625
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:44,719
system is set up right now it it

3626
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:45,118
creates such a high barrier to entry to

3627
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:47,760
even

3628
01:51:45,118 --> 01:51:48,399
try to get to get through that process

3629
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:50,480
you know

3630
01:51:48,399 --> 01:51:52,399
yeah it literally kills people and

3631
01:51:50,479 --> 01:51:53,839
there's no one willing to look at

3632
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:55,759
the you know the scene in the unseen

3633
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:57,920
here it's like okay the fact that a drug

3634
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:59,360
takes 500 million dollars and you know

3635
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:00,880
10 years to get through

3636
01:51:59,359 --> 01:52:02,319
has anyone done a survey and the number

3637
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,920
of people that died waiting for that

3638
01:52:02,319 --> 01:52:05,439
drop right knowing that it's available

3639
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:06,960
in europe and it's available

3640
01:52:05,439 --> 01:52:08,719
other countries have deemed it safe but

3641
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:09,760
not here and those people don't have the

3642
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:11,118
money to travel there

3643
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:12,800
to do it so they sit here they wait and

3644
01:52:11,118 --> 01:52:14,238
they die yeah and there's people who

3645
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,760
study this and it's a large number of

3646
01:52:14,238 --> 01:52:17,198
people every year the independent

3647
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:17,920
institute does a lot of work on this

3648
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:20,079
called um

3649
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,359
under fdareview.org it's worth reading

3650
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:22,399
because they go through all the

3651
01:52:21,359 --> 01:52:24,639
scenarios where

3652
01:52:22,399 --> 01:52:25,598
drugs that were approved in others in

3653
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:28,400
other countries

3654
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:30,159
so they pass you know other countries

3655
01:52:28,399 --> 01:52:31,519
criteria and eventually passed here but

3656
01:52:30,158 --> 01:52:32,879
three or four years later and they count

3657
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,760
the number of deaths that occur because

3658
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:36,239
of this

3659
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:36,800
um and no one's responsible for this no

3660
01:52:36,238 --> 01:52:39,039
uh

3661
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:40,880
and the you can't vote them in or out

3662
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:42,238
and i think they regulate now like 25

3663
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:45,118
cents of every dollar

3664
01:52:42,238 --> 01:52:46,238
so this is something that is um i'm

3665
01:52:45,118 --> 01:52:47,519
totally terrified

3666
01:52:46,238 --> 01:52:49,759
that it's going to come into the

3667
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:51,199
cannabis space and somehow um

3668
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:53,199
make the same mess of this space as it

3669
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:55,279
did the opiates that being said there's

3670
01:52:53,198 --> 01:52:57,919
a lot of good scientists that work there

3671
01:52:55,279 --> 01:52:58,319
that yeah have all the right intentions

3672
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:00,880
and

3673
01:52:58,319 --> 01:53:02,479
they are trying to put genetics into all

3674
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:04,319
the programs they're trying to

3675
01:53:02,479 --> 01:53:05,839
build blockchains to track all the food

3676
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:07,679
so they they've got all the right

3677
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:08,880
vision i just think they don't recognize

3678
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:10,560
that um

3679
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:12,960
it's too big of a problem for one

3680
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:14,639
centralized organization to solve

3681
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:16,319
uh and it's too prone to regulatory

3682
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:18,239
capture and corruption that

3683
01:53:16,319 --> 01:53:19,599
um they shouldn't set up that honeypot

3684
01:53:18,238 --> 01:53:21,118
they should somehow

3685
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:24,400
decentralize it and have competing

3686
01:53:21,118 --> 01:53:26,158
agencies that can perhaps

3687
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:27,598
invent different ways of regulating

3688
01:53:26,158 --> 01:53:29,439
because right it's certainly an

3689
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:31,039
important feature of a marketplace down

3690
01:53:29,439 --> 01:53:32,719
regulation but not necessarily in the

3691
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:34,719
way that it's getting done today

3692
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:36,158
yeah and i mean i also find it kind of

3693
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:39,279
funny that

3694
01:53:36,158 --> 01:53:40,238
um you know a lot of times uh drug

3695
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:43,920
approvals approvals

3696
01:53:40,238 --> 01:53:46,238
get so hung up on needing to prove

3697
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:47,118
a certain level of safety sometimes to

3698
01:53:46,238 --> 01:53:48,879
kind of an

3699
01:53:47,118 --> 01:53:50,799
absurd extent i mean right now we're

3700
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:54,480
seeing this with cbd right now that

3701
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:56,560
you know what the liver talk stuff yeah

3702
01:53:54,479 --> 01:53:58,319
yeah exactly and you know and not

3703
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:59,520
acknowledging the nuance around

3704
01:53:58,319 --> 01:54:01,198
you know some of that research and

3705
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:02,639
everything but what's interesting is

3706
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:04,319
that the actual efficacy

3707
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:05,840
of a lot of pharmaceuticals that

3708
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:08,880
actually make it through

3709
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:11,440
the process are not that effective

3710
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,118
you know maybe for 20 30 of the target

3711
01:54:11,439 --> 01:54:15,359
population they may be effective

3712
01:54:13,118 --> 01:54:16,639
um right and and they have terrible

3713
01:54:15,359 --> 01:54:19,839
safety profiles

3714
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:22,560
um and so it's i don't know it's a

3715
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:23,279
it's a weird dynamic that the the safety

3716
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:25,920
profile

3717
01:54:23,279 --> 01:54:26,319
of a lot of these natural products that

3718
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:28,399
people

3719
01:54:26,319 --> 01:54:30,399
want to research and try to understand

3720
01:54:28,399 --> 01:54:32,158
how they can be elevated out of the

3721
01:54:30,399 --> 01:54:34,559
realm of sort of

3722
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:36,238
you know this alternative medicine

3723
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:37,599
sphere and try to understand like what

3724
01:54:36,238 --> 01:54:38,638
they're actually doing and how to

3725
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:40,800
actually you know

3726
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:41,679
legitimize them as medicines it's very

3727
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:43,760
challenging

3728
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:44,880
um even though the safety profiles of a

3729
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:47,440
lot of these things are

3730
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:48,239
pretty well understood by this point

3731
01:54:47,439 --> 01:54:49,678
yeah and

3732
01:54:48,238 --> 01:54:52,079
the i think the other big hang up

3733
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:54,319
they've got is uh there is this

3734
01:54:52,079 --> 01:54:56,158
gold standard um almost religious

3735
01:54:54,319 --> 01:54:57,920
consensus as you mentioned before

3736
01:54:56,158 --> 01:54:59,920
on double-blind placebo-controlled

3737
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:01,840
trials being the only path to ensuring

3738
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:04,239
safety of medicine and i think that's

3739
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:06,000
being fundamentally challenged by

3740
01:55:04,238 --> 01:55:07,598
if you look at the the work on what

3741
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,960
governs the placebo effect it starts

3742
01:55:07,599 --> 01:55:09,440
pointing back to the endocannabinoid

3743
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:12,158
system

3744
01:55:09,439 --> 01:55:13,598
yeah uh and so there's actually papers

3745
01:55:12,158 --> 01:55:15,118
out there on on the endo

3746
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:16,960
endocannabinoids is being involved in

3747
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:17,598
the placebo effect and analgesia right

3748
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:19,439
so

3749
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:20,719
how do you put cannabinoid through

3750
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:23,519
double-blind placebo-controlled

3751
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:24,000
trials yeah placebo effect we think is

3752
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,440
is

3753
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,399
is people's reactions they're they're

3754
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:29,678
ecs their production and anxiety is

3755
01:55:28,399 --> 01:55:31,118
caused probably by anandamide or

3756
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:32,880
something that when they take something

3757
01:55:31,118 --> 01:55:34,479
they're taking control of their problem

3758
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:35,840
they're they're taking action and that

3759
01:55:34,479 --> 01:55:37,198
action gives them confidence and that

3760
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,599
boosts their inanimate levels maybe

3761
01:55:37,198 --> 01:55:40,158
right

3762
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:40,719
and so the very pathway that you're

3763
01:55:40,158 --> 01:55:42,479
trying to

3764
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:44,480
interact with is what's involved in the

3765
01:55:42,479 --> 01:55:45,839
placebo process so

3766
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:47,919
i think that's just all going to create

3767
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:49,760
noise and we should be looking at very

3768
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:51,199
large observational studies that

3769
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:52,960
that we can enable now with these

3770
01:55:51,198 --> 01:55:54,319
digital tools that we have

3771
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:56,480
uh and that's probably going to give us

3772
01:55:54,319 --> 01:55:58,000
a far faster and more i mean

3773
01:55:56,479 --> 01:55:59,678
back up and just look at the vape crisis

3774
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:02,319
right right yeah so

3775
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:03,920
this is a cox 2 inhibitor um you know

3776
01:56:02,319 --> 01:56:05,039
cbd a lot of people are vaping cbd

3777
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:06,719
sometimes thc

3778
01:56:05,039 --> 01:56:08,560
and they both have analgesic effects and

3779
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:10,719
so i throw them into that category

3780
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:12,719
of advil and ibuprofen replacements

3781
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:15,279
maybe even tylenol tylenol is in fact

3782
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:17,520
an endocannabinoid member it makes am404

3783
01:56:15,279 --> 01:56:18,800
with a shitty liver metabolism but

3784
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:20,000
so people are vaping these things

3785
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:21,599
probably because they like getting a

3786
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,319
little relief from some pain and some

3787
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:25,360
fun

3788
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:26,319
um that took the field probably 10

3789
01:56:25,359 --> 01:56:27,759
months to resolve

3790
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:30,000
right because everyone was sharing

3791
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:31,840
information rumor came out of this this

3792
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,399
company's making crap this one's got bad

3793
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:35,599
vitamin

3794
01:56:32,399 --> 01:56:37,279
acetate ideas are flying and with all of

3795
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:39,520
the networking we have

3796
01:56:37,279 --> 01:56:41,359
there's a crisis that was affecting

3797
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:42,880
maybe a thousand to two thousand people

3798
01:56:41,359 --> 01:56:44,639
right there was nine million vape pens

3799
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:46,400
sold a month right 90 million

3800
01:56:44,639 --> 01:56:48,000
maybe 100 million over the course of the

3801
01:56:46,399 --> 01:56:49,839
year and

3802
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,920
we only had an incident rate of one and

3803
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:54,800
forty five thousand right effectively

3804
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:56,399
um now there's that that's one piece of

3805
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:58,159
uh arithmetic that's important for how

3806
01:56:56,399 --> 01:56:59,198
quick how frequently we sample for these

3807
01:56:58,158 --> 01:57:01,279
contaminants in canvas we're not

3808
01:56:59,198 --> 01:57:03,198
sampling nearly deep enough to find

3809
01:57:01,279 --> 01:57:04,880
a frequency below so even if we were

3810
01:57:03,198 --> 01:57:06,238
testing for vitamin e acetate i'd argue

3811
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:08,639
we still would have missed it

3812
01:57:06,238 --> 01:57:10,079
because the frequency of of this

3813
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:11,440
creating a problem is so low

3814
01:57:10,079 --> 01:57:13,118
that you need to up the sampling rate

3815
01:57:11,439 --> 01:57:15,039
you do in the industry to find it but

3816
01:57:13,118 --> 01:57:16,639
that being said can roll it back to

3817
01:57:15,039 --> 01:57:18,880
vioxx right

3818
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:21,039
vioxx went through probably killed 50

3819
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:24,159
000 people and it took the fda five

3820
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:27,439
years to finally admit they were wrong

3821
01:57:24,158 --> 01:57:29,039
right and why is that well because uh

3822
01:57:27,439 --> 01:57:30,399
admitting they're wrong after they were

3823
01:57:29,039 --> 01:57:31,439
paid a lot of money by the

3824
01:57:30,399 --> 01:57:32,960
pharmaceutical energy to

3825
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:35,039
put that drug through is harder to

3826
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:37,520
reverse right it's just it's more

3827
01:57:35,039 --> 01:57:39,198
it's more crow to eat than you want and

3828
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:40,960
many people don't realize the fda right

3829
01:57:39,198 --> 01:57:42,319
now is governed by the pedufa act in

3830
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:44,480
1992 which

3831
01:57:42,319 --> 01:57:46,079
means about half to two-thirds of the

3832
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:47,919
revenue going into the fda comes

3833
01:57:46,079 --> 01:57:52,319
directly from the companies

3834
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:54,880
that they regulate right this is

3835
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:55,920
it's a euphemism for bribery um right

3836
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:58,560
yeah

3837
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:59,279
effectively how can that agency with a

3838
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:01,679
straight face

3839
01:57:59,279 --> 01:58:02,960
claim that they are out for the consumer

3840
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:04,560
when they're on the payroll of the

3841
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:05,679
people they're regulating

3842
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:07,119
this is going to lead to really bad

3843
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:07,840
decision making even if it has the right

3844
01:58:07,118 --> 01:58:10,000
intentions

3845
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:11,360
um and the incentives aren't there when

3846
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,560
they make a mistake

3847
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:14,479
they're going to get a bigger budget

3848
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:16,960
yeah you know so

3849
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:18,638
this is this to me is like we don't need

3850
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:20,639
this near cannabis the cannabis

3851
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:21,760
hasn't killed anybody so what does the

3852
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:23,679
the fda

3853
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:25,039
what they've already done to cannabis if

3854
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:26,719
you just look at epidiolex has made it

3855
01:58:25,039 --> 01:58:28,880
30 times more expensive yeah

3856
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:29,840
made it an isolate put into strawberry

3857
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:31,840
flavoring

3858
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:33,760
that is registered as a pesticide by the

3859
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:34,000
epa and then added in like super lows

3860
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:37,039
which

3861
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:39,920
like gives people sneakers yeah right

3862
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:40,639
into a worse drug by and and and gw has

3863
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:43,118
to kind of

3864
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:44,880
unfortunately put up with this right and

3865
01:58:43,118 --> 01:58:48,319
uw is filled with people who know

3866
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:49,920
yeah yeah know the the extracts are

3867
01:58:48,319 --> 01:58:51,599
are more effective but they can't get

3868
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:53,039
something that complicated

3869
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:54,480
through i mean they got sativex through

3870
01:58:53,039 --> 01:58:55,439
but they haven't gotten it through not

3871
01:58:54,479 --> 01:58:58,959
in the us system

3872
01:58:55,439 --> 01:59:00,960
yeah yeah and then it's dvd

3873
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:02,880
right yeah i mean um ethan russo and i

3874
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:03,679
talked about this in our interview and a

3875
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,400
little bit off

3876
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:07,920
interview too but you know the fact that

3877
01:59:06,399 --> 01:59:10,079
uh they're struggling so much with

3878
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:11,840
sativex and that if sativex does make it

3879
01:59:10,079 --> 01:59:14,639
through the us system it's

3880
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,960
it might end up being a very different

3881
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:16,480
uh

3882
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:18,000
pharmaceutical altogether than what you

3883
01:59:16,479 --> 01:59:21,039
would find in the uk

3884
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,920
or um or in spain or um things in canada

3885
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:25,519
too

3886
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:27,279
um and it it it is really interesting

3887
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:28,719
and i i agree i mean i've been following

3888
01:59:27,279 --> 01:59:31,679
gw for

3889
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:32,719
pretty much since i knew about you know

3890
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:35,679
knew about them in

3891
01:59:32,719 --> 01:59:37,439
i don't know long long time ago in the

3892
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:40,560
early 2000s or something

3893
01:59:37,439 --> 01:59:41,759
and um you know i've followed the work

3894
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,360
of several of the

3895
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:44,880
different scientists that have come and

3896
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:47,598
gone that have that have

3897
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:48,960
worked with gw and it i agree i mean it

3898
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:52,319
seems like

3899
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:54,960
as far as i can tell they understand the

3900
01:59:52,319 --> 01:59:55,679
the best way to actually apply these

3901
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,880
medicines

3902
01:59:55,679 --> 02:00:00,800
some of the research they've done is

3903
01:59:56,880 --> 02:00:00,800
actually highlighted you know that yeah

3904
02:00:01,039 --> 02:00:06,000
yeah yeah but they're having to play the

3905
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:08,479
same regulatory games as anyone else and

3906
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,920
um you know it's it's so common

3907
02:00:08,479 --> 02:00:11,279
especially in the canvas industry for

3908
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:14,158
people to bash

3909
02:00:11,279 --> 02:00:16,559
anybody that is perceived as you know a

3910
02:00:14,158 --> 02:00:18,960
a dastardly pharmaceutical company

3911
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:20,400
and hey they write the rules they they

3912
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:21,279
got to play by them you're right they

3913
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:22,638
don't blame

3914
02:00:21,279 --> 02:00:24,158
sometimes they write rules when they're

3915
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:24,639
really big i don't think gw's at that

3916
02:00:24,158 --> 02:00:26,319
scale

3917
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:27,920
no no they're not and that's something i

3918
02:00:26,319 --> 02:00:30,158
try to remind people of

3919
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:31,760
you know is one they were doing this

3920
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:33,118
work in other countries initially where

3921
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,760
they were able to do things that they

3922
02:00:33,118 --> 02:00:37,519
can't

3923
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:39,440
really do here and some of the

3924
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:41,280
products i mean sativex in particular is

3925
02:00:39,439 --> 02:00:43,118
actually a very impressive

3926
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:44,479
product when you think about it it's not

3927
02:00:43,118 --> 02:00:46,799
i think there's a misconception that

3928
02:00:44,479 --> 02:00:47,519
it's isolated thc and cbd but it's not

3929
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:49,840
it's

3930
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:51,440
it's a standardized yeah it's a

3931
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:54,800
standardized extract

3932
02:00:51,439 --> 02:00:56,399
yeah and um yeah ethan and i were

3933
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:58,159
talking about

3934
02:00:56,399 --> 02:00:59,279
they do actually a really good job

3935
02:00:58,158 --> 02:01:00,319
measuring they're measuring things that

3936
02:00:59,279 --> 02:01:02,639
the labs are measuring

3937
02:01:00,319 --> 02:01:04,399
right i think they're measuring sterols

3938
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:05,599
a host of these other compounds

3939
02:01:04,399 --> 02:01:07,679
that we're not seeing in the

3940
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:09,599
dispensaries so they have with hands

3941
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:10,319
down the best manufacturing process for

3942
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:11,920
this

3943
02:01:10,319 --> 02:01:13,679
that there is i don't i don't doubt that

3944
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,480
one bit yeah but they're getting asked

3945
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:16,079
to make they're

3946
02:01:14,479 --> 02:01:17,678
getting asked to point that amazing

3947
02:01:16,079 --> 02:01:20,479
scientific engine they have

3948
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:22,560
in the wrong direction right but tell us

3949
02:01:20,479 --> 02:01:25,359
what's the active

3950
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:25,840
yes yeah that's all they're all active

3951
02:01:25,359 --> 02:01:28,479
right

3952
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:30,000
yeah yeah yeah so it'll be interesting i

3953
02:01:28,479 --> 02:01:31,198
mean you know i would love to see in the

3954
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:34,880
united states some

3955
02:01:31,198 --> 02:01:36,479
process for getting um herbal medicines

3956
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:38,719
approved as

3957
02:01:36,479 --> 02:01:40,238
you know legitimate standardized

3958
02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:44,480
medicines and

3959
02:01:40,238 --> 02:01:46,000
you know now we have like um

3960
02:01:44,479 --> 02:01:47,759
what are they called like medical foods

3961
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:49,359
that you can get prescriptions for that

3962
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:50,159
often are usually just imported from

3963
02:01:49,359 --> 02:01:52,639
other countries

3964
02:01:50,158 --> 02:01:54,638
but uh the example i always use is like

3965
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:56,319
standardized ginkgo biloba extract that

3966
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:58,480
you can get a prescription for

3967
02:01:56,319 --> 02:02:00,559
and it has standardized amounts of you

3968
02:01:58,479 --> 02:02:02,959
know certain chemical constituents

3969
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:04,639
um but it didn't go through the you know

3970
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:07,118
it wasn't produced in the u.s

3971
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:09,359
and it it you know it's an interesting

3972
02:02:07,118 --> 02:02:11,519
process to even get it to be

3973
02:02:09,359 --> 02:02:12,799
um allowed to be used the way it is in

3974
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:13,920
the united states and it's just one of

3975
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:15,199
those things that i think a lot of

3976
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:17,520
people don't realize

3977
02:02:15,198 --> 02:02:19,678
that there are alternative ways of

3978
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:22,320
determining what is a medicine and

3979
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:23,920
how to give people um access and that a

3980
02:02:22,319 --> 02:02:24,799
lot of countries have do have some

3981
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:27,199
pretty

3982
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:28,960
decent ways of handling herbal medicines

3983
02:02:27,198 --> 02:02:30,479
and this isn't a complicated problem to

3984
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:32,719
figure out it's just a bureaucratic and

3985
02:02:30,479 --> 02:02:33,279
political problem uh to figure out in

3986
02:02:32,719 --> 02:02:35,279
this country

3987
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:36,719
is and unfortunately i think it's that

3988
02:02:35,279 --> 02:02:38,880
same process of

3989
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:40,239
um you know politics and bureaucracy

3990
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:42,079
that are forcing these

3991
02:02:40,238 --> 02:02:44,079
really odd distinctions between medicine

3992
02:02:42,079 --> 02:02:48,000
and food yeah yeah

3993
02:02:44,079 --> 02:02:49,599
yeah and uh like recreational versus

3994
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,520
medicinal is to me it's like

3995
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:52,880
mind-boggling that that people don't

3996
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:54,320
recognize that

3997
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:56,079
if you do the recreation you won't need

3998
02:02:54,319 --> 02:02:57,599
the medicine it's it's

3999
02:02:56,079 --> 02:02:59,118
right they're one in the same it's just

4000
02:02:57,599 --> 02:03:00,239
when you get into a chronic state of

4001
02:02:59,118 --> 02:03:02,479
disequilibrium

4002
02:03:00,238 --> 02:03:03,279
you might call it medicine right but

4003
02:03:02,479 --> 02:03:06,399
yeah

4004
02:03:03,279 --> 02:03:07,840
but that distinction is purely political

4005
02:03:06,399 --> 02:03:09,198
uh and it comes i don't know where it

4006
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,079
comes from it comes from some hatred of

4007
02:03:09,198 --> 02:03:13,519
people getting high

4008
02:03:10,079 --> 02:03:14,719
and yeah yet they happily to have you

4009
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:16,320
know bud light commercials all over the

4010
02:03:14,719 --> 02:03:18,800
super bowl so

4011
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:19,759
right yeah yeah i don't know it's a yeah

4012
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:22,800
it's a

4013
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:25,440
strange strange uh uh

4014
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:26,800
state of affairs interesting interesting

4015
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:28,559
um

4016
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:30,159
time and and place in history that we

4017
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:33,360
find ourselves um

4018
02:03:30,158 --> 02:03:35,039
hopefully it evolves in a uh

4019
02:03:33,359 --> 02:03:37,118
in a more favorable direction in the

4020
02:03:35,039 --> 02:03:39,840
future um

4021
02:03:37,118 --> 02:03:40,559
i i don't i now we've already gone over

4022
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:42,880
two hours

4023
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:44,800
so i'm beyond ecstatic that you've been

4024
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:47,440
willing to talk to me for this long

4025
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:48,000
um i want to give you a final platform

4026
02:03:47,439 --> 02:03:50,319
here

4027
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,238
um let people know how to learn more

4028
02:03:50,319 --> 02:03:53,679
about medicinal genomics also

4029
02:03:52,238 --> 02:03:55,598
one thing we didn't even talk about but

4030
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:57,279
is canopedia

4031
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:58,800
so where people can actually explore

4032
02:03:57,279 --> 02:04:00,880
some of the

4033
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:02,880
genetic data and even some chemotype

4034
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:04,880
data that medicinal genomics and

4035
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:06,159
and other groups have been bringing

4036
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:07,840
together so i'll just kind of give you a

4037
02:04:06,158 --> 02:04:09,198
platform here to let any

4038
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:11,039
any of our listeners know anything that

4039
02:04:09,198 --> 02:04:12,719
we haven't covered and where they can

4040
02:04:11,039 --> 02:04:14,000
find out more about your work and

4041
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:16,560
everything else

4042
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,639
yeah so um medicinal genomics we we make

4043
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:20,480
uh in addition to doing sequencing for

4044
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:21,760
for folks in the industry we make a lot

4045
02:04:20,479 --> 02:04:24,000
of tests to look for

4046
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:25,199
different genetics in the plant so thc

4047
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,840
and cbd and

4048
02:04:25,198 --> 02:04:28,879
xy testing we make assays for um testing

4049
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:30,560
those markers

4050
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:32,319
uh we have markers that look for

4051
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:33,760
fusarium and powdery mildew well

4052
02:04:32,319 --> 02:04:34,960
basically all the microbes that might

4053
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:36,719
harm the plant

4054
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:38,639
and also all the regulated microbes so

4055
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:40,560
we sell a lot of

4056
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:42,000
quantitative pcr kits into the into many

4057
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,920
of the labs that measure

4058
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,760
aspergillus and seminole and e coli and

4059
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:47,118
those things um

4060
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:49,119
so that you can find in medicinal

4061
02:04:47,118 --> 02:04:50,799
genomics the sequencing work

4062
02:04:49,118 --> 02:04:52,319
uh there's a lot of it put public on a

4063
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:53,760
site called canopedia a lot of people

4064
02:04:52,319 --> 02:04:54,880
don't know that we run that site because

4065
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:56,639
of the way it looks

4066
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:58,880
but that's that's a medicinal genomic

4067
02:04:56,639 --> 02:05:01,118
site for hosting a lot of this

4068
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:02,078
sequencing data it's serving some

4069
02:05:01,118 --> 02:05:04,639
purposes for

4070
02:05:02,078 --> 02:05:06,000
for research and also for ip there is a

4071
02:05:04,639 --> 02:05:08,159
blockchain component of that

4072
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:10,000
that will etch the time stamps that your

4073
02:05:08,158 --> 02:05:12,078
data is generated into a ledger that we

4074
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,158
can't control so if we ever

4075
02:05:12,078 --> 02:05:15,840
become evil on you you still have your

4076
02:05:14,158 --> 02:05:18,000
data recorded somewhere else

4077
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:19,760
um and that's all managed at the

4078
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,279
canopedia site and then thirdly we do

4079
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:22,400
run a scientific conference every year

4080
02:05:21,279 --> 02:05:24,078
called canmed

4081
02:05:22,399 --> 02:05:26,078
so um if you're interested in more of

4082
02:05:24,078 --> 02:05:27,359
these topics uh there will be many

4083
02:05:26,078 --> 02:05:29,599
people presenting there

4084
02:05:27,359 --> 02:05:31,359
um last year we had rafael matulum and

4085
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:32,560
uh he's come most years i think this

4086
02:05:31,359 --> 02:05:33,519
year might be a little tight for him

4087
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:34,560
because he's uh

4088
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:36,800
he's getting the age where it's hard to

4089
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:38,480
make that travel from israel but um

4090
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:40,400
uh but other folks of his caliber we try

4091
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:42,479
and bring in and have um

4092
02:05:40,399 --> 02:05:44,399
scientific discussion around uh crop

4093
02:05:42,479 --> 02:05:46,000
yield um how do you breed for better

4094
02:05:44,399 --> 02:05:47,839
crop yield how are we gonna handle

4095
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,279
um appellations is one thing that's

4096
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:50,639
coming up that we think is really

4097
02:05:49,279 --> 02:05:52,559
important for the cannabis field so we

4098
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:53,760
don't turn into a monocrop in the u.s

4099
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:55,119
yeah

4100
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:56,880
and uh and then we're also hitting

4101
02:05:55,118 --> 02:05:59,920
analytical chemistry labs and

4102
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:01,359
and uh and genomics topics so um submit

4103
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:01,760
your abstracts take a look at it it's

4104
02:06:01,359 --> 02:06:03,118
usually

4105
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:05,119
this year it's going to be in pasadena

4106
02:06:03,118 --> 02:06:07,118
down at um

4107
02:06:05,118 --> 02:06:08,319
uh at the pacific convention center i

4108
02:06:07,118 --> 02:06:10,639
think it's at the end of september

4109
02:06:08,319 --> 02:06:12,000
nice but uh it's usually around uh eight

4110
02:06:10,639 --> 02:06:14,159
hundred thousand people

4111
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,599
oh nice that's awesome i have to keep my

4112
02:06:14,158 --> 02:06:17,839
eye on that see if i can

4113
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:19,199
make my way down there i've i've never

4114
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:21,679
been but i'm also not

4115
02:06:19,198 --> 02:06:23,039
i'm not a huge i don't know i i tell

4116
02:06:21,679 --> 02:06:26,158
people i'm kind of a

4117
02:06:23,039 --> 02:06:27,599
hermit um doing this podcast and

4118
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:29,598
starting to like finally get out in the

4119
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:33,199
world has been a big challenge for me

4120
02:06:29,599 --> 02:06:36,078
i've got to like get out of my cave more

4121
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:37,919
but uh trying to make it to more

4122
02:06:36,078 --> 02:06:38,719
conferences regularly and canmed's one

4123
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:40,319
that i've

4124
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:42,158
