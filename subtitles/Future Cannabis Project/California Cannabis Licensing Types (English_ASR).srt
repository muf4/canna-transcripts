2
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,730
my name is Omar Figueroa and here is

3
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,980
Lauren Mendelssohn and I've been doing

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,528
cannabis law for almost 20 years

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,740
starting doing freedom defense and now

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:33,869
transitioning to legal compliance and

7
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:37,589
helping people getting their permits and

8
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:40,289
their licenses and the way I see the

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,170
shift in my practice is before I used to

10
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:45,869
help people escape their nightmares of

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,570
incarceration and now it's helping

12
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:50,339
people realize their dreams and you know

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,710
we got to think about what the dreams

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,510
are because the dream cannot be make as

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,558
much money as possible in a

16
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:58,979
non-sustainable

17
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:01,198
manner and there's nowhere else I would

18
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:04,829
rather be than here in Mendocino County

19
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,048
with a small farmers who have shown up

20
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:08,908
to attend this event so thank you for

21
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,580
the work you do you were doing the

22
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,280
creator's work and it's an honor to be

23
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:18,478
with you today today we're going to

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,219
discuss sourcing to sales and Lauren is

25
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,859
a brilliant attorney who has been

26
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,679
working with me for the past longer than

27
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:28,019
a year and she's extremely well-versed

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,020
in the law and the regulations and it's

29
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:33,030
a joy to be able to have an interchange

30
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,489
of ideas with somebody who is brilliant

31
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,519
so here's a legal disclaimer that we

32
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:40,709
cannot give legal advice today because

33
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:44,459
you're in the context of a presentation

34
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:46,438
with many other people it's probably

35
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,339
better for you not to ask questions

36
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,419
about your own situation but you may ask

37
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,728
hypothetical questions and then we can

38
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,129
give you hypothetical answers to those

39
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:57,929
hypothetical legal questions but we're

40
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,359
not here to give you specific advice

41
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,840
about your situation and it would be

42
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:07,109
imprudent in the extreme to be

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,239
disclosing private personal facts in a

44
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:11,159
forum like this so please don't ask any

45
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,420
questions that would reveal your

46
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:16,568
confidences and your secrets

47
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:18,250
I guess to date

48
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:19,810
Lauren will tell us what we're going to

49
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,250
talk about today briefly some of the

50
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,009
things that we wanted to touch on just

51
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,318
an introduction to the new governing law

52
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:28,120
here in California the medicinal and

53
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,599
adult use cannabis regulation and Safety

54
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,700
Act an overview of regulatory agencies

55
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,979
overview of the license types in the

56
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:39,189
supply chain and room for questions and

57
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:42,729
answers we're gonna go through a history

58
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:45,759
of cannabis laws in California in 1913

59
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:47,859
cannabis became illegal in California it

60
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,609
was the first state to prohibit cannabis

61
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:56,549
and prohibition increased when in the

62
00:02:51,610 --> 00:03:00,190
1950s mere possession was a felony in

63
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:02,500
1996 we had prop 215 and that was the

64
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:04,449
watershed legal event and I'm used to

65
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,340
shouting at judges with no microphone in

66
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:08,709
the courtroom and that explains my

67
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,719
awkwardness with the microphone but

68
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:13,120
anyway say in 1996 we had The

69
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,909
Compassionate Use Act which legalized

70
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,930
cannabis for medical use not for adult

71
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:20,889
use and it required a written or oral

72
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,890
recommendation or approval from a

73
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:27,129
physician it also gave a defense to

74
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:28,899
patients and caregivers in 2004 that was

75
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:31,209
the birth of the collective and

76
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,939
cooperative defense with Senate bill 420

77
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,849
and we also had state identification

78
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:38,680
cards for medical marijuana patients and

79
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:41,469
caregivers and you can still obtain

80
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,590
those state identification cards and use

81
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:49,750
them to get a tax break at a dispensary

82
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:51,819
in 2010 Senate bill 1440 9 was proposed

83
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,609
and it was a way to take the wind out of

84
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:57,400
Proposition 19 and it decriminalized

85
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:59,350
possession of up to one ounce it didn't

86
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,599
change the penalty it was still a $100

87
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:03,900
fine with no jail time it simply took

88
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,039
away the right to a jury trial for

89
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:11,260
misdemeanor possession of less than one

90
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:13,599
ounce in 2015 the legislature was trying

91
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:16,298
to tame the wild tiger of medical

92
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,430
cannabis and it passed first

93
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,228
mersa the medical marijuana regulation

94
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,840
Safety Act which sounds like an

95
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:25,418
infectious disease and it also set up a

96
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,159
new regulatory agency the Bureau of

97
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:30,669
medical marijuana regularly

98
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,350
bummer and this is because this

99
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,050
legislation was written in haste

100
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,030
it was rebranded as the Bureau of

101
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,150
medical cannabis regulation and the

102
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:42,279
medical cannabis regulations Safety Act

103
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:45,069
and it had a system of dual control

104
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:47,529
where you have to have a local permit in

105
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:50,199
order to get a state license and this

106
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:53,139
allowed jurisdictions to ban cannabis

107
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,000
activity it was done at the lobbying of

108
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:56,939
the League of California cities and the

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,829
California Association of counties and

110
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:01,629
they wanted to control the collective

111
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:03,669
and collectives and cooperatives that

112
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:09,120
they could not tame with the criminal

113
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:12,040
law in 2016 we had proposition 64 which

114
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,970
quasi legalized the adult use of

115
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,290
cannabis for adults 21 and over and

116
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,320
quasi legalized because it did not

117
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,760
repeal cannabis prohibition entirely

118
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,519
cannabis is not legal like coffee is

119
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,759
legal there's still many marijuana

120
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:29,829
crimes except the penalty has been

121
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,480
reduced or modified from felony to

122
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:34,209
misdemeanor from misdemeanor to

123
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,430
infraction from some infractions to now

124
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:39,009
it's legal to possess cannabis in

125
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:44,350
private it's also legal to give away

126
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:46,209
cannabis up to an ounce and in 2017 the

127
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,520
legislature at the urging of the

128
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:50,799
regulators who are saying we cannot come

129
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:53,019
up with two sets of regulations one for

130
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,730
medical cannabis one for adult use it's

131
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,889
the same product it should be it should

132
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:00,340
have the same standards decided to

133
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:02,769
consolidate both statutory regulatory

134
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:06,039
frameworks for adult and medical and it

135
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:08,109
created this new law now curse' the

136
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,350
medicinal and adult used cannabis

137
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:15,129
regulation and Safety Act and that is

138
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:17,530
the current regulatory framework that

139
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:20,500
this is the justification for all the

140
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:24,189
regulations that we're now seeing it

141
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,379
also has dual control in effect so you

142
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:29,589
must have a local permit in order to

143
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:31,629
obtain a state temporary license and as

144
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:34,259
a practical matter you also need to have

145
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:37,029
a local permit to get an annual license

146
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,389
okay so that was a great overview and so

147
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:40,799
now after you know here

148
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:43,589
that background here we are today with

149
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,780
this new male curso law and this is

150
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:47,489
governing the commercial activity now

151
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,099
you know what we're talking today is

152
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,710
about the commercial side of this mal

153
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,770
curse' didn't do away with a patient's

154
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:57,509
right to cultivate their own for their

155
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:59,639
medical needs and it also didn't do away

156
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:01,379
with an adult's right if you're over the

157
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,289
age of 21 to cold today at 6 plants

158
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,219
presidents this is specifically about

159
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,240
cannabis activity that's going to be

160
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,940
ending up on the commercial market

161
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,110
people to purchase so some key elements

162
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:16,079
of this law there are M and a license

163
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,400
types for medicinal or adult use of each

164
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,409
different type of license you're going

165
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,569
to be designated either M or a with the

166
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,610
exception of testing labs and the rules

167
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:26,610
are pretty much the same for the M and

168
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,910
the A's with the exception of potency

169
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,710
limits on edible and unmanufactured

170
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,720
cannabis products other than that the

171
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:35,579
rules are pretty much the same it's

172
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,920
possible to vertically integrate your

173
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:39,509
operation to have a cultivation license

174
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,160
and a manufacturing license and a

175
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:42,659
distribution license and a retail

176
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,689
license and different combinations of

177
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:48,240
those you just can't also hold a testing

178
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:50,069
lab license that has to be totally

179
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,319
independent and that makes sense we want

180
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,060
unbiased test results

181
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,980
there's no residency requirement like

182
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,689
there as in some other states meaning

183
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,259
you don't have to live in California to

184
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:03,930
get one of these licenses and so that's

185
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,939
not an issue some local jurisdictions

186
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,980
may have residency requirements or

187
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:09,420
residency preferences into their

188
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,390
ordinances but at the state level there

189
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,910
is not one there I mentioned these

190
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:15,959
potency limits on manufactured products

191
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,590
and we'll go into that a little bit

192
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,810
later but basically edibles and things

193
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:23,489
like tinctures any of these products

194
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:27,019
that have been manufactured with

195
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:30,269
cannabis are now capped either per

196
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:32,819
serving an edible product have to be 10

197
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:35,549
milligrams per serving you can't have

198
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,410
more than 100 milligrams per package and

199
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:40,439
that's uniform across adult and

200
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:42,240
medicinal and so there's definitely an

201
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,730
effort to try to increase that cap for

202
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,190
the medical market but that's the way it

203
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,990
stands right now and for non edible

204
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,210
other manufactured products there's a

205
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,000
cap of a thousand milligrams per package

206
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:55,310
and 2,000

207
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,480
that's for adult use in 2000 per package

208
00:08:55,309 --> 00:09:00,199
for medicinal and so we can talk more

209
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,580
about that later

210
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,170
there's lab testing requirements

211
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,150
basically any product that's sold at a

212
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:07,879
retailer has to be lab tested for

213
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:10,039
certain things and has to pass based on

214
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,090
a certain criteria

215
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,949
there's packaging and labeling

216
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,420
requirements they're pretty specific a

217
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,450
lot of information you have to fit on

218
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:19,099
this label and all products have to be

219
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,110
entered into the track and trace program

220
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,909
at the state level some counties like

221
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,460
Mendocino also have their own separate

222
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:27,709
track and trace program and this is so

223
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,090
the authorities can find out where the

224
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:32,300
product is moving if anything has been

225
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:34,490
diverted and so forth local control

226
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:36,199
means that in California here the your

227
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,970
local government really has the final

228
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,430
say on what kind of cannabis activity

229
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,200
you can do if you are in a place where

230
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:43,879
they have banned a certain type of

231
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,230
cannabis activity you can't get a state

232
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:48,559
license for it there you have to find

233
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,509
someplace else and that's or change the

234
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,669
law what do you live exactly Lobby your

235
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:55,309
local government to change the rules

236
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:57,679
which many people are doing successfully

237
00:09:55,309 --> 00:10:00,349
and it just takes people like you and I

238
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,149
and all of us to show up to the meetings

239
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,589
and and put our information you know

240
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:06,139
what we want on the agenda and speak up

241
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:11,000
at public comments and write letters and

242
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:13,610
so forth and run for office and Taxation

243
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,940
in this new law there's levels of tax on

244
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:21,320
the cultivators as well as on purchasers

245
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:26,480
and it's pretty high right now the

246
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:28,790
levels for that are $9.25 an ounce on

247
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,800
flower two dollars and seventy five

248
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:34,129
cents an ounce on trim and a dollar

249
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,870
twenty nine announced on live plant

250
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:39,289
material which has to be weighed within

251
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,470
two hours of being harvested so those

252
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:45,349
are just some of the basics now we're

253
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,190
gonna go over the main regulatory

254
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:52,450
agencies and there's three of them

255
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:55,550
depending on which type of activity that

256
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:57,560
somebody is engaging in so within the

257
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:59,990
Department of Consumer Affairs there's a

258
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:03,289
newly created agency called the Bureau

259
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,690
of cannabis control this is a successor

260
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:06,589
agency to bummer the Bureau of medical

261
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,670
marijuana

262
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:13,009
and it is led by chief Lori Ajax it's

263
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:15,199
considered the lead agency and it

264
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:18,200
regulates and licenses distributors

265
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,020
whose job it is to get from one licensee

266
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,290
to another and perform certain testing

267
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:25,220
Quality Assurance and taxation functions

268
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:27,528
retailers are the ones who have

269
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,230
interface with the public or patients

270
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:32,049
micro businesses may have interface with

271
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,639
public or patients or they could be

272
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:37,250
cultivators manufacturers and

273
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,139
distributors and then testing labs and

274
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:42,440
as Lawrence said testing labs cannot

275
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:45,289
have any other type of license it's it's

276
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,180
to basically ensure that the testing lab

277
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:53,028
has no financial interest in the outcome

278
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:55,429
of the test for cultivation we have the

279
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:56,720
Cal cannabis licensing branch and that's

280
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:59,569
within the Department of Food and

281
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,820
Agriculture and they also administer the

282
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,610
track and trace program and they also

283
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:07,310
issue processor licenses and then

284
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:10,039
manufacturing is overseen by a newly

285
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:11,779
created Bureau the manufactured cannabis

286
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:15,259
safety branch within the Department of

287
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:18,529
Public Health and they are also issuing

288
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:22,279
the new type as shared manufacturing

289
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:24,230
facility license so in addition to those

290
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,639
agencies those three agencies are going

291
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,500
to be the ones that are issuing the

292
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,330
licenses for these cannabis businesses

293
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,669
there's other agencies at the state

294
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:34,670
level that are also involved in

295
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:36,588
regulating cannabis businesses and so

296
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:40,059
they have regulations that you have to

297
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:43,190
follow enrollment programs and so forth

298
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,838
some of the more prominent ones are the

299
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,270
Department of Fish and Wildlife if you

300
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,950
are cultivator you probably hopefully

301
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:51,100
know all about the Department of Fish

302
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:53,680
and Wildlife as well as the water boards

303
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,990
they Department of Fish and Wildlife is

304
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:59,809
looking at making sure that you are

305
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:03,409
keeping streams and rivers and lakes

306
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:06,528
clear clean and keeping the wildlife

307
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:09,549
within those waterways clean and so if

308
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:12,980
your cultivator there is you need to get

309
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:14,509
have a lake in stream bed alteration

310
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,480
agreement from the Department of Fish

311
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:19,159
and Wildlife or written written notice

312
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,879
from them that one is not required based

313
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:24,350
on the specific

314
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:26,360
of your property and so and the State

315
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,930
Water Resources Control Board also has a

316
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,000
new enrollment program for cultivators

317
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:33,709
that's you can go online and fill out

318
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,509
they have an online enrollment form and

319
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,269
there's different programs for water

320
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,470
quality as well as for water rights so

321
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:40,960
you want to make sure if your cultivator

322
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,370
you're checking out the water board

323
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,470
Department of tax and fee Administration

324
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,389
they are collecting well they're there

325
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,090
that new cannabis tax that I mentioned

326
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:51,740
the distributors are going to end up

327
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,000
being the tax collectors and it's all

328
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,860
going to get back to this department of

329
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,289
tax and fee Administration if you're a

330
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,050
distributor you need to get a special

331
00:13:56,289 --> 00:14:02,480
distributor tax permit from that agency

332
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:05,029
the Department of pesticide regulation

333
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,370
has some specific there are specific

334
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:09,079
pesticides that are approved to be used

335
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,000
on cannabis and specific ones that are

336
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,040
not approved on cannabis and there's a

337
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,080
list on their website so make sure that

338
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:18,199
you are looking into that and there's

339
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:21,440
others as well now we're gonna go over

340
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:24,320
the different types of Lysa's categories

341
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,410
and there's a designation M for

342
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,900
medicinal a for adult use for each type

343
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:32,299
of license except for the laboratory

344
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:34,850
testing license those don't have any

345
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:38,149
designation and so it is possible to

346
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:42,050
have two of the same types of licenses

347
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:44,779
on the same premise M and an a license

348
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:46,939
on the same premise and there's many

349
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:49,730
businesses that have that so for

350
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,860
cultivation there's five types and it

351
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:55,310
those are based on size and there's

352
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:58,340
three main categories indoor outdoor and

353
00:14:55,309 --> 00:15:01,009
mixed light there's also a nursery type

354
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,540
license and then a processing only

355
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:06,080
license that does not authorize

356
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:09,649
cultivation but does authorize sorting

357
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:13,070
curing grading trimming for

358
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:15,860
manufacturing we see five license type

359
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:18,370
style there's the type six which is non

360
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:21,470
volatile extraction or solvent 'less

361
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:23,570
rosin technique extraction we also have

362
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,620
the type seven volatile extraction

363
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:30,589
that's often BHO extraction

364
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:32,750
interestingly winterization using ethyl

365
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:33,410
alcohol is not considered volatile

366
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,629
extraction

367
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:37,789
considered type six non-volatile

368
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:39,680
extraction and then we also have

369
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:41,778
infusion that does not authorize

370
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:45,528
extraction that authorized the

371
00:15:41,778 --> 00:15:48,019
production of cannabis Goods infused

372
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:51,409
with cannabis and then there's a

373
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:54,139
packaging and labeling license that the

374
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:56,600
state will issue and that is only for

375
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:59,629
packaging and repackaging labeling and

376
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,360
relabeling I haven't seen any state

377
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:05,778
licenses issued in those categories yet

378
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:08,720
because it takes a local government to

379
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:10,639
amend its local ordinance and issue

380
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,490
those kind of permits before the state

381
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,198
will issue a license and then the newest

382
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,899
type of license is a shared

383
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:20,929
manufacturing facility type pass license

384
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:25,339
and the way that works if somebody has a

385
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:28,128
type six type seven or type N license

386
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:30,740
they're eligible to registered as as a

387
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:34,550
shared use facility and it's a fairly

388
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:36,889
simple form two pages and once the

389
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:39,338
primary licensee is registered as the

390
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:42,589
shared use facilities then other

391
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:45,160
manufacturers can get a type as shared

392
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:47,630
manufacturing facility licensed

393
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:50,120
laboratory testing there is no

394
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:53,629
difference between medicinal or adult

395
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,269
use laboratory testing distribution

396
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:58,938
there's basically three variants the

397
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:02,740
full distributor who is responsible for

398
00:16:58,938 --> 00:17:06,379
tax collection quality assurance and

399
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:08,750
ensuring laboratory testing the self

400
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,030
distributor and that's somebody who

401
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:14,209
basically can only transport their

402
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:17,240
cannabis from themselves the licensee to

403
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,880
another licensee and then the transport

404
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:24,009
only distributor who can transport their

405
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,000
own and other licensees product the self

406
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:31,099
distribution and transport only

407
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,839
distribution licenses those do not allow

408
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:36,079
the product to get to market so they

409
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:37,730
cannot transport to retail locations

410
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,250
because otherwise there will be no

411
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,649
guarantee that the cannabis goes through

412
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,048
Quality Assurance laboratory testing and

413
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:46,879
tax collection they have to go through a

414
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:49,639
full distributor before retail

415
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,419
now retailers there's basically two

416
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,580
types of retailers the first one is the

417
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:58,370
storefront dispensary which can include

418
00:17:55,579 --> 00:18:00,589
delivery as well as on-site consumption

419
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:03,349
and that is something that gives the

420
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:05,119
storefront dispensary an edge over the

421
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:08,538
livery services yes they may have

422
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:11,079
greater operating cost but you know

423
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:13,220
something that California does allow is

424
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,928
consumption lounges and I think that's

425
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,150
something that you will see in the

426
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:19,730
future as more more local jurisdictions

427
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:22,700
are comfortable with cannabis regulation

428
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:25,640
we will see more consumption lounges and

429
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,798
more cannabis tourism and then there's

430
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,080
the delivery only retail which is

431
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:32,750
basically a delivery service and that

432
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:35,389
does not allow any storefront operations

433
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:38,720
finally we have the micro business micro

434
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:42,440
business is three or four out of the

435
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,200
following types of licenses cultivation

436
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,419
up to ten thousand square feet

437
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,759
manufacturing but no solvent or no

438
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:52,900
volatile solvent extraction only non

439
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:57,048
volatile or solvent less extraction

440
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,909
distribution and or retail and then

441
00:18:57,048 --> 00:19:02,000
finally the bureau of cannabis controls

442
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:06,169
also issues licenses for cannabis events

443
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,599
and the way that works in order to get a

444
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:10,759
license for a temporary cannabis event

445
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:12,949
which can last up to four days somebody

446
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:15,859
must first get a license to be a

447
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,590
cannabis event organiser that's a type

448
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:21,079
14 license and then with a cannabis

449
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:24,619
event organiser license you can go to a

450
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:28,129
local jurisdiction get local approval

451
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:30,288
for the cannabis event and then once you

452
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,940
have local approval the State Bureau of

453
00:19:30,288 --> 00:19:35,720
cannabis control will issue a temporary

454
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:38,538
cannabis event license High Times has a

455
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,150
cannabis event organiser licensed but

456
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:43,158
they did not get local approval and they

457
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,500
are not able to get a temporary cannabis

458
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,780
event license for their high times

459
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,839
Southern California cup starting today

460
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:52,879
and so the Bureau of cannabis control

461
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:55,928
might be engaging an enforcement action

462
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,730
they have threatened any licensees who

463
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:00,980
participate in sales at the high time

464
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,839
scope with license

465
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:08,450
listen disciplinary action against their

466
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:10,519
license here's a little flow chart that

467
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,049
shows the basic order of events

468
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:28,309
throughout these fletching I see a

469
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:31,460
question in the back yes extraction

470
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:34,730
techniques versus state do you you guys

471
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:38,210
know what Mendocino regulations are

472
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:40,549
regarding a non-volatile and solvent

473
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,470
extractions and how they compare to the

474
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:43,970
state like I've heard that for instance

475
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,420
like ice water hash or rosin or

476
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,829
something like that is doesn't require a

477
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,580
separate permit in the county of

478
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:55,490
Mendocino but on the state level saying

479
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:58,909
you need specific licensing you would

480
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:02,509
need a specific manufacturing license to

481
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:05,029
make ice water hash or rosin even if

482
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:07,369
you're not using any solvents if you're

483
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:12,019
still transforming the raw cannabis

484
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:13,759
flour into some kind of a other canopy

485
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:16,190
you're extracting in some form that

486
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,869
cannabinoids from that plant your mat

487
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,670
that's manufacturing so you need a

488
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:22,879
manufacturing permit for medicine Oh

489
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:26,570
County they are issuing non-volatile

490
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:29,740
type six permits and then you would need

491
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:31,809
to get a state license for that as well

492
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,660
did I understand your question correctly

493
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:36,980
okay great

494
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,420
so here's a flow chart that shows the

495
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,630
basic order of events throughout the

496
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:44,330
supply chain you start you know with the

497
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:47,090
flower being cultivated then it is

498
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:50,409
optional if the product might go to a

499
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:53,750
manufacturer for to be made into oil or

500
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:55,490
edibles or something of that nature it

501
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,190
then would go either straight from the

502
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:01,370
cultivator or after the manufacturer to

503
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,650
distribution but it would go by way so

504
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:06,859
in between these the distributor has to

505
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:09,650
kind of carry it from cultivation to the

506
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:11,539
manufacturing so really

507
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,639
the cultivator can have a self

508
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,348
distribution license but there

509
00:22:13,638 --> 00:22:17,928
the only licensing that's allowed to

510
00:22:15,348 --> 00:22:20,628
transport cannabis Goods is a

511
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:22,429
distributor and an employee of a testing

512
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:24,439
lab because testing lab employees have

513
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:26,629
to be transporting samples to and from

514
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,149
the testing lab so the distributors of

515
00:22:26,628 --> 00:22:31,699
any sort the three different types that

516
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:33,288
Omar just mentioned or a testing lab

517
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,119
employer the only types of licensees

518
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:38,419
that can transport the cannabis but

519
00:22:35,118 --> 00:22:40,548
anyway after at the distribution stage

520
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:43,249
really what this is indicating is where

521
00:22:40,548 --> 00:22:44,569
the lab the lab testing will occur at

522
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:46,219
that stage the distributor is

523
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:49,218
responsible for making sure that is a

524
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:51,229
range that happens the laboratory

525
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:54,259
employee will come to the distribution

526
00:22:51,229 --> 00:22:56,119
facility and will collect the sample the

527
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:57,919
dis an employee of the distributor has

528
00:22:56,118 --> 00:23:01,308
to be present this has to occur on

529
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,619
camera and the sample is collected to be

530
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:06,648
brought back to the testing lab to be

531
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:09,678
tested and and then the results will be

532
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:12,078
sent back to the distributor and only

533
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,759
after the lab testing has occurred can

534
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:19,700
it be make his way to a retail facility

535
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:22,940
yeah hi I was wondering about licensing

536
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,828
outside of having any testing lab is

537
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,558
there any licenses that you can combine

538
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:30,190
like self just you know gardening

539
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:33,200
license and distributor license or a

540
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,179
delivery and a lounge license is already

541
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,429
regulations that don't allow for

542
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:41,719
multiple for one person to hold multiple

543
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:43,369
license at this time no in 2023 I think

544
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:46,849
there's going to be like limitations if

545
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:49,488
you have the type 5 large licenses and

546
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:51,648
you'll be restricted there is a

547
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:54,528
limitation currently on the number of

548
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:58,968
medium cultivation licenses that people

549
00:23:54,528 --> 00:24:01,788
can hold and that is on there as well

550
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:04,940
you were limited to one type three

551
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:06,319
license but this is at the state level

552
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,479
that we're just talking really about the

553
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,368
state right now many cities and counties

554
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:12,469
might limit you to make let's say one

555
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:14,269
permit in this county are two permits

556
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:16,038
throughout this county per person so

557
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:17,298
this is just really the state regs that

558
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:19,638
we're going through but you always want

559
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:21,378
to check your local jurisdictions rules

560
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:24,788
as well to see if they have separate

561
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:24,788
restrictions and

562
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:30,778
I was just gonna ask about the

563
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,278
manufacturing piece so as a cultivator I

564
00:24:30,778 --> 00:24:34,470
always thought that we had to get

565
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:38,130
everything tested first before it moves

566
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:40,380
on to the next stage so it's okay then

567
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,440
to have it manufactured into pre-rolls

568
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,090
or something and then have that tested

569
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,509
because it just seems like a cost for

570
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:52,788
cultivators to turn their product into

571
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:55,230
something from the bulk flour rain or um

572
00:24:52,788 --> 00:24:57,119
designation and then have it tested and

573
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,860
you know open up all that packaging and

574
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,439
stuff sure which is why you might want

575
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:04,769
to do testing on your own just to make

576
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,509
sure that your product is is okay before

577
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,220
you go through that expense but it's not

578
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:11,490
really testing because of a fails

579
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:13,710
testing it could be destroyed yeah it's

580
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:16,470
not required that the cultivator tests

581
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:17,788
it okay it has to be tested at some

582
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,169
point before it gets to market and that

583
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:21,869
responsibilities put on the distributor

584
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:23,759
now but traditionally cultivators were

585
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:25,859
the ones to test their medicine before

586
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,389
taking it to the dispensary and then

587
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:29,729
cultivators are still probably going to

588
00:25:27,388 --> 00:25:31,829
do that even though it's not required as

589
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,899
an internal control and also because

590
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:36,000
they don't want to risk putting all this

591
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:38,459
product into the hands of a distributor

592
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,528
and then once it's in the hands of the

593
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,629
distributor it can't get to a retail

594
00:25:40,528 --> 00:25:44,878
market unless it gets a certificate of

595
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:48,418
analysis showing it passes testing and

596
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:50,339
so if it doesn't it can be remediated if

597
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,440
it can't be remediated it has to be

598
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:54,359
destroyed and then the only way to get

599
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,700
your product off farm if you don't have

600
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,859
a distributor transport only license is

601
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,720
that the distributor or the distributor

602
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:02,329
has to come to your farm and take it and

603
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:08,220
then send it to the manufacturing

604
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:10,558
facilities yes okay thank you now we're

605
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:15,440
gonna just see one more question in the

606
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:17,878
back over there what is remediation

607
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,830
consist of that's a great question that

608
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:23,699
would mean some type of further

609
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:26,369
processing in order to remove either

610
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,629
there was maybe there was some extra

611
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:28,979
chemicals in there that shouldn't have

612
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:32,490
been or something like that so may be

613
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,839
doing another X you know I'm not a

614
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,399
manufacturer so I don't know what they

615
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,069
do but they do some process by which

616
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:38,879
they're further refining the product and

617
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,470
it might

618
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,990
the second time you tested it might pass

619
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:45,630
basically but it's there circumstances

620
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,609
where you cannot remediated product and

621
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:51,480
that is dependent on basically what it

622
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:53,038
test spot negative for and so if you

623
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,899
want to come talk to us afterwards we

624
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,450
can send you you know where you can find

625
00:26:54,898 --> 00:27:05,939
those exact regs and find out more about

626
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:08,278
that yeah I know in other industries

627
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,600
we've sent products to various labs and

628
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:11,579
gotten all kinds of different results

629
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,349
sometimes they come together pretty

630
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:15,599
close and sometimes they're all over the

631
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:17,459
place and it pens on the lab and who did

632
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,638
it that day and how many drinks for

633
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:25,288
lunch and we got any feedback on this

634
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:27,538
industry's accuracy of lab testing when

635
00:27:25,288 --> 00:27:29,490
California normal conducted ring testing

636
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:32,908
which is taking the same sample to

637
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:35,700
different labs there was wildly varying

638
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:37,980
results and they also did the same

639
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,460
sample to the same lab at different

640
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,558
times

641
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,808
also with wildly varying results and

642
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:45,569
that's because the labs were not

643
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:47,388
accredited so now that the Bureau of

644
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:50,128
cannabis control is requiring

645
00:27:47,388 --> 00:27:52,439
accreditation or at least applying for

646
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:54,209
accreditation we're gonna see less

647
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,879
variance in the labs but I've definitely

648
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:59,340
heard a lot of horror stories from

649
00:27:56,878 --> 00:28:01,378
cultivators you know who were not

650
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:03,869
getting consistent results and there was

651
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:05,638
labs were manipulating test results by

652
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:08,339
drying the samples so that they would

653
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:11,969
score higher and you know if you if the

654
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:14,428
lab tends to have higher THC results

655
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,990
then more people will start going there

656
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:19,048
and so I think there's been a lot of

657
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:22,048
gaming of lab results that's more

658
00:28:19,048 --> 00:28:25,589
function of unsophisticated consumers

659
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:27,628
who equate potency in terms of THC with

660
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:29,579
quality and it's like you know with

661
00:28:27,628 --> 00:28:32,069
alcohol prohibition people wanted the

662
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:35,428
strongest huge and as we know the

663
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:37,619
strongest hooch is probably not the most

664
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:40,169
appealing when you have a choice you

665
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:42,989
know nobody goes and buys you know the

666
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:45,538
grain alcohol but you would if care if

667
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,909
alcohol was illegal and so that's I

668
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:50,099
think that's a function of cannabis

669
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:52,460
prohibition is the substitution of

670
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:54,319
potency for quality

671
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,519
and you know people were gaming test

672
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,639
results and there's a lot of

673
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:01,970
inconsistency I expect that we'll see

674
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,940
less variance in test results over time

675
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:07,460
as people do that ring testing I think

676
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,140
the Bureau of cannabis control would do

677
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,420
well to submit the same samples to

678
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,540
different labs on different days and see

679
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,340
if the results match other what huh

680
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:18,889
that's called ring testing it's just

681
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:21,019
like a term from laboratories with the

682
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,930
knowledge of the testing results not

683
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:26,000
being consistent does a cultivator have

684
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,710
the option of having another test done

685
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,900
with another facility if their crop

686
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:34,549
fails the test before it's destroyed

687
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,080
great question after a remediation yes

688
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:38,029
but the current regulations don't allow

689
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:39,859
it but it you don't have to stay with

690
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:41,930
the second with the first lab for the

691
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:44,809
second test post remediation what do you

692
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:46,370
think Ron you can test in that first

693
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:49,909
test doesn't go in the track and trace

694
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:52,879
system whereas the subsequent tests do

695
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:54,110
so as a cultivator and if you got good

696
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,030
contracts you'd want to have your

697
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:57,109
product tested so that if it gets to the

698
00:29:56,029 --> 00:30:00,079
distributor and it comes back positive

699
00:29:57,109 --> 00:30:02,209
you have some recourse would you suggest

700
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:08,179
putting that into say the agreement with

701
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:10,970
the distributor absolutely thanks very

702
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:13,539
quick overview of cultivation and you

703
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:17,990
know right now that there is no

704
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:20,559
limitation on how many specialty small

705
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:24,079
or cottage licenses somebody can stack

706
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,970
you right now the Cal cannabis

707
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,519
cultivation licensing will issue one

708
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:31,190
type three license but because there is

709
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:32,930
no limit on stacking there's been a

710
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:36,950
lawsuit filed by the Cal Growers

711
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:39,380
Association because the e I are for

712
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:43,120
these cannabis cultivation regulations

713
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:46,730
said we are not going to allow the

714
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:49,669
consolidation of cannabis cultivation in

715
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:51,920
the hands of the few and we want to have

716
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:53,769
numerous cultivators so there's current

717
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,320
pending litigation on that issue

718
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:58,940
the latest appears to be that there may

719
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:01,429
be some sort of settlement where the

720
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:04,370
future regulations will have the one

721
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:06,179
acre cap that's the hopeful view and I

722
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:09,178
hope that does happen

723
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:11,278
but right now as far as the license

724
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:13,769
types it really depends on the local

725
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,778
jurisdiction so Mendocino County and

726
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:18,179
correct me if I'm wrong there's not

727
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:20,579
issue licenses for 22,000 square feet

728
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:24,450
you know they're capped at ten thousand

729
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:27,658
square feet and that is not unlocking

730
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:30,149
the full potential of my cursor here we

731
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:33,210
are looking at the state law and the

732
00:31:30,148 --> 00:31:35,548
type three license is issued in many

733
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,240
other jurisdictions since Salinas in

734
00:31:35,548 --> 00:31:39,319
Monterey

735
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,179
all in all over Santa Barbara County

736
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:44,009
Sonoma County San Luis Obispo County and

737
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:46,649
so there's no reason why there shouldn't

738
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:50,009
be type three licenses in Mendocino

739
00:31:46,648 --> 00:31:53,008
County and it's something that is not

740
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:55,319
baked in to California law this is a

741
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:57,720
feature of the local ordinances and I'm

742
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:00,058
so happy that we're now seeing people

743
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,769
running for supervisor who understand

744
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:04,319
the cannabis industry and who are

745
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:06,899
sympathetic and who get it and who are

746
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,638
no longer like the supervisors of old

747
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:12,268
who were trying to stymie cannabis at

748
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:15,209
every turn and so the message from my

749
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:18,179
cursor and local control is if you don't

750
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:20,100
run for public office then you will be

751
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:21,509
ruled by politicians who simply don't

752
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:22,949
know what they're talking about if

753
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:28,740
you're not at the table you're on the

754
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:30,720
menu there's a type four license called

755
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,849
cultivation and that doesn't really have

756
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,038
I guess a square footage limits right Oh

757
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:37,079
in Mendocino it does in other

758
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:43,230
jurisdictions there are no limits to the

759
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:45,259
type for nursery take a question in the

760
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,259
back

761
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:52,520
you have a nursery license does that

762
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,230
mean that you can have an unlimited

763
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:59,519
range of male and female plants in order

764
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:00,569
to create seeds if they're not budding I

765
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,759
think you can yes

766
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:04,379
well the females have two bud in order

767
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:12,000
to create the seeds and what else

768
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:13,650
Mendocino and that's not baked in a

769
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,349
state law that's the current ordinance

770
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:19,530
in Mendocino County anybody see

771
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:24,079
successful nurseries they'll start

772
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:24,079
lobbying for more realistic limits I

773
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:31,950
don't know humble but if you talked

774
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,660
afterwards and I get your name I can

775
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:38,340
look into it for you and get back to you

776
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:42,330
thank you the type 5 license is not yet

777
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:44,970
available and it's at this rate is not

778
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:48,449
scheduled to be issued until 2023 and

779
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:51,539
that was a part of prop 64 so even if

780
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:56,180
some lobbyists try to like advanced a

781
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:58,289
date to 2021 or 2020 that might be

782
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,990
unconstitutional there's nothing

783
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:03,599
precluding the California Legislature to

784
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:06,120
pushing that date back or making it a

785
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,250
permanent ban on the type 5 license and

786
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:11,460
there's got to be some push back at the

787
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:13,530
legislature I I think there's got to be

788
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,260
people who are pushing to advance the

789
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:18,000
date for the type 5 license and there

790
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,060
needs to be push back to like push back

791
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,429
the date instead of 2023 what about 2028

792
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,429
another five years question back there

793
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,000
very good point because of the

794
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:37,079
workaround right like they're using like

795
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,510
same parcel and then putting many many

796
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:43,389
stacking many other types of licenses

797
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:45,399
yeah I mean maybe the point of a type 5

798
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:47,110
really is for administrative efficiency

799
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:49,929
it's much easier to get economy of scale

800
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:51,220
and a massive grow than to try to

801
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:53,800
replicate that on a whole bunch of

802
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:55,388
smaller grows and so you know somebody

803
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,900
who's looking to consolidate I think

804
00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:01,650
would want a pipe fire but you raise a

805
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,650
really good point

806
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,300
and then we also and cultivators can

807
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,940
package and label non manufactured

808
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,680
cannabis that they produce and so non

809
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:15,039
manufactured cannabis products basically

810
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:21,339
means pre-rolls what else is not

811
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:22,989
manufactured like maybe teeth yes we

812
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:29,470
break it down into eight put it in

813
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:30,579
beautiful packaging you can write yes

814
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:32,699
you just need to make sure that you

815
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:35,019
follow all the rules that apply to

816
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:36,489
packaging and labeling of cannabis

817
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:37,960
products which are actually which are in

818
00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:39,549
the regulations from the Department of

819
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,750
Public Health that's where the packaging

820
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,880
and labeling rules lets you have to kind

821
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:48,219
of cross-reference those rules to see

822
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,599
what your packaging has to be like we

823
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:50,769
just went through this here's a chart

824
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,509
you can look at it for a second talks

825
00:35:50,769 --> 00:35:53,619
about the different license types I'm a

826
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,730
lot of the graphics that we're showing

827
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,380
you up here we pulled straight from

828
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:59,170
these agencies websites all this

829
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,380
information is available for you and

830
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:02,740
there's the last slide has some links

831
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,570
okay

832
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:09,219
I'll talk about manufacturing quickly so

833
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,140
manufacturing of cannabis Goods these

834
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:12,909
operators are going to be licensed by

835
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:15,699
the Department of Public Health the

836
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:17,589
manufactured cannabis safety branch like

837
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:19,679
we you mentioned earlier they are going

838
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:22,570
to make cannabis products by way of

839
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:25,359
extractions infusions or other methods

840
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:29,200
of transforming the raw product into a

841
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,910
manufactured good extraction here means

842
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,739
separating cannabinoids from plant

843
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:34,719
material this can either be done with

844
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:36,579
solvents which can be volatile or

845
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:38,259
non-volatile basically there's a you

846
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:42,509
know likely to blow up or not likely to

847
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:45,030
blow up or mechanical methods in fusion

848
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,070
is using plant material or concentrates

849
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,900
to create a cannabis product so let's

850
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,220
say you're making edibles you buy

851
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,110
cannabis oil that's already been

852
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:54,299
extracted it's oil you're gonna put it

853
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:56,789
into your cookie dough you are doing an

854
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,039
infusion and then there's packaging

855
00:36:56,789 --> 00:37:01,739
which is putting finished Canada's

856
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:03,059
products into a container and marking

857
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:04,649
them up for sale and so if you have a

858
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:06,480
packaging license from the Department of

859
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:09,780
Public Health you can package and label

860
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,340
other people's products for them and now

861
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,560
there's we talked about this earlier the

862
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:16,230
shared manufacturing facilities licenses

863
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:18,809
that are now available hopefully though

864
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:22,349
that will make licensing feasible for

865
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:23,789
more a mom-and-pop smaller operators who

866
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:24,809
can't afford a commercial kitchen of

867
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:28,199
their own they can pull their resources

868
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:29,759
now hopefully so I'm excited to see when

869
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:31,889
those start being issued

870
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,920
they started accepting applications for

871
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:37,710
them and we also talked earlier about

872
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,480
the THC limits on edibles and other

873
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,269
manufactured products so we don't need

874
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,369
to go over that again so there's some

875
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:45,929
regulate this is not part of the law

876
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:47,909
it's part of the manufacturing

877
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:50,219
regulations issued by the manufacturer

878
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:53,279
cannabis safety branch and basically for

879
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:54,689
packaging cannabis manufacture cannabis

880
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,600
products they cannot resemble

881
00:37:54,690 --> 00:38:00,119
traditional food packaging the packaging

882
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,339
has to be opaque so no more of those

883
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,869
beautiful see-through containers where

884
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,450
you can see what you're actually buying

885
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:10,369
and this is a great example of a

886
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:14,159
regulation that is onerous to the

887
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:16,289
industry products must also be packaged

888
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:18,179
before being released to the distributor

889
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:21,779
this is for manufactured cannabis

890
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:23,519
products so the distributors don't

891
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:27,480
really have the facilities or so the

892
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:30,630
mcsp thinks to conduct sterile packaging

893
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:33,119
operations the packaging must also be

894
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:34,740
tamper evident and child resistant and

895
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,539
that's why we've seen a proliferation of

896
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:39,269
wasteful packaging in the cannabis

897
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:43,289
industry and it must be resealable if

898
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:45,889
there are multiple servings labeling the

899
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:49,050
primary panel has to include the product

900
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:51,569
identity the THC conduct and then the

901
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:54,030
universal symbol which we see on the

902
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:56,068
right it is meant to identify the

903
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:59,400
products as originating in

904
00:38:56,068 --> 00:39:02,518
California and to the turd diversion and

905
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,798
detect interstate commerce in California

906
00:39:02,518 --> 00:39:06,598
cannabis there's also an information

907
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:09,440
panel which includes a list of

908
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:14,130
ingredients and a warning statement and

909
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:17,278
the universal identifier the product

910
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:20,539
cannot be referred to as candy so no

911
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:25,739
more what's gonna happen a cookie since

912
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:27,989
that's C and they cannot be attractive

913
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:33,088
to children okay

914
00:39:27,989 --> 00:39:34,798
distribution so distributors are they

915
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:37,170
play a really important role in this new

916
00:39:34,798 --> 00:39:38,998
supply chain that's been created you

917
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:41,130
have to have a distributor in order to

918
00:39:38,998 --> 00:39:42,659
transport products between licensees

919
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,969
there has to be a distribution license

920
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:46,409
at least once in there it has to go

921
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:47,369
through a distributor if not more than

922
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:48,808
once

923
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:51,269
so they're licensed by the Bureau of

924
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:52,949
cannabis control as we mentioned they

925
00:39:51,268 --> 00:39:54,538
arranged for lab testing they're

926
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:56,338
checking for proper packaging and

927
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:57,959
labeling they're also collecting the

928
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:59,759
taxes on both ends so they're going to

929
00:39:57,958 --> 00:40:02,940
be collecting the cultivation tax from

930
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:05,579
the cultivator or in the instance where

931
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,869
it goes straight to a manufacturer they

932
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:10,079
might have to collect that cultivation

933
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:12,119
tax or manufacturer or they're also and

934
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,269
they're gonna also collect the excise

935
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:17,309
tax from the retailers and that's not a

936
00:40:15,268 --> 00:40:20,218
tax on the retailer's but the retailer's

937
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:22,410
collect it from the customers and

938
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:24,929
distributors connect as wholesalers they

939
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:26,190
can have operate storage facilities if

940
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:28,078
they want they can you know just do

941
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,208
storage for other operators or other

942
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,519
distributors they can package and label

943
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:35,969
dried cannabis but not manufactured

944
00:40:32,518 --> 00:40:37,528
cannabis products and like I said all

945
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:38,880
cannabis and cannabis products must pass

946
00:40:37,528 --> 00:40:41,130
through a distributor before being sold

947
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,019
to a customer anyone can apply for a

948
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:45,509
distributor license except testing labs

949
00:40:43,018 --> 00:40:47,098
or in an earlier iteration of the law

950
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,929
distributors had to be totally

951
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:50,369
independent but that has you know since

952
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:51,778
been done away with

953
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:53,910
we mentioned earlier the three different

954
00:40:51,778 --> 00:40:57,509
types full distribution self

955
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:59,940
distribution and transport only and as

956
00:40:57,509 --> 00:41:01,528
well as the fact that distributors have

957
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,999
to register with the Department of tax

958
00:41:01,528 --> 00:41:07,170
and fee Administration for this special

959
00:41:02,998 --> 00:41:09,389
cannabis tax permit there is no tax on

960
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:11,490
distributors at the state level

961
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:14,759
different cities and counties might

962
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:16,559
impose attacks on either all operators

963
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,690
or certain operators at different rates

964
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:21,809
I believe in Mendocino counties they

965
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:24,780
have a tax on all operators at the same

966
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:26,639
rate yet with 2.5 yeah 2.5 percent no

967
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,530
matter what type of operator you are in

968
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,389
Mendocino County but nothing at the

969
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:32,940
state level directly on distributors I

970
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:35,670
personally went to you know a licensed

971
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:37,950
retailer you know in early January and

972
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:41,010
it was close to a 40 percent effective

973
00:41:37,949 --> 00:41:42,509
tax rate on my my purchase yeah so um

974
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:45,390
there is an effort in Sacramento right

975
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:48,570
now there's a bill to lower the taxes

976
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:50,489
you know and hopefully the effect will

977
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:52,920
be lowering taxes on operators and the

978
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:54,629
consumers so we'll see I don't know how

979
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,639
far along that's gotten testing

980
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:58,260
laboratories are licensed by the Bureau

981
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,730
of cannabis control which is kind of a

982
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,050
surprise because initially they were

983
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:04,139
licensed by the Department of Public

984
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:06,840
Health which is the logical agency to

985
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:09,150
regulate testing labs but the bureau I

986
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:11,820
think wanted to have more control so

987
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:15,440
that they could adjust the numbers and

988
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:17,190
it wouldn't be set more inflexibly by

989
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,250
scientists at the Department of Public

990
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:23,490
Health the testing labs have to be

991
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:25,679
independent of other licenses so if you

992
00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:27,509
have a testing laboratory license you

993
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:29,969
can only have testing laboratory

994
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:32,100
licenses if you're an employee of a

995
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:34,019
testing lab you can only work for

996
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:36,989
testing labs you cannot work for other

997
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:39,719
licensees there is a provisional or

998
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:41,699
temporary testing license those are for

999
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:43,579
labs that meet all the requirements but

1000
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:46,289
there are waiting their accreditation

1001
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:51,299
pursuant to the international standards

1002
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:53,309
organization and one 702 five sampling

1003
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:57,420
is required and the minimum or the

1004
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:59,090
maximum batch size is 50 pounds and so

1005
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,300
if there's like a thousand-pound

1006
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:05,190
transaction it must be broken into

1007
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:08,060
twenty fifty-pound batches and each

1008
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,800
batch must individually passed testing

1009
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:12,929
there's many required tests for

1010
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,320
cannabinoids foreign material heavy

1011
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:19,349
metals microbial impurities mycotoxins

1012
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:21,360
moisture content residual pesticides so

1013
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:23,519
many tests are required this is not

1014
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:27,150
required of wine it's not required of

1015
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:29,789
any other agricultural commodity I mean

1016
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:31,230
I think in retrospect in retrospect it's

1017
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:34,019
good that we can get all this like

1018
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:37,050
fine-grained detail information about

1019
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:38,429
cannabis because future archaeologists

1020
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:42,390
are going to look at all this data to

1021
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:44,759
see the state of pollution on earth and

1022
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:48,750
the testing will be faced in throughout

1023
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:51,930
2018 and the certificate of analysis is

1024
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:55,769
what the testing lab really issues when

1025
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:58,230
a sample passes testing and so if you

1026
00:43:55,769 --> 00:44:01,559
are a distributor or manufacturer or a

1027
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:03,719
cultivator you want the lab to issue the

1028
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:07,380
certificate of analysis that is the good

1029
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:09,299
to go to retail piece of paper without a

1030
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:12,210
certificate of analysis the product

1031
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:14,910
cannot be transported to a retailer if a

1032
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:16,170
dispensary still has existing inventory

1033
00:44:14,909 --> 00:44:21,359
that didn't have to go through the

1034
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:23,730
testing requirements after July July 1st

1035
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:26,400
of this year on they it would it would

1036
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:28,139
all it will all require a certificate of

1037
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,559
analysis which means it has to be

1038
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:34,199
collected by by the test by a

1039
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,420
distributor again and then go to testing

1040
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:38,969
so we're in this brief transition period

1041
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,619
where basically a man a licensees can

1042
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:42,059
work with each other back and forth and

1043
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:44,400
it doesn't matter but that's all gonna

1044
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:47,009
stop everything actually has to be a

1045
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,680
test and starting on July you know first

1046
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:51,450
so putting all that aside we're just

1047
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,659
giving you what the rules are for the

1048
00:44:51,449 --> 00:44:56,849
regular period not the transition period

1049
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:58,109
so kind of wrapping up retailers are

1050
00:44:56,849 --> 00:44:59,069
licensed by the Bureau of cannabis

1051
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,930
control this is what we took on a

1052
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:04,170
dispensary they're not called retailers

1053
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:06,059
and this includes sales of cannabis

1054
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:09,210
cannabis products either at a storefront

1055
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:11,070
location or by delivery dispensaries

1056
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:13,650
retailers can no longer package and

1057
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:14,700
label products there on-site they can't

1058
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:16,680
make the pre-rolls there anymore

1059
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:19,319
everything has to come prepackaged and

1060
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:21,989
ready to be sold when it arrives at the

1061
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,670
retailer they can conduct sales

1062
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:24,689
exclusively by deliverer if they want so

1063
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:26,280
mobile

1064
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:28,079
you know retailers are okay at the state

1065
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,550
level and a lot of cities and counties

1066
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,380
they're not so you want to make sure

1067
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:33,300
you're checking your local rules and the

1068
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,730
retailer's collect the state excise tax

1069
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,930
from the customer and

1070
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:39,949
make sure that gets paid back to the

1071
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:40,969
distributor and then they are no that's

1072
00:45:39,949 --> 00:45:42,500
all good so that it's gonna make sure

1073
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:44,469
that tax collection and this has to be

1074
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:47,539
and they have to display on the receipt

1075
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:50,000
that the excise tax has been included in

1076
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:51,889
the amount there's rules about how they

1077
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,409
have to display that to the customer of

1078
00:45:51,889 --> 00:45:56,289
your retailer so micro-businesses we

1079
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:59,059
said has to be three are the for

1080
00:45:56,289 --> 00:46:04,608
cultivation manufacturing non-volatile

1081
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:07,340
distribution or retail so there's event

1082
00:46:04,608 --> 00:46:09,739
organiser licenses which you need to get

1083
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:13,100
in order to get a temporary cannabis

1084
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:15,829
event license and so the event license

1085
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:18,170
is something for example the Emerald cup

1086
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:19,909
hopefully you know we're all hoping this

1087
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:22,760
year they will get a temporary cannabis

1088
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:24,259
event license and but first someone

1089
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,970
behind-the-scenes has to get their event

1090
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,740
organiser license and it has to be

1091
00:46:25,969 --> 00:46:29,149
approved by your local jurisdiction so

1092
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:32,839
that's what they did not do properly

1093
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:34,880
down in San Bernardino and you can have

1094
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,920
cannabis sales there but all other one

1095
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,349
has to be a retailer so it you can't

1096
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,730
just have it a retailer license to be

1097
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:43,039
selling at one of these temporary

1098
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:45,199
cannabis events and there's no

1099
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,779
consumption of alcohol or tobacco on the

1100
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:51,439
premises and it can only occur as of

1101
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:54,350
right now at a district agricultural

1102
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,789
Association or at a fairground to one of

1103
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:58,159
these County er State Fairgrounds so

1104
00:46:55,789 --> 00:47:01,820
here's a map of the different california

1105
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:04,460
affairs there's an assembly bill 2020

1106
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:07,280
that would lift this restriction and

1107
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:15,320
allow cannabis events to occur anywhere

1108
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:17,990
that the local jurisdiction permits so

1109
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,220
you some of you might be wondering what

1110
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:20,479
happened to the collective and

1111
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:22,489
cooperative law you thought it was good

1112
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,599
until next year you thought you were

1113
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:25,069
still protected under that

1114
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,699
so basically collectives and

1115
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:30,470
cooperatives if you are truly part of a

1116
00:47:28,699 --> 00:47:33,649
collective or cooperative as it is

1117
00:47:30,469 --> 00:47:35,899
defined here on this you know little

1118
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:37,849
page and in the law this is a handout

1119
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:40,340
from a hero of cannabis control correct

1120
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:42,858
unless that is the case you need a

1121
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:45,980
license to be doing commercial cannabis

1122
00:47:42,858 --> 00:47:47,869
activity simply being part of a

1123
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:49,579
collective or cooperative it'll be

1124
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:52,700
you know it could be a defense in court

1125
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:54,740
against a criminal prosecution but it's

1126
00:47:52,699 --> 00:47:57,980
not going to protect you against the

1127
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:59,808
civil penalties of you know operating a

1128
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:02,240
cannabis business without the proper

1129
00:47:59,809 --> 00:48:03,740
license basically so even if you're part

1130
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:05,598
of a collective or cooperative chances

1131
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:08,209
are you still need a state license for

1132
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,869
what you're doing and the handout from

1133
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:13,699
the Bureau of cannabis control has the

1134
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:15,470
weasel words I would call it at the end

1135
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:17,419
it says you have to comply with all

1136
00:48:15,469 --> 00:48:19,098
applicable local rules and ordinances

1137
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,809
for operating a cannabis collectible

1138
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:23,509
cooperative in that local jurisdiction

1139
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:26,240
so if you're in a band jurisdiction you

1140
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:27,980
have to comply with a ban and that's

1141
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:30,798
what the bureau is saying commercial

1142
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:33,230
cannabis activity has a incredibly broad

1143
00:48:30,798 --> 00:48:34,909
definition under the medicinal adult to

1144
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:37,699
use cannabis regulation and Safety Act

1145
00:48:34,909 --> 00:48:40,429
and so it makes it difficult to use the

1146
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:42,259
collective or cooperative workaround to

1147
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:44,118
engage in commercial cannabis activity

1148
00:48:42,259 --> 00:48:48,920
without a license that's what the bureau

1149
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:50,210
calls unlicensed operators licensees can

1150
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,829
only conduct commercial cannabis

1151
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:53,690
activity with other licensees so how do

1152
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:56,509
you find other licensees once you have a

1153
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:59,480
license this next slide shows you you

1154
00:48:56,509 --> 00:49:00,769
need to search for licensees at least

1155
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,568
one would do it is through these

1156
00:49:00,768 --> 00:49:04,308
agencies the licensing agencies have

1157
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:05,748
websites and you can search for other

1158
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:07,819
people who've gotten their license so

1159
00:49:05,748 --> 00:49:09,919
far you can search by county you can

1160
00:49:07,818 --> 00:49:11,989
