[Music]

2
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:22,049
all right so going back to somebody was

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,278
asking about trends earlier so of course

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,689
as you see in every other state and

5
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,429
actually you know you would asked about

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,320
us versus the rest of the states well

7
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,230
California versus the rest of the states

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,270
incidentally even in when California was

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,189
only medical and in states that are only

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,070
medical you're actually seeing similar

11
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:39,689
trends and yes there's slight variations

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,189
between the states but what it tells us

13
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,799
is the consumer the cannabis consumer

14
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:45,269
ultimately state-by-state or

15
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,349
internationally behaves more similarly

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,670
than they do differently

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,149
so ultimately what are the turns that

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,679
we're saying well so we're of course

19
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,870
seeing we're seeing flower decreased

20
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,030
steadily and quickly right so at the

21
00:00:54,869 --> 00:01:04,378
beginning of 2017 in California flower

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:06,329
was roughly 53% right that's a great

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,600
question pause that's a great question

24
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:10,920
let's give up today that's a great

25
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,429
question let's get back to that I love

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,618
that question

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,540
um I've actually thought it to myself

28
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:25,920
and ever voice Ted but uh but you're

29
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:27,840
seeing so I think but yeah so I think q4

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,780
and maybe November was the first time

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,329
that that flower dropped below 50% in

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,859
California right so shocking and then

33
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:36,899
the major dramatic drop that we saw was

34
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,578
between December to January where flower

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,880
dropped about six points I think 49 to

36
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:44,149
43 percent more 4842 a drop to drop

37
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,149
significantly

38
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:48,929
right so great question so one of the

39
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:51,059
main reasons so what what so I mean of

40
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,759
course the launch of the adult use

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,899
market and and what that's telling you

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,269
right I mean with the with the launch of

43
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,728
the adult use market and with that comes

44
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:01,978
regulations compliance taxes increase in

45
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:04,769
price at retail right and for heavy

46
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,629
flower consumers medical consumers in

47
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:07,978
the prop 215 world who are accustomed to

48
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:09,710
having bought their flower at a certain

49
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,770
price point for the last

50
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,969
two three five ten years they're walking

51
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,140
in a dispensary January first and

52
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:17,150
they're like oh hell no I'm not putting

53
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:20,329
those prices right and so we did see a

54
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,560
lot of the that you know you saw we all

55
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,660
know that a lot of the medical users

56
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,039
left the legal market altogether because

57
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,289
this is California and everybody knows

58
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,769
how to purchase cannabis not at a

59
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:33,409
dispensary if you are so inclined but

60
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,020
but so so of course you see flower drop

61
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:38,329
out more significantly than other

62
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:41,120
packaged consumer or new consumer

63
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,070
oriented products edibles vapes topicals

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,300
teachers so with the launch of the adult

65
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:46,969
US market right we're saying the new

66
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,620
adult use user come in so my mom who I

67
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:50,180
talked about earlier my chardonnay mom

68
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,009
cousin with two kids right a 40 year old

69
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,150
female with two kids there another one

70
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:58,579
on the way congratulations and and like

71
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,689
any minute now actually and so so so

72
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,340
this consumer right they're not buying

73
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:03,169
flour they don't know what to do with

74
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,180
flour right they're buying something

75
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:08,179
more familiar to them tinctures creams

76
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,830
lotions you know blue bit chocolate

77
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,810
covered blueberries right I mean mints

78
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,980
these are the types of ter exactly so

79
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,620
these these are all you know in lower

80
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:17,389
dose from entry-level products right and

81
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,009
so that was of course one of the major

82
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:19,939
reasons we saw flour lose significant

83
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:22,519
share to these other product categories

84
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:23,900
we saw that happen now incidentally

85
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,420
right where we would expect to see

86
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:30,319
another dramatic share share change

87
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:32,329
right um in categories we saw sorry I'll

88
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,979
take a step back we saw flour continue

89
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,840
to lose share month over month no

90
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:37,219
surprise with as the launch of the as

91
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,349
the adult use market continued to launch

92
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:41,199
in the new adult use user continued to

93
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:43,579
come into the dispensary

94
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,199
what's interesting was between June and

95
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,719
July where we'd expect to see the share

96
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,849
of flour continued to drop we actually

97
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:53,060
saw the share of flower creep back up

98
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:53,780
right now let's think about that so July

99
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,370
first

100
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,909
what happened faced you testing right

101
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,530
with phase 2 testing you know if you

102
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,879
think about this up yeah I mean if you

103
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,530
just you think about the supply chain

104
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,629
right I mean the flower you know as you

105
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,250
move down this barrier exactly of less

106
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:09,530
we have less variables introduced that

107
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,120
are likely to cause the products to Pat

108
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,949
to not pass testing right I mean flour

109
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,569
is the rawest form of the product and

110
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:17,000
the supply chain the most likely to pass

111
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:19,219
testing and so there was an abundance of

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,379
flour available on the market and a lot

113
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,300
of the packaged products were not

114
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:23,779
succeeding past making it through

115
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,340
testing

116
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:27,500
in a timely enough manner not ready

117
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,459
enough July first and so dispensaries

118
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,230
we're all picking up picking up their

119
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:31,849
phones calling their flower their major

120
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,009
flower suppliers right and of course

121
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,450
these flower suppliers in some instances

122
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:37,430
the big guys they weren't able to double

123
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,560
their orders for every dispensary and so

124
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,930
you saw tons of small boutique local

125
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,930
flower brands pop into the market in

126
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,370
July with a hundred 150 even even a half

127
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,689
a million dollars in sales folks that

128
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,800
weren't doing any volume before then

129
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:53,360
because what would you say that you're

130
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,030
seeing like on the license side are you

131
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,430
seeing a huge influx of new brands

132
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:01,119
you're seeing the same licenses being

133
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,120
used baby

134
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,199
yeah what do you think you know really

135
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,120
what we're seeing is trends we've seen

136
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,829
in every state you know Colorado's a

137
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,720
more mature market at this point and

138
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:13,099
going back to your point I did want to

139
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,290
make this point so I don't think it's

140
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,360
just a pricing issue when it comes to

141
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,580
flower and the drop in flower I think it

142
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,949
in general is the availability of

143
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:25,969
products you know once direct sales

144
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:29,229
kicked off in Colorado in 2014 in 2016

145
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:31,490
we saw the same shift from flower to

146
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,870
vaping equipment and everything else

147
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,060
like that and it's just because it's

148
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,189
more readily available more educated

149
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,319
consumers they start to learn they go to

150
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:42,110
their shop the third fourth time they're

151
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:45,349
more open to starting new products I

152
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:47,449
mean we right we've seen the same same

153
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,610
thing happen this year in Canada as well

154
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:54,379
they went from flower being the top

155
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:56,090
bottom now on the license side and the

156
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:59,629
trends that we see in California

157
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:03,139
specifically are several I would say

158
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:06,259
vertical integration is key to a lot of

159
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,389
these businesses being able to yeah yeah

160
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:11,990
being able to stack those licenses and

161
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:14,990
in control on the other side with

162
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,180
outdoor growing this is a big trend is

163
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,870
stacking licenses and growing farms

164
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,420
bigger and bigger and overall I think on

165
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,780
the on the cultivation side there's

166
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:30,590
probably two outdoor licenses too one

167
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:33,799
indoor license in this state the vast

168
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:36,369
majority of licenses colter on the

169
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,050
cultivation side are in Santa Barbara

170
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:42,920
Mendocino and Humboldt County Santa

171
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:45,290
Barbara Santa Barbara is the one County

172
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,590
with the most cultivation licenses it's

173
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,930
somewhere around 800 of those 800 it's

174
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:52,729
only a handful of businesses that that

175
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,810
hold these licenses and they've stacked

176
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,810
these licenses

177
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,939
across the u.s. it varies greatly

178
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:05,069
because in states like Vermont you're

179
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,389
not gonna be growing outdoor because

180
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:11,038
you're only going to have one harvest a

181
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:13,639
year right so indoors big they're on the

182
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:18,300
East Coast we see large scale industrial

183
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:20,250
indoor growing in California I would say

184
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,090
the vast majority again it's probably

185
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,759
two to one

186
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:26,668
outdoor compared to indoor growing and

187
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,680
and really as far as indoor grows the

188
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:32,698
vast majority of from here in LA County

189
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,530
outside of LA County it's almost you

190
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:38,340
know you can just assume it's they're

191
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:41,099
growing outdoor about where do I see

192
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:43,589
flower bottoming out and it's that's

193
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,620
that's I mean I think that I think the

194
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:49,079
question there is more so on the supply

195
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,750
side even because how crafty our

196
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:54,418
supplier is going to get with how they

197
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:58,288
deliver and package flower products and

198
00:07:54,418 --> 00:08:00,629
and effort into branding and telling the

199
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:03,959
story of the humble grower and making

200
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:05,279
the end consumer care about the flower

201
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,810
they're consuming right I think that's

202
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,418
the major question for me on the flower

203
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,918
side is is you know I think Humboldt is

204
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:13,259
gonna actually be dry whether or not

205
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,728
Humboldt survives I think will drive a

206
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,969
lot of the flower availability on our

207
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:20,219
market and yeah the branding that comes

208
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:23,190
with it yeah I think it all comes back

209
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,349
to branding right everything in a

210
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:27,598
capitalist society that allows you to

211
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:29,490
actually interact with people and bring

212
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,680
people on and try to sell your product

213
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,599
to them you have to build your brand you

214
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,500
have to cultivate that brand you have to

215
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,390
nourish it as well and yes and I think

216
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,979
that's something that some real issue

217
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:43,860
that Humboldt is dealing with the right

218
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,420
now of you guys watch South Park in the

219
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,778
Big South Park fan he's seen like last

220
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:50,189
week tegrity farms is Stan Marsh doing

221
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,189
out there yeah he left the city and he

222
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:57,640
started his own cannabis bar

223
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:59,200
is it so integrity Farms and he had

224
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,960
jeweling right you know the jewing

225
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,830
epidemic what's going on and that's

226
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:08,350
that's real right and so a part of the

227
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,000
episode this guy from big vapes comes

228
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,310
out there the big vape industry he tries

229
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,980
to get extracts from Stan to get his

230
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:18,279
company to fill these jewel pots back

231
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,560
Sarah and but he kept on talking about

232
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,720
there's no Tegrity in that something

233
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:27,039
that we're really dealing with right now

234
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,750
do you sell out completely and go into

235
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,349
the vaping industry where it's

236
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,210
everything is smoke and mirrors or do

237
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,370
you still have integrity of the plant we

238
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,290
still appreciating the trichomes the

239
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,500
different colors the different actual

240
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:42,699
terpenes not added back in like where

241
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,970
you end that where does the culture

242
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:49,720
actually meet industry and can they

243
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,940
truly coexist in the future well I mean

244
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,670
look at alcohol alright you know

245
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,280
everybody there's Bud Light and then

246
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:59,139
there's whatever craft beer you want to

247
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,959
talk about and there's a marketplace for

248
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:04,419
all of those products whether you're you

249
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,769
know midscale price-wise you're you're

250
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:07,839
not looking for something too great but

251
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:10,240
you want quality for the price you can

252
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,720
pay then then there are options for you

253
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,460
certainly on the the cheap side there's

254
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,750
there's plenty of that as well be a

255
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,639
product and brand for every consumer

256
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,440
segment right exactly

257
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,029
you know and going back to the license

258
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,950
is the one thing that that I'm

259
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:26,379
interested to see in California and the

260
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:29,140
one trend that that I've seen in in

261
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:31,990
States particularly Washington and

262
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:33,759
Oregon on as far as the licensing size

263
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,560
initially when those two states were

264
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,889
getting off the ground they over

265
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:41,229
licensed cultivators and didn't have the

266
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:43,029
consumer market to sell all of that

267
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,300
product now we see the wholesale price

268
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:47,259
is absolutely tanked in those states

269
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:49,120
Colorado is a little bit different it's

270
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:59,139
sort of leveled off and

271
00:10:49,120 --> 00:11:01,778
gained pretty nice in Oregon right it's

272
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:04,240
crazy in our averages I think our

273
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:09,159
average in the data is for five dollars

274
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:13,509
ago no 100% your price retail and and

275
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:16,689
when we look at again California I kind

276
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:19,120
of see the same thing in this state that

277
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,520
I did see in Washington and Oregon where

278
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,200
they're the the majority of licenses out

279
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,509
there I mean there's somewhere around

280
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,580
fifty four hundred active licenses now

281
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:31,450
two-thirds of those are cultivation

282
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:34,420
licenses we have 500 retail legal state

283
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,610
license retail shops in this state so

284
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:38,229
there's obviously it's top-heavy on the

285
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,419
cultivation side we'll see what happens

286
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,870
on the manufacturing the one wild card

287
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:45,778
in this scenario is delivery because I

288
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,909
mean Oregon has it to a smaller extent

289
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:50,860
Washington doesn't happen at all so I'm

290
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:53,379
excited to see what consumer trends

291
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,300
happen as far as visiting your retail

292
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,789
shop brick-and-mortar are you calling

293
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:59,979
Speedway and especially when it comes to

294
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:03,519
my mom and my chardonnay mom cousin I

295
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,750
mean that well it falls directly into

296
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,639
our lap because I mean we work with

297
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,970
almost 1200 dispensaries nationwide

298
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,669
delivery services and brands what we've

299
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,500
seen the data that we've seen points

300
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:16,629
directly to women not wanting to go to

301
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,330
dispensaries yeah so some pretty cool

302
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:20,500
data we see our online orders are

303
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:23,139
significantly higher from women women

304
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,120
are more informed shoppers they spend

305
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:28,360
more time actually looking at the

306
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,580
product descriptions spend a bit on

307
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,440
average I want to get bad data right

308
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,509
here with my team right there say about

309
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,839
like 20 percent longer than men do

310
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,838
online

311
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:44,370
exactly

312
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,920
so the women are I mean so the one thing

313
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:49,799
that we do see dying is like the sash

314
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:50,370
culture that we have in California I

315
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:53,819
will miss it

316
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,889
you know I will but it doesn't sell

317
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,690
which is which is very very interesting

318
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:58,980
I see some of these new players once any

319
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,690
names I see some new players in the game

320
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,430
they're trying to go back to that

321
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,160
they're trying to go back to the TNA and

322
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:08,250
all of their advertisements that sell

323
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:11,219
right because that sells to men and men

324
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:14,370
don't buy it sells to the metal put it

325
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,899
but yeah and itself to the men it sells

326
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,250
to the men that are already going into

327
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:19,529
the shop and buying like you're all

328
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,000
marketing to the same people that are

329
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,559
already buying the product I mean

330
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,960
there's you know from the data we know

331
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,079
to in California this is from her yeah

332
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,000
no no I mean listen oh so two things um

333
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,830
so we do consumer surveys as well as the

334
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,509
retail tracking data right in our

335
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,530
consumer surveys in California we

336
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:36,090
fielded one earlier this year we're

337
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:39,059
currently feeling another and we filled

338
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:41,820
it one last year the number last year

339
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:43,469
23% of California adults of over 21 were

340
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,120
consumers that's defined as people who

341
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,149
have said yes to consuming over the

342
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,889
plastic over the past six months that

343
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:54,600
number has since in the last year gone

344
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:57,449
up to 29% and the rest of the pie is

345
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,790
made up of 38% acceptors people who are

346
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,890
not open to consuming sorry excuse me

347
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:03,089
who don't currently consume but are open

348
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:04,199
to consuming and then rejecters who are

349
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,170
not open to consuming but are not

350
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,030
necessarily against it that 38% that's

351
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:10,379
people who want who are open to

352
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:12,860
consuming but don't currently yet

353
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:15,360
consume that is that should be

354
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,250
everybody's target market right I mean

355
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,590
that is 38% of California and adults

356
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,379
over 21 that aren't shopping at a

357
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,929
dispensary or delivery service yeah

358
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:26,178
I agree with Rico's point earlier is

359
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:28,788
that I mean for a lot of that sesh

360
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:30,858
culture you're advertising to the

361
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:32,688
consumers you already have yes there

362
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:35,629
there aren't a lot of brands out there

363
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:37,368
that are going after that undecided

364
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:39,859
consumer that's looking to make a

365
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:41,949
decision I have seen it a little bit on

366
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:45,199
the brain inside as far as marketing

367
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:48,738
products specific towards women I just

368
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,328
think it's been done poorly in a lot of

369
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:51,499
ways yeah we've seen a lot of that see a

370
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:53,568
lot of stuff that's being marketed

371
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:56,149
towards women I don't know we don't have

372
00:14:53,568 --> 00:14:58,848
enough data to know how well that is

373
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:00,499
doing yet we were a couple of quarters

374
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:07,009
into that and then a lot of those

375
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:08,509
companies just fell off any wait another

376
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:10,129
year or two to actually see how

377
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:12,048
successful these marketing campaigns are

378
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:13,428
knowing that the cycles through

379
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:15,168
regulations that these companies have

380
00:15:13,428 --> 00:15:16,608
been failing right well I mean look like

381
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:17,418
the two strongest flower brands that

382
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:18,589
you're seeing in the market right now

383
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:20,928
are canned S&amp;M glow canna

384
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:23,179
now Flo canna they're there I mean you

385
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:24,678
know they're they are helping the small

386
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:26,208
grower and their marketing on that

387
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:27,528
platform and I think they're taking a

388
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,058
little bit more of a tongues approach

389
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:31,100
right even though they're not

390
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:35,808
necessarily taking the Tom's approach

391
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:37,249
but they definitely are I mean we're

392
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:39,469
talking my traumas the tongue right and

393
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:40,879
and and kenderson is I mean they are

394
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,609
they're taking the effect based approach

395
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:45,829
of targeting that new consumer and it's

396
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:48,470
and it's working I mean they're crushing

397
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:50,149
it and and you know I do I mean for

398
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,649
people who are entry-level flour

399
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:54,198
consumers I mean that is the way to keep

400
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:56,720
the flour alive right because going into

401
00:15:54,198 --> 00:16:00,318
the dispensary and seeing the from my

402
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,569
mom if she wants to consume flour Green

403
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:05,028
crack not only means nothing to her it

404
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:08,358
scares her right you know

405
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:11,359
gorilla glue Durbin poison I mean none

406
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:12,739
of that sounds appealing right and but

407
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:14,658
if she walks into a display bolt to her

408
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:18,288
if she walks in the dispensary and she

409
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:19,970
sees calm relaxed you know sleep she's

410
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:21,438
like that's you know also I mean she's

411
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,788
looking for she's looking to achieve in

412
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,108
effect the reason she's coming into the

413
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:25,729
dispensary is because someone told her

414
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:27,509
this will help you with your sleep this

415
00:16:25,729 --> 00:16:29,639
will help you with your menopause but

416
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:31,439
but you know she's going in and she's

417
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,720
like well gorilla glue help my menopause

418
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,840
anyone anyone and are the bartenders

419
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,180
qualified to ask answer that question I

420
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,790
think that's one thing like again I go

421
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:44,189
back to trends I've seen in other states

422
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:46,230
and how they may apply to Colorado when

423
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,700
you look at the consolidation effect

424
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,259
that happened in Colorado about two

425
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,030
years ago where native roots goes out

426
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,580
buys those mom-and-pop shops now there

427
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:55,709
are 23 different locations I think a big

428
00:16:53,580 --> 00:17:01,620
key to native roots success is also

429
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:04,650
making very open and available shop to

430
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:07,980
their consumers and having educated bud

431
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:10,350
tenders that can help the mom that is

432
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,209
looking for help with her menopause then

433
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:15,750
come in and ask that bud tender yeah

434
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,779
exactly the economics right there right

435
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:21,119
so what do we do to bridge the

436
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:23,279
educational gap that we face right now

437
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,409
when the plan is still federally illegal

438
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,529
and you have the government directly

439
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,840
telling its people lies on everything

440
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:32,819
including cannabis well and and when you

441
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,470
don't have when a lot of the brands and

442
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:37,829
the many a lot of the operators don't

443
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:40,380
have access to traditional media and

444
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:43,289
advertising and and communicating to

445
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:46,140
their and consumer to my mom how do they

446
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:48,659
reach her capital I'm not just talking

447
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,780
about money you don't have access to any

448
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,940
of the other modes of communication that

449
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,710
every other industry has right you know

450
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,809
you suppresses link some of the states

451
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,630
that we operate in you can't you can do

452
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:03,089
online ordering but you can't put prices

453
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:06,510
online we do online ordering but you

454
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:08,759
can't have pictures or you can't put

455
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:13,500
snoops name on it or whatever you want

456
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:15,480
to do yeah going back to the point you

457
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,059
made earlier to with the trends of

458
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,829
people moving towards those other craft

459
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:22,200
products compared to just smoking flour

460
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:24,000
these days you know I think well it has

461
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,670
a lot to do with the science behind this

462
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,559
where we're still very immature when it

463
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:31,050
comes to what we know about this plant

464
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,089
and the more we learn the products get

465
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:35,899
better the quality gets better

466
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:39,659
and the the medicinal effects and

467
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:42,420
identifying those it's huge I also think

468
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,590
and this goes back to this to the South

469
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,779
Park episode a little bit but I actually

470
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,069
predict we might have a little bit of a

471
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:48,389
right now VAP is still one of the

472
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:49,919
fastest growing categories and I

473
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,720
actually predict that we might see a

474
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,930
little bit of a this is a personal

475
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,009
prediction a demise of the VAP no I want

476
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,690
to say demise it's not gonna go away

477
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:59,759
entirely but I think that some more

478
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,170
research at a research is gonna come out

479
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:06,390
around how most of the baits are

480
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:07,650
currently manufactured and also I think

481
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,100
the more research will come out about

482
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:13,470
the process of vaping I also think yep

483
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:15,389
and I also think that I mean for an

484
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:19,110
industry that's very socially conscious

485
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:21,480
and environmentally conscious we've been

486
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:23,609
giving the vape and it's sort of a pass

487
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,470
and I don't know how long that's gonna

488
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:28,229
last because the amount of waste that's

489
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,640
being collected right now and the fact

490
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,079
that we can't recycle those vapes

491
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,060
because they have contaminant product

492
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:34,859
and you know unless we get this we

493
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,960
encourage the state to take action on

494
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:37,679
this somehow I think that the people

495
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,259
will revolt

496
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,769
I see the trends on the licensing side

497
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:47,519
and you know overall I think yeah high

498
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:50,069
quality outdoor grown cannabis is going

499
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,129
to be a big in in California and

500
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:55,859
depending on where the federal

501
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:58,380
regulations go I mean it could be that

502
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:59,699
everything's grown outdoor in California

503
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:06,570
and trucked across the country by

504
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:09,710
coca-cola or whatever else in terms of

505
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:13,950
trends outside of the flower category so

506
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:20,759
with edibles category

507
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:22,980
I believe gummies make up let's see but

508
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:26,039
gummies yeah let's say I'll say yeah the

509
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,180
gummies make up the majority of edible

510
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,579
sales I mean they're definitely the

511
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,680
dominant category so gummies as well as

512
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:34,169
vapes within the concept of category as

513
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,759
well as mints with an edibles category

514
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,960
right so if you think about like these

515
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,559
three products right what do they all

516
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,259
have in common

517
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,329
they

518
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:42,410
user friendliness familiarity

519
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:45,199
ease-of-use

520
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,450
right um you know these are all things

521
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,910
that for an entry-level consumer right

522
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,350
someone who is like I I want to try this

523
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:54,200
cannibal cannabis thing but I don't

524
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:56,659
really know how to do it a vape if they

525
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,430
babe cigarettes very familiar to them

526
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:03,529
gummies we've all eaten a gummy before

527
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:06,620
mints who doesn't take a mint I mean

528
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:10,609
it's one of the easier products to make

529
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:12,709
it's very simple so I see a lot more of

530
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:13,789
it that's actually another very good

531
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,049
point that you bring up right because a

532
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:16,970
lot of what we're actually seeing in the

533
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:19,269
sales right in sales is you know a lot

534
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:22,069
of people ask me like should I make a

535
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:23,809
product you know 10 units 10 milligrams

536
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:26,990
Hunter milligram total or should I do

537
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:31,419
5 milligrams 20 units hundred or five

538
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:35,390
and five and five and ten and keep it a

539
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,500
50 right and I get right now you look at

540
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,680
the data and most of the products that

541
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:42,259
are selling are 10 packs with 10

542
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,640
milligram doses that's most of the top

543
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,569
selling products right and everyone's

544
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,390
like well that's what the consumer wants

545
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:51,889
and my question is is it yeah because

546
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:54,920
maybe no one's making you know a 10

547
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:56,030
milligram or 5 milligram 10 doses for 50

548
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,880
mil you know if someone's only visiting

549
00:21:56,029 --> 00:22:01,309
for a week and doesn't want to buy 20

550
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,600
doses and they just you know I mean and

551
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:04,220
so I think that it is a function of both

552
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05,959
supply and demand and work they are Co

553
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,059
evolving together so as the new adult

554
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,670
use user right I keep coming back to my

555
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:14,149
mom and my chardonnay mom cousin because

556
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:17,720
they are very very they smoke so much

557
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:19,040
weed and now it's a joke but uh I will

558
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,620
let them comment on how much they

559
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,049
consume but but no because I mean they

560
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:26,089
are they are those are two very

561
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:28,039
representative demographics that are

562
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:30,829
starting to come into the market and and

563
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:32,869
it's a it's sort of a catch-22 almost of

564
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:34,099
like well there aren't really products

565
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:34,789
available for us and people are like

566
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:36,109
yeah but we're not gonna make the

567
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:38,569
products if the consumer is not coming

568
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:40,069
in right so you have to and that's not

569
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:41,029
what is currently happening what is

570
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:43,279
happening is that people are actually

571
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:44,379
it's like the reverse of a catch-22 if

572
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,399
you build it they will come

573
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,290
you know they are buying what's

574
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,470
available it doesn't mean that it's the

575
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:52,230
best product out there

576
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:54,149
and and I think it's also what consumer

577
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,829
are you targeting are you targeting a

578
00:22:54,148 --> 00:22:58,619
guy like me that's been smoking weed for

579
00:22:55,829 --> 00:23:00,898
more than half his life and I want to

580
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:03,388
burn really good flour and hang out and

581
00:23:00,898 --> 00:23:05,428
do my thing or are you going after that

582
00:23:03,388 --> 00:23:07,469
tourists that is coming to California

583
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:09,240
for the first time and hasn't tried

584
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:12,329
anything they're from Wisconsin

585
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,759
well edibles are very you know it's an

586
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:16,859
easy gap to fill and there's definitely

587
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:18,509
a niche for that there's knit for going

588
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:22,769
after consumers like me there's niche

589
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:25,769
for going after female market it really

590
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:27,750
depends on what product or what

591
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:30,210
demographic you're going after and then

592
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,069
you know just because that's the product

593
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,629
that's selling in that that the top

594
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:36,928
market doesn't mean it's the best it

595
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:38,428
it's what's available now and that is

596
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:40,230
and actually this court this kind of

597
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:43,320
takes it all back to something we were

598
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,519
discussing earlier is there's a lot of

599
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:46,048
folks coming into the industry with a

600
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:48,960
lot of capital and a lot of experience

601
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:50,369
and they know they know how to make a

602
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,259
lot of product they know at a scale they

603
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:54,739
know how to distribute but do they know

604
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:58,589
the industry do they actually understand

605
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:01,859
how to make a decent cannabis based

606
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:03,209
product and the answer isn't is not

607
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,278
necessarily yes and the folks that I see

608
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,169
succeeding the most and I believe will

609
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,690
continue to succeed the most are those

610
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:13,340
that take that external experience that

611
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:17,820
external capital and bring in the

612
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:20,369
indigenous endemic legacy cannabis

613
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:22,079
operator experience I mean I think that

614
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:23,339
we can all have a seat at the table it

615
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,548
doesn't need to be black and white it

616
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:28,528
doesn't need to be us versus them right

617
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:31,288
and and and in fact that way they better

618
00:24:28,528 --> 00:24:32,940
each other and and so that that is what

619
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:34,648
I say to a lot of the cannabis operators

620
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,028
right now that are struggling and they

621
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:37,079
don't know what their next step is you

622
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:40,019
know should we sell should we scale

623
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,369
should we raise you know and a lot of

624
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:42,929
them think that they can do it on their

625
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:45,479
own and continue brute-forcing it on

626
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:48,570
their own as they have for the last you

627
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,220
know X many years and the I don't want

628
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:51,839
to be pessimistic I don't I don't I

629
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,480
don't discount their experience or their

630
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,308
knowledge I respect the hell out of them

631
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,720
but the fact is that these people that

632
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:58,829
are coming in now are going to be able

633
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,269
to they're going to be coming in with a

634
00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:01,349
lot of experience and a lot of money and

635
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:03,538
they're going to be able to out

636
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:05,668
manufacture an out price and

637
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:07,378
everything the legacy operators who

638
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:11,519
don't have that experience and so with

639
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:13,769
that I beg you get some help there's

640
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,108
technology out there there's I mean

641
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:19,888
there's everything these businesses need

642
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:21,210
to operate at full capability it's just

643
00:25:19,888 --> 00:25:23,069
a matter of going out there and getting

644
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:26,369
it you know don't be afraid to spend

645
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:28,648
money on your LED lights too because

646
00:25:26,368 --> 00:25:30,238
they're in it's an expensive initial

647
00:25:28,648 --> 00:25:31,528
purchase but at the end of the day

648
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:34,139
you're gonna save money over the course

649
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:35,509
of the life of that light or or saying

650
00:25:34,138 --> 00:25:38,758
this technology build your IT

651
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:40,889
infrastructures build your structures so

652
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:43,108
it's scalable so you can continue to

653
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:45,719
grow your business and operate at the

654
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:47,189
highest level so that's a big thing the

655
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,079
other thing that I would say that I

656
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:52,889
think is going to be the next trend in

657
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:54,178
this industry is edibles without sugar

658
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:56,668
in it there's a lot of people out there

659
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:59,669
that do not want sugar I do not want to

660
00:25:56,669 --> 00:26:01,619
eat gummies that's why I smoke weed so I

661
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:03,450
see a lot of those products coming out

662
00:26:01,618 --> 00:26:06,348
in Colorado I expect to see the same

663
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,348
thing in California

664
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:17,418
