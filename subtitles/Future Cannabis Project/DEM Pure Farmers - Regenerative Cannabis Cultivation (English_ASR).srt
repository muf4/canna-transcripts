asked to put this panel together and

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,039

know some of them very well and I know

18

54
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,150
Award at the Emerald cup

55
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,830
and you know that they've been

56
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:08,569
constantly inspiring us as a community

57
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,550
with their posts and their methods and

58
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:12,949
and finally this year they put out a

59
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:16,610
book and I want to hand you the mic and

60
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:18,679
you guys each talk about the inputs of

61
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,600
your book and why you came up with it

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,400
and where maybe the next one to come

63
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:27,919
from or would there be more and so forth

64
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,510
well the book came to be because the

65
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,729
goal on our farm was really to answer

66
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:37,189
the question of what is a sustainable

67
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:40,519
farm and can a farm be a closed loop you

68
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:44,539
know sustainable organism and setting

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:47,330
out to answer that question we we did

70
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:51,650
answer that question and the answer is

71
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:55,340
yes and so we compiled all of the

72
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,620
recipes from our home made or home

73
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,020
homegrown on the farm

74
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,509
ingredients how we generate our

75
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,659
fertility to grow cannabis specific

76
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:07,639
specifically and so we wanted to share

77
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:09,229
that with everybody because we've had a

78
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:13,250
lot of success with the quality that

79
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:19,480
we've been producing and and we're

80
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:23,870
producing extremely clean you know

81
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:25,759
effective medicine so it's it's great to

82
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,410
see so much interest in regenerative

83
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,050
agriculture and I think there's a lot of

84
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,960
interest in like how how do I do this

85
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,730
on the farm and so we decided to put put

86
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,439
this recipe book together and share with

87
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:42,890
you all

88
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:45,269
[Applause]

89
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:49,050
thanks part of how this book came about

90
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:50,669
was actually because of the movement of

91
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,100
what is happening that is so much bigger

92
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:56,310
than any of us but that's really

93
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,830
something special and I think the time

94
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,449
we're living in and being involved in

95
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:03,810
what we do in the time we're living in

96
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:06,300
is just you know we're constantly facing

97
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,129
challenges every day but it's it's

98
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,400
brought us together in so many ways as a

99
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:13,980
community from local all the way to

100
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:17,549
global and it's really amazing to see

101
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:21,050
what a grassroots movement based on

102
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:24,240
people building resilience towards

103
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,889
basically every everything that's it's

104
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,750
like this David and Goliath battle right

105
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:30,029
and all of our natural resources are at

106
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,459
stake there are so many things reversing

107
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:35,009
global warming climate change putting a

108
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,930
stop to it putting a future back in our

109
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:39,389
children's hands I mean there's so much

110
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,340
more to it than than just cannabis and

111
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,399
we all know what this this plant teaches

112
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:46,919
us some really powerful lessons and but

113
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,469
one of the biggest ones is just how we

114
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,140
are about really one with nature we are

115
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:54,270
part of it and how to actually live as a

116
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,839
part of that system that was the

117
00:05:54,269 --> 00:06:01,409
question we sought out to answer and and

118
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,959
we're still asking it daily but we've

119
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,610
come to this point where here we were

120
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,049
all having this amazing discussion

121
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,900
together and we live in the middle of

122
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:13,139
nowhere in Trinity County and we feel

123
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:15,359
like a really part of a really amazing

124
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,060
community and we're not alone out there

125
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,090
and it was really nice to reach out to

126
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,769
each other and to all thank you Craig

127
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,459
you're one of the people that really has

128
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:27,359
helped make the mycelium network

129
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:29,750
connections happen and that's what's

130
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,750
happening

131
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,319
[Music]

132
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,879
but really it's about you know just all

133
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,539
of us not being afraid to just take that

134
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:45,150
first step to start wherever that is and

135
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:47,788
with every step everything exponentially

136
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:49,468
evolves from there and so it just keeps

137
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:53,418
getting better and you just keep seeing

138
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:55,560
more and more rewards of why it is

139
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:56,579
proven in time and time and time and

140
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,680
time and time and time and time again

141
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:00,538
that this really works so I'm excited to

142
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,639
hear everyone share a little bit about

143
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:03,959
that and we're just grateful that we

144
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,769

Dampier and some of the criteria needed

165

to become Dampier there's you know six

166
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:36,818
closed loops you need to identify in

167
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:40,028
your farm oh you have to identify six

168
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:43,778
closed loops on your farm you need to

169
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:47,588
identify rain catchment or your source

170
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:50,639
of water you need to have a pollinator

171
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:53,949
garden education back to the community

172
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:58,659

209
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:05,528
for this that I want to show you guys is

210
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,389
because you guys it's probably seen I've

211
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:08,889
been here since 9:00 a.m. yesterday and

212
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:11,289
like if anyone feels the same way I do

213
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:13,870
my brain is just like over loaded with

214
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:15,969
so much information but what you guys

215
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:20,230
have been seeing a lot of is photos of

216
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:22,329
these indoor grows and I want to just I

217
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,659
want there to be an example of what

218
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:29,259
regenerative arms are for us and I also

219
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:31,899
first want to call out Kelly and Josh

220
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:33,669
and Willow and Skye who are the DEM

221
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:38,950
prayer founders a dragonfly earth

222
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:40,769
medicine they are amazing because I'm

223
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:47,440
sure you've all heard of them

224
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:51,009
this is our farm in the background this

225
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:58,029
is me talking about pulling up water for

226
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:59,559
me too so I hope so oh that's what I'm

227
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:03,250
telling forest we're talking about

228
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,809
tilling and that back right right when I

229
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,589
moved down to the farmers about five

230
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:11,019
years ago forest had been chilling and

231
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:13,600
but this guy I mean I I literally saw

232
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:16,360
this guy's cannabis for the first time

233
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,430
and I was like this guy knows what he's

234
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,528
doing because I've been smoking for a

235
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:22,359
long time and I mean his his ganja was

236
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:27,039
really beautiful and it's always been

237
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:29,829
growing in this method of really huge

238
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:32,349
plants because of the genetics

239
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:34,708
we've been breed you guys have been

240
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,389
breeding for a long time his family has

241
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:39,609
strains that date back to the 70s in the

242
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:42,309
same terroir same appellation so of

243
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,379
course you know getting into that little

244
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:50,649
part regenerative agriculture really is

245
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:53,828
about using what's local and working

246
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:56,860
with what you have and I guess what I

247
00:12:53,828 --> 00:13:01,239
really wanted to talk about today was

248
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,970
integrity in in cannabis and in farming

249
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,079
these days

250
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:08,389
because we're a point in our lives where

251
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,008
where there's corporate cannabis here

252
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:11,778
right it's right around the corner it's

253
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:14,028
already come it's moving into our own

254
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:19,249
backyards and it's so scary

255
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:21,649
because to grow on a smaller scale we do

256
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:24,288
10,000 square feet for us that's huge

257
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:27,948
and it's all outdoor everything's in the

258
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:30,139
ground and it's all from seed if we make

259
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:32,899
clones it's from our own genetics and we

260
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:34,759
make the clones right and soil we've

261
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:36,708
been trying to educate a little bit more

262
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:40,808
about that since people are going a lot

263
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:44,149
towards that row but the integrity of

264
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:46,278
when you're working on this farm and

265
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:47,828
things come up such as you have a new

266
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:50,538
pest that you've never seen before

267
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:53,478
instead of making the decision to go and

268
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:55,548
buy some chemical or buy something from

269
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:58,339
the store that is going to be a quick

270
00:13:55,548 --> 00:14:00,858
and easy fix the integral part of that

271
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:04,609
which is what your commitment is as a

272
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:08,509
dragonfly earth earth medicine certified

273
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:11,179
farm is to to check everything that

274
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:13,428
you're doing because every single

275
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:15,318
decision that we make from seed to soil

276
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:18,019
and everything that I'm doing right now

277
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:21,918
everything that we do every single day

278
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:25,399
is a decision and we have to commit

279
00:14:21,918 --> 00:14:28,578
ourselves to really knowing what are the

280
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:32,298
impacts of that decision everything that

281
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:35,028
we do this is like our daily lives can

282
00:14:32,298 --> 00:14:38,269
be walked in a sacred way and we can

283
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:42,308
continue on the path of this

284
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:45,109
regenerative beautiful uplifting place I

285
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:49,368
mean look at all happy it's like my

286
00:14:45,109 --> 00:14:52,158
parents is like my guys are so big it's

287
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:54,769
just when you create Beauty around you

288
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:56,599
and when you walk that way when every

289
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:58,220
single decision in your life and we're

290
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:59,749
not all perfect I mean my god we're

291
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,168
human like we're all gonna do things

292
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:05,149
that maybe we shouldn't do but just

293
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:07,639
integrity of every single day and I'm

294
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:09,708
making an effort to do my best and to

295
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,139
actually give back to the earth because

296
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:14,478
we're all taking from it so it's time

297
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:15,080
that we start giving back a lot of our

298
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:18,950
methods

299
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:22,430
are basically building compost all the

300
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:25,640
time we're just constantly adding and

301
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:27,889
it's adding from our own local resources

302
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:31,399
so we're not going out and trying to

303
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:33,679
seek too much outside of ourselves and

304
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,750
outside of our own farms we know that

305
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,509
the knowledge is there to deal with

306
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:41,000
obstacles that come up we understand

307
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:43,250
that everything that we need is on the

308
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,620
farm ready all the local medicinal

309
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,289
plants everything that's growing in

310
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,870
abundance can help to be a part of your

311
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:53,000
farm you can make beautiful compost teas

312
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,909
with the things that are growing right

313
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,600
right by your feet nothing's ever a weed

314
00:15:55,909 --> 00:16:00,829
it's all medicinal it's all beautiful if

315
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
there's a lot of weeds growing in your

316
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,009
garden you're concerned about it those

317
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,540
weeds are there for a reason they're

318
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:08,120
growing because they want to protect the

319
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:10,009
soil underneath from eroding or whatever

320
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,710
purpose they serve everything has its

321
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:14,929
purpose and when we are working with

322
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,600
cannabis this amazing medicine that we

323
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:19,849
all love I'm just here to as a little

324
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,129
reminder at that's saying integrity

325
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:26,570
matters and our decisions ripple out so

326
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:29,360
be what you want to see in the world we

327
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,970
have the potential to really change the

328
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,039
wave of agriculture that is set in

329
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,649
standard today especially in California

330
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:38,000
and our Pacific coast in the United

331
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:41,659
States we have an a we have the

332
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
opportunity to really create a higher

333
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:46,219
bar higher standard and doing

334
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,350
regenerative agriculture is a way to set

335
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,540
that bar for a new wave of agriculture

336
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,180
that's actually not depleting our soils

337
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:55,639
and that's actually giving back so that

338
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,799
we can work with the conditions that we

339
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:00,769
have like wildfires and droughts things

340
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:03,289
up that are real for us right now if we

341
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,150
don't play a part in that in our daily

342
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:08,949
decisions and everything that we do from

343
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,949
seed to what you buy

344
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:23,269
thank you I want to add to two comments

345
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:25,279
to what you were talking about one was

346
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:29,500
you're saying you make clones or

347
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:37,869
cuttings what do you use to root those

348
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:40,910
so we make cuttings we have we just use

349
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:44,779
put put soil in there and block it up

350
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:49,400
and we make our own rooting hormone at a

351
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:53,509
willow tea and then aloe so we make the

352
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:57,320
tea once we put the we dip our starts or

353
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:59,980
cuttings in the aloe first and then we

354
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:03,619
pour the willow tea over and as they're

355
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,480
rooting we can add more willow tea just

356
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:13,099
as like when we're watering our plants

357
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:16,069
so you can just just like making regular

358
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:19,159
tea so just cut it up in little pieces

359
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:21,559
and put it in a pot and bring it to a

360
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,600
boil don't let it boil too much or you

361
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:28,220
could just do it without oiling and

362
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:31,549
it'll take a lot longer but simmer it

363
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:34,519
don't don't overcook it and I think I've

364
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:37,279
seen you guys having some setup in jars

365
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:39,589
so yeah are you making it making maybe

366
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,480
like a gallon or two of it and then

367
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:42,559
putting in a pint jars or something so

368
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,299
when you're ready to work you don't have

369
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,490
to do all this prep you can prep on

370
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:48,259
rainy days and then use it a week or two

371
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:51,259
yeah you can use it whenever you want

372
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:52,910
but it's really easy to work week to use

373
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:55,220
we have a big willow tree right outside

374
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:59,960
our house so we have it readily

375
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:03,559
available all the time so we can by the

376
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,509
time the the clones are ready to go out

377
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:08,049
and be transplanted they're actually

378
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:10,819
like bigger than when you cut them and

379
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:12,859
they're healthier and more vibrant and

380
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:15,980
they're already in their native soil

381
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:19,669
that you're gonna be using anyways so

382
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:23,120
which is awesome fantastic thank you

383
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:25,940
guys just give you a quick description

384
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:28,159
of our farm kind of what we do what what

385
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,690
makes us special in this

386
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:35,269
we're also recipients to the

387
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:39,980
regenerative farm award from 2017 couple

388
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:41,930
years ago but I think what I can add to

389
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,339
this discussion cuz because there's a

390
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,320
lot of US farmers up here and we all

391
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:48,740
have great practices is is kind of my

392
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:52,159
passion for for growing food for people

393
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:56,240
alongside medicine alongside our herb

394
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,040
and and so we're a production vegetable

395
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,019
farm we grow food not only for ourselves

396
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:04,399
and for our kitchen but we grow food for

397
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:07,039
market and for our community and and the

398
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,700
importance of that has has become a big

399
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,950
part of kind of I feel like my role in

400
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,819
the world what what makes me feel

401
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:18,350
complete as a person and what makes me

402
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:21,200
the only thing that that that's made

403
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:24,799
sense in the world to sort of say so I

404
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,870
kind of started down this path as a

405
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,000
homesteader getting back to the land

406
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:31,939
getting away from the dysfunction of

407
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,309
society and seeing if I could close all

408
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,470
these loops seeing if I could have a

409
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:38,659
sustainable farm and grow what I needed

410
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:42,620
there and create my own power and be

411
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:44,269
responsible for the things for my own

412
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:45,979
life they'll build my own house those

413
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:48,529
kinds of things and and it's a really

414
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:51,140
satisfying path and I loved it and I

415
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:52,849
loved growing cannabis to support that

416
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,300
path in creating this great product for

417
00:20:52,849 --> 00:21:00,379
people but I also started feeling the

418
00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:02,029
this responsibility to my can create

419
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,830
this bubble I can create this bubble of

420
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:06,980
sustainability in the eddy of this river

421
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,669
of culture and but but this river is

422
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,870
still here

423
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,390
there's still everybody there's still

424
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:13,609
everybody in town there's still all all

425
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,190
the elders who aren't gonna get out in

426
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:17,959
the garden there's still the people with

427
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,420
with a little postage stamp of a yard

428
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,120
and and the people without without the

429
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,860
desire to do the manual labor to grow

430
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,148
food and those people need to be in that

431
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,788
Lou

432
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:30,069
of sustainability and and if those

433
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:33,249
people don't have the option for good

434
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:35,950
food grown in a good way they're gonna

435
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:38,409
get the next best option and that's not

436
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,048
going to be as good for the planet as as

437
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:43,019
what I feel like I was learning to do

438
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:45,548
the skills I was learning for myself

439
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:47,499
being able to bring those out and share

440
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:49,538
those and create an option for our

441
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:51,729
community where they can buy food that's

442
00:21:49,538 --> 00:21:55,950
grown with no-till that's grown with a

443
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:58,598
lot of closed-loop techniques and

444
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:02,739
therefore is also incredibly nutritious

445
00:21:58,598 --> 00:22:06,249
and delicious and all of that so so for

446
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:08,409
me that was like the next step for me in

447
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:12,759
this whole process is kind of the Dharma

448
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:16,149
but my responsibility not only to my my

449
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:19,179
own geeking out on all this stuff but my

450
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:21,998
responsibility to my world to my to my

451
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:25,690
legacy in the future and in the past in

452
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:27,729
in this pieces like if we're gaining

453
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:30,009
skills as farmers I think it is an

454
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:31,239
amazing gift to give cannabis to the

455
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:35,079
world I think it's an amazing gift to

456
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:36,729
grow this great medicine and but I've

457
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:38,319
never been a big fan of monocropping

458
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:40,359
I've been never been a big fan of life

459
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,128
you know you can have a diverse cannabis

460
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:44,079
farm and you look at above and if it's

461
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:49,778
still 90% of your canopy is cannabis

462
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:51,548
it's a monocrop farm and and I just want

463
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:53,440
all of this skill and all of this

464
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:55,898
thought that we're all putting into this

465
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,919
to share on this broader scale because

466
00:22:55,898 --> 00:22:59,588
there's lots of people that don't even

467
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:03,450
smoke cannabis but man they they eat

468
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:03,450
food and that's medicine in the same way

469
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:14,039
and so what we've been working on a lot

470
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,490
on our farm is is how these things

471
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:20,759
integrate how production food farming

472
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,230
systems which is you know with

473
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,960
production food farming if you're gonna

474
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:27,750
make it work and not lose money but

475
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,910
actually say break even or maybe even

476
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,250
make a little bit of money for your time

477
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:34,620
doing it it's it's a different kind of

478
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,660
model than doing a garden and it's it's

479
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:39,869
about efficiency and planning and and

480
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,519
kind of the combination of efficiency

481
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:44,879
and planning and and doing things

482
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:47,339
according to your morals and worldview

483
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,140
as well but what we've been really

484
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:51,269
looking into is is how the cannabis

485
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,000
works with those kinds of systems how to

486
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:56,160
integrate it so you can give cannabis

487
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,470
and food crops out of the same area so

488
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,120
the the food crops and the systems you

489
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:04,289
use for the food crops can support the

490
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:07,379
cannabis and how the lessons that that

491
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:08,700
market gardeners and and food farmers

492
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,980
have been learning for years which is

493
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,860
you don't make much money off of a head

494
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,630
of lettuce so if you want to do it right

495
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:17,339
you have to be efficient you have to be

496
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,900
thoughtful and you have to do these

497
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:22,829
closed-loop things because you're not

498
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:26,610
going to the store to buy a $50 a gallon

499
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:28,579
jug of nutrients to grow arugula it's

500
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:33,449
just not it's not something what you do

501
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:34,889
so these lessons that the small-scale

502
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,720
market gardeners have been working on

503
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,640
for for some decades now since the

504
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,210
organic movement are really applicable

505
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,330
to us and the in the cannabis community

506
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:47,250
and vice versa so that that's been the

507
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:50,460
focus of our farm is working with that

508
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:54,019
and I invite you to check us out on

509
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,019
Instagram see what we do and

510
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:15,069
let's let's go over to Kelly now and

511
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:17,500
Kelly let's uh let's have you let's have

512
00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:20,950
you talk about how last year's

513
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:23,919
regenitive conference and read way

514
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:26,379
affected you guys in and what you did

515
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,679
with some knowledge you gain and some of

516
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:32,939
the inspiration okay my name is Kelly

517
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:39,309
I'm with Hard Rock Mountain Farm

518
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:42,009
groundwater value last year we came here

519
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:43,869
and we were general kind of cannabis is

520
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:45,909
kind of like a rabbit hole and we were

521
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:51,369
like looking down it for a long time

522
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:52,720
really and then after we came and we

523
00:25:51,369 --> 00:25:55,000
were exposed to all these wonderful

524
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,909
ideas and seeing all these wonderful

525
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,349
people um I'm gonna get to sit next to

526
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:06,129
now which is like really inspiring we

527
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:07,449
took a lot of initiative after and the

528
00:26:06,128 --> 00:26:10,269
things that we learned like we went and

529
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,289
put in 220 feet of Google culture we got

530
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:14,038
all of our water on solar

531
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:18,278
[Applause]

532
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:20,470
we started making teas we did we're

533
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:21,638
moving towards no-till still and that's

534
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,548
another thing it's like we learned

535
00:26:21,638 --> 00:26:26,079
that's okay that's a process and that we

536
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:28,538
get to all move towards that and work

537
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,099
towards that like together and just

538
00:26:28,538 --> 00:26:31,898
coming to all these things and learning

539
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:36,369
about everything and connecting with

540
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:39,158
people has been really helpful to us we

541
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:42,158
also learned that regenerative like is

542
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,600
like a lifestyle and it can be like the

543
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,590
things that you eat and put into your

544
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:49,298
body or even like we were we made it out

545
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:51,548
of the fires this year by the skin of

546
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:53,230
our teeth and so now we're gonna work on

547
00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:56,940
improving the health of the forest

548
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,940
around us so it's not a tinderbox

549
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:05,509
we're still dialing everything in and

550
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:07,369
we're diving and it's like we're still

551
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:09,140
falling down that rabbit hole and still

552
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:11,539
seeing so much more that we can improve

553
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:19,820
on and it's a never ending journey that

554
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:21,619
we're really happy to be on so what

555
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:24,289
you're in Potter Valley is that right

556
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:26,239
what uh you have an influence on your

557
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:28,039
neighbors or other folks on your road or

558
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,960
community members yeah absolutely so

559
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:32,480
we're going through and we're talking to

560
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,720
all the other growers we know whether or

561
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,250
not they're legal or not and we're

562
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,130
getting them to dump their smart pots

563
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,740
we're introducing companion planting to

564
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:46,460
them we're convincing them to grow more

565
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:49,190
food for themselves just like all the

566
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,500
small things to improve yeah just like

567
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:58,940
our world around us because it's a

568
00:27:51,500 --> 00:28:01,220
reflection of ourselves yeah one thing

569
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:05,660
he's right there really resonated with

570
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:09,829
me and that was whether they were in the

571
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:11,480
regulated market or not and and that's a

572
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:16,399
choice that your neighbors are making or

573
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:18,200
not making and that's one you know that

574
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,690
choice doesn't bother me either way but

575
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,150
can we still help them even if they're

576
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:25,309
in the unregulated market to still

577
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:28,580
become regenerative well that helps the

578
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:30,259
overall plan that we have and to better

579
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:33,529
the earth and to help our environment

580
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:35,509
heal so we don't you don't want to be

581
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:37,099
judgmental on a neighbor if they're

582
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:39,079
choosing to go a different route but

583
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:40,369
let's just help them and show them that

584
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,990
there's a better way that they can

585
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:44,569
actually run their farm whether it's

586
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:47,079
whatever market they choose to be in um

587
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:53,339
so thank you Kelly yeah

588
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:56,679
[Applause]

589
00:28:53,339 --> 00:29:02,379
next we'll run with Cyril from water dog

590
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:03,519
hey guys farm so Karl I mentioned

591
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:06,190
something earlier and I just don't want

592
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,960
to piggyback it and and it's like to me

593
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,940
permaculture is kind of like really

594
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,670
brought this for me and and I saw a

595
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,860
quote today a friend posted it was

596
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:17,050
permaculture is a revolution disguised

597
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:18,789
as a garden party so if you can look at

598
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:21,579
everything we're doing as a revolution

599
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:23,710
against the standard model and the way

600
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:26,559
big AG is and like the influence

601
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:28,990
regenerative is having on AG is pretty

602
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,700
incredible so one of the things I think

603
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,559
would be cool for you guys to walk away

604
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,539
with is like some things to go home with

605
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,609
and one of the things that we've

606
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:39,509
realized on our farm is like diversity

607
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:42,129
is really the key and so I would suggest

608
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:44,559
seeking out all the plants you can find

609
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,900
that have pink flowers yellow flowers

610
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,990
white flowers red flowers purple flowers

611
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:52,840
blue flowers small flowers big flowers

612
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:55,180
and plant them in your ecosystem and and

613
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:56,949
to me like the that's gonna bring in

614
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,990
like after here in the bug lady talking

615
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:02,140
that's gonna bring in that ecosystem to

616
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,009
keep all those bugs happy and you know

617
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,290
one of the things I like to talk about

618
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:06,879
is just context and like all of us have

619
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:08,920
a slightly different context that we're

620
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,870
gonna come to this table with and so if

621
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,720
you can find what your context is and

622
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:15,909
see how these tools in the tool belt can

623
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,350
work for you on your farm because for

624
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:19,810
some people who the culture just isn't

625
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:21,129
gonna work so don't even think about it

626
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:23,169
or maybe that's all you should think

627
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,420
about and so really finding what's the

628
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,340
tools that you're going to use and take

629
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:30,009
advantage of so you know on our farm we

630
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:34,599
have animals we have horses sheeps

631
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:38,079
chickens not really like composting my

632
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:40,869
dog crap but I had a pile of it that

633
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:43,329
okay Akashi its poo Kosh who taught you

634
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:45,009
okay cool and that's the other thing is

635
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:46,389
like I'm constantly learning I came here

636
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:49,000
and I learned a little bit about the

637
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:51,759
Korean natural farming today and just

638
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,099
constantly trying to learn more but so

639
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,450
we incorporate a lot of compost and you

640
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:57,369
know the horse manure gets fed to the

641
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,769
chickens and the chickens then it goes

642
00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:00,619
to the worms and this is like part of

643
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:03,549
the closing loop

644
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:06,229
systems that that we're talking about

645
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:08,329
and you know one of the things that

646
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:11,480
we've realized is with companion

647
00:31:08,329 --> 00:31:15,019
planting I do a lot of experimenting for

648
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,240
fun and I'm obsessed with it and so

649
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:18,950
we've gotten the there's a difference

650
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,170
between companion planting in

651
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,730
competition planting and so it's really

652
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,890
important to if you are going to start

653
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:27,170
companion planting to make sure you're

654
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:29,600
not competing with your cash crop and

655
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:31,970
like for most of us the cannabis is our

656
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:34,609
cash crop so if you're experimenting on

657
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:36,740
a large scale just make sure that if it

658
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:38,990
fails you're not out of business because

659
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,039
like we need all of us to be growing the

660
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,839
cannabis it's gonna change these

661
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:44,149
people's minds so when they smoke our

662
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,459
weed they're gonna start thinking oh man

663
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:48,559
this is amazing and you know big agz

664
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,769
really looking at this and and so it's

665
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,730
it's the ripple effects are gonna be big

666
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:54,529
so one of the things that we've realized

667
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:57,519
and this is kind of a cool thing you

668
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:59,660
guys can take home and in practice is

669
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,970
companion planting with high terpene

670
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,980
plants and if you understand like almost

671
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,289
all plants have terpenes and so if

672
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,720
you're growing high tripping rich plants

673
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:11,389
your lemon bombs your lavenders your

674
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,339
Rosemary's you know yarrow is a great

675
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:15,559
companion plant to have and and in in

676
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:17,480
the the flower days book they've got a

677
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:19,099
lot of recipes that that are very easy

678
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,990
site I definitely suggest everyone to

679
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:23,480
buy that book just to have some some

680
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:26,750
things to do but we've noticed that so

681
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,940
terpenes they communicate in the air

682
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,079
whereas the roots that you know

683
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,360
everything that's happening in the roots

684
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,730
is is communicating in the soil so if

685
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:35,928
you have high terpene plants in your

686
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,460
ecosystem they're going to be

687
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:39,019
communicating with your cannabis and

688
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:43,100
you're gonna actually get higher

689
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:44,900
profiles so we we have we we do planting

690
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:46,939
with high tripping plants near our

691
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,190
cannabis and then we're also feeding

692
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:52,210
those plants to the cannabis and we're

693
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:56,240
seeing really amazing results with

694
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:59,450
fermenting specific crops you can do

695
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,819
lemon balm you know we did a side by

696
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,558
side experiment with lavender to to

697
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:06,200
clones in the lavender the plant that

698
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:07,940
got the lavender ferment had a little

699
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,460
law off the charts compared to plant

700
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:13,940
that did it so you know we did that this

701
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:15,500
year and I made a mistake and when I was

702
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,538
securing my weed because I wanted to do

703
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,919
the experiment the plants are

704
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:22,490
communicating in the soil they're

705
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:23,538
communicating through the terpenes but

706
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,730
then I also wanted to do it one step

707
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:27,980
further and cure the weed with these hi

708
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,620
tripping plants but I didn't do a side

709
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,019
to side by side so it didn't really work

710
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:33,739
because it wasn't really scientific but

711
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:35,659
so I'm just really a big fan of

712
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,538
companion planting and making sure

713
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:40,009
you're not competing and there's just

714
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:42,619
there's a lot of closed loops that we

715
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:44,329
can all do that just makes us not spend

716
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:46,250
as much money growing our weed because

717
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:49,128
the margins just aren't there and a lot

718
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:52,878
of these closed loops really help lessen

719
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:54,349
what we have to pay so if I'll be I'll

720
00:33:52,878 --> 00:33:55,579
be quick because I'm sure you guys have

721
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:56,808
a lot of questions and we can get

722
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:59,148
through the panel and start answering

723
00:33:56,808 --> 00:34:01,220
like specific things that you guys can

724
00:33:59,148 --> 00:34:03,768
all start doing and and really like it

725
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,558
don't be overwhelmed because just start

726
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:08,690
doing one thing and two things and start

727
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,159
closing as many loops as you can and you

728
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,490
probably already are without even

729
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,679
knowing it and if you live in the woods

730
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:18,309
you have an ecosystem that's right for

731
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,898
the harvesting if you do it right so

732
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:22,460
it's all about context you know don't be

733
00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:24,138
overwhelmed because what he's doing is

734
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,568
different than what I'm doing and we're

735
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:29,059
all slightly different and you know I'm

736
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:31,338
a one-man army and someone else might

737
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:33,279
have five employees so we're gonna be

738
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:36,559
attacking different things differently

739
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,179
so that's kind of all I want to say and

740
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:42,949
I'd love to answer questions when people

741
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:46,849
have them and I'm gonna go back a little

742
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:50,750
bit before the guild like imagine we all

743
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:52,879
move to a community with no money and we

744
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,760
all didn't have to work very hard we

745
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:57,980
just met at the river every day and swam

746
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:03,170
and like money was money wasn't a

747
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:05,030
problem we had we had money you could

748
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:09,019
sell at one pound for five thousand

749
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:11,420
dollars you could grow you know it was

750
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:15,318
an amazing childhood in southern

751
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:18,409
Humboldt and then it turned dark with

752
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:22,099
Reagan and all that but those those few

753
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:24,429
years kind of defined a lot of our lives

754
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:26,630
like it's hard to go back to that and

755
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:27,799
when regenerative farming and

756
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,800
permaculture

757
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,380
started really gaining knowledge and

758
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,210
becoming an Advanced Study it's I

759
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,990
latched on to that because of the

760
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:42,440
patterns were similar and like pursuing

761
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:43,909
money and economics isn't really the

762
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,820
goal because we're just trying to get

763
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:49,750
back to not worrying about money and

764
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:54,289
it's the pattern right like in

765
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:56,150
regenerative economics in regenerative

766
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:57,320
farming you're trying to build my

767
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,220
ceiling and we're trying to build

768
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,350
networks you're trying to build

769
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:06,259
connections and so only through

770
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:09,679
diversity and connections do we actually

771
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:14,600
get to quality and it's the same with

772
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:18,739
economics like if you channel all the

773
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:21,139
money into an investment page or if you

774
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:23,779
channel all your investment out of a

775
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:26,389
community then you're left with a

776
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:30,550
dwindling distri that doesn't really

777
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:33,920
have life so Carrie Reynolds and I

778
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:35,390
realize that this community like has

779
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,670
been getting you kidding the life sucked

780
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:43,150
out of a lot of the farming and it's

781
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:46,369
like innovation is born out of necessity

782
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:49,809
so the the fact that this small scale

783
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:52,279
like the county came and you know set up

784
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:55,429
10,000 square feet in Mendo and and

785
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:59,030
limited acreage is here and humbled and

786
00:36:55,429 --> 00:37:01,250
we're like really reduced out in a small

787
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:04,460
scale but at the same time now we're

788
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:09,110
learning that being small scale doesn't

789
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:12,610
limit our production or innovation like

790
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:16,430
we can John Jevons is renowned worldwide

791
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:18,680
for growing amazing amounts of food and

792
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:22,279
the small acreage and he's from here in

793
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:25,690
Willets right like the innovation that

794
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:29,090
we can create in doing this regenerative

795
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:31,429
agriculture in these confined spaces is

796
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:34,870
amazing amazing Daniel can feed 40

797
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:34,869
families from his one farm

798
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:49,799
how many people can you get stoned from

799
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:52,690
that one farm nice and when the county

800
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,310
looked at us and said no cannabis

801
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,608
shouldn't be grown in the forest or in

802
00:37:54,309 --> 00:38:00,009
the hills like we're building soil in

803
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:02,739
forest landscapes so now we're we're

804
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:08,830
becoming an agroforestry region I think

805
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:11,139
we invented a farm system like because

806
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:13,420
we had people we have people from all

807
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:17,980
over the world living on our farms where

808
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:20,559
is that possible we have we have we

809
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:25,740
donate our own money to our nonprofits

810
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:29,108
we we're the first homesteader

811
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:32,319
homesteaders were salvaging old-growth

812
00:38:29,108 --> 00:38:34,569
like deciduous mulch to grow their

813
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,309
cannabis plants born out of necessity

814
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:38,140
because they didn't have money but now

815
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:41,108
we realize that that's the same methods

816
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:43,420
that grow the best cannabis that IMO's

817
00:38:41,108 --> 00:38:47,319
of old-growth and I'm not saying go out

818
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:50,230
and scrape old-growth forests but that's

819
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:53,470
you know that's kind of what define

820
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:56,289
Humboldt County pot is that like those

821
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:57,639
that first wave of innovation and now

822
00:38:56,289 --> 00:39:02,050
we're in the same thing like we're

823
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:04,719
getting attacked by investment huge

824
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:08,019
investment banks and the legalization

825
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:10,269
process has been the nightmare it's not

826
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:13,000
it's you know some of the the rules make

827
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:14,440
sense but they also come at it in a

828
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,500
political manner so we're not really

829
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:23,440
gaining I don't know it's been difficult

830
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:25,599
but this movement is creating a rapid

831
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,369
innovation that I think has the

832
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,130
possibility to really change the world

833
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:32,890
like you're saying so we started the

834
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:35,079
guild to really bring this knowledge to

835
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:37,659
our community so if you guys want to

836
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:40,299
present to our community and be a part

837
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:42,250
of building that Network in this region

838
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,740
we're starting the soham guild and I

839
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,679
know there's other reed communities up

840
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:48,318
and down the north coast

841
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:51,259
that are like really networking and

842
00:39:48,318 --> 00:40:04,818
getting that knowledge to raise the

843
00:39:51,260 --> 00:40:05,809
small farm level up so they the one of

844
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:09,048
the thing that's missing in a lot of

845
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:11,599
businesses is that kind of equity share

846
00:40:09,048 --> 00:40:13,250
with your employees or your partner's

847
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,068
that you're working with and and there's

848
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,838
a lot of standard model CEO at the top

849
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:19,308
making all the money the guy down there

850
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,769
is making nothing and he's not really

851
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:23,269
vested in the company and so you know

852
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:26,329
this is also a good opportunity for

853
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:29,210
young farms to actually start changing

854
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:31,670
that and getting your employees at like

855
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:33,798
a different share I mean they can still

856
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:37,490
get a paycheck but then they're also an

857
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:39,108
equity owner and you know it actually

858
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:42,169
took me a really long time to kind of

859
00:40:39,108 --> 00:40:43,940
like come around to that because I was I

860
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,680
was like well if I'm they got the money

861
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,329
and I got the land and I'm doing all the

862
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:50,058
work and I have one employee why would I

863
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:52,510
give him equity and then I realized

864
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:54,650
actually that's really nice for them and

865
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,270
it literally took me years to get to

866
00:40:54,650 --> 00:41:00,289
that but I think that's one thing that

867
00:40:56,269 --> 00:41:02,119
that is missing in the this model is the

868
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:04,630
equity shares and that's something that

869
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:09,680
you know each person could kind of

870
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:12,440
accept you know yeah like there's

871
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,480
standards that were part of this black

872
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:18,740
market industry that we should carry

873
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:24,650
over that we should not lose some of the

874
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:28,028
beautiful parts of the black market free

875
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:31,039
peoples market yeah the old dirt road

876
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:33,318
you know it was people the people

877
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:36,109
networking you knew a guy that lived in

878
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:38,538
the city that could bring it to your

879
00:41:36,108 --> 00:41:40,298
friend who you know you follow the chain

880
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:43,250
and everybody made a little bit of money

881
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:45,528
like that was sweet I can still do that

882
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:48,739
it doesn't all have to go through some

883
00:41:45,528 --> 00:41:52,670
major business it could go through a

884
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:54,858
network of value-based businesses you

885
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:58,400
know what are your values do they have

886
00:41:54,858 --> 00:42:07,699
integrity with my values let's form a

887
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:10,880
helium Network Rio's mentioning

888
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:15,230
innovation and where that comes from

889
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,420
then you're saying like that necessity

890
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:20,269
is part of that and we are at a point

891
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:22,278
where it is very necessary for us to

892
00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:23,750
make this paradigm shift into

893
00:42:22,278 --> 00:42:26,778
regenerative agriculture that's what's

894
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:30,079
gonna the only thing really that can

895
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:32,809
possibly work against global warming

896
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,210
against too much co2 in the air too much

897
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:36,980
greenhouse gases it's putting it back in

898
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:38,750
the soil it's these processes of putting

899
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,429
it back in the soil so like everyone

900
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,769
they're here that's making soil like

901
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:44,899
yeah big round of applause for making

902
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:48,798
soil for putting back carbon in the

903
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:50,990
earth so we can grow food so we can grow

904
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:54,798
medicine and be a part of healing this

905
00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:56,659
planet part of innovation though is it

906
00:42:54,798 --> 00:42:58,519
comes from this these this network

907
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:01,129
that's coming together and everyone's

908
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:03,440
different viewpoints and as Cyril was

909
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:05,510
talking about Blake I mean going to your

910
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,670
farmers I learned so much and everyone's

911
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,278
farmed like Daniels was insane like just

912
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:12,680
so much because there they are paying

913
00:43:10,278 --> 00:43:15,500
attention to their land intently day

914
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:17,480
after day studying the little bugs that

915
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,119
are going around taking some amazing

916
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,969
photos to like Cyril is incredible

917
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:28,130
photographer and he's pull up one of

918
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:30,048
these that's really pretty

919
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:39,690
he knows understands light and you can

920
00:43:30,048 --> 00:43:42,009
tell that he's paying attention well

921
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:45,070
observation is a big deal that's getting

922
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:48,670
a lot done this is Daniel and Taylor

923
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:51,100
this is a Price limb forest farms and

924
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:53,409
it's just such a beautiful farm so much

925
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:55,960
food produced and just an incredibly

926
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:58,480
beautiful family making incredible food

927
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,130
and medicine and it's just been such a

928
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,829
privilege to be able to go into these

929
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:04,630
farms and learn the different techniques

930
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:05,019
that they have figured out over these

931
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:07,470
years

932
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:09,699
Daniel was very like amazing and

933
00:44:07,469 --> 00:44:12,849
thoughtful tilling processes that

934
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:15,399
actually are like Harvard like ended up

935
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:17,289
leading to really amazing microbial life

936
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,539
in fact your micro Raizel tests like

937
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:21,250
from last year was showing that it had a

938
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:23,559
higher count than the store-bought Mike

939
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,840
Grayson products and but through really

940
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:28,869
thoughtful cover crop and poly culture

941
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:31,420
and tilling and Casey as also adapt some

942
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:35,079
of these the hero right is the tiller

943
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:38,230
yeah but so just like learning new

944
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:40,480
innovations from each farm back in the I

945
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:42,849
mean the turn of the century farm

946
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,820
sharing was was normal it was it wasn't

947
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:47,980
until the world wars in the Harvard

948
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:50,050
Bosch process and and chemical

949
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,909
fertilizer being able to be made from

950
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:53,830
taking that nitrogen from the air and

951
00:44:51,909 --> 00:44:55,929
you know the only thing that can do that

952
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:58,059
normally is the bacteria in the soil the

953
00:44:55,929 --> 00:45:00,099
Rhizobium in like legumes but

954
00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:03,119
enlightening can do that as well but we

955
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:05,889
invent this process got invented that

956
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,509
basically pressurizes it so much and

957
00:45:05,889 --> 00:45:09,909
you're able to take that end to that has

958
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:12,130
a really powerful triple bond the

959
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:16,000
hardest thing to like break apart and

960
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:17,470
turn it into plant usable nitrogen when

961
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,449
that happened and all of a sudden like

962
00:45:17,469 --> 00:45:21,039
they started putting that out everywhere

963
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:22,960
now it's something that you own you own

964
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,360
fertility there was only so much

965
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,070
nitrogen so there's only so much people

966
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,920
that could be supported by that and it

967
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:33,250
was about 1 billion so when this guy

968
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:35,409
invented then we could rise to 7.5 or

969
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:37,329
whatever billion we are now which is

970
00:45:35,409 --> 00:45:40,960
really rough on the earth and it's a

971
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:44,099
total out of process nitrogen cycle it's

972
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:48,490
way too much of it and we're beyond

973
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:51,190
carrying capacity and so that idea that

974
00:45:48,489 --> 00:45:52,449
like fertility could be owned and you

975
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:55,900
could sell these process

976
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:58,269
of industrialized agriculture that you

977
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:00,369
just spray and you feed and you'd kill

978
00:45:58,269 --> 00:46:02,139
and you'd make a model crop and you just

979
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:03,880
get rid of all the diversity it was

980
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:06,848
something that could be owned and sold

981
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,309
and you know makes dollars and cents and

982
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:10,630
it's very linear and and it's straight

983
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:12,489
to waste

984
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:15,640
innovation stop then because it was

985
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:18,069
basically that was tried it wasn't good

986
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:19,509
for the companies and so this rebirth

987
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:20,950
right now where we share as much

988
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,359
information as possible is really

989
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:23,919
important the innovations that were

990
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:25,598
happening in the forties on farms were

991
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,680
amazing and then it just stopped and

992
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:32,140
then it's just the same crap but like us

993
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:34,769
cannabis growers we we are very

994
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:38,650
inventive I mean we went through

995
00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:40,210
prohibition of 80 years and like I think

996
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:42,220
we were winning I don't know if this is

997
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:44,710
great right now like we were doing

998
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:46,139
pretty good because it's a yeah okay

999
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:48,849
great

1000
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:50,710
but it's a lot of amazing eventful

1001
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:52,809
thoughtful creative people that we're

1002
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:54,420
working in this environment we we have

1003
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:57,130
this incredible potential right now

1004
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,990
taking that energy that we all have that

1005
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:00,608
love that we have with cannabis and the

1006
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:02,049
way that it connects us with nature and

1007
00:47:00,608 --> 00:47:03,818
then now the way that it connects us

1008
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:05,710
with each other like we've always I

1009
00:47:03,818 --> 00:47:07,000
think everyone here understands that

1010
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:09,760
we've been brought together by cannabis

1011
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,369
like in so many ways you know sharing

1012
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,290
the joint and I mean I love cannabis so

1013
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:16,539
much everything is fun for me and I

1014
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:18,550
would have met all these people without

1015
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:21,099
this connection that's wanting to share

1016
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:22,599
this love for the earth so I'm thankful

1017
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:25,300
for the plant I'm thankful for this

1018
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:27,760
community and I'm so pleased to be able

1019
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,230
to do this award and go to some of the

1020
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,140
best farms I've ever been to and the

1021
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:34,210
idea that cells are runner up holy shit

1022
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:38,139
okay that's amazing because your farm is

1023
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:41,500
incredible like like like in any like

1024
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:43,809
when I thought of this idea years ago

1025
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,699
the idea of even going to finding a farm

1026
00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:48,190
immediately like you're like would be

1027
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:49,509
like cool that's it like and and now to

1028
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:51,849
see all of these farms and all these

1029
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,630
inventive processes it's it's it's so

1030
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:55,420
cool

1031
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:57,550
yeah it's every year it's going up and

1032
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:00,369
like last year it was an amazing event

1033
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:02,710
and 135 people are something can fit in

1034
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:05,039
the archives and it's about full and

1035
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:07,809
then had to move here

1036
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:09,099
yeah I had to as it was moving

1037
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:10,809
I had to communicate with someone in

1038
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:13,000
town and I said hey man it's like

1039
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:14,889
Woodstock can't fight it we just got to

1040
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,260
keep growing it's this regenerative

1041
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:18,730
movement that you know Forbes is

1042
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,960
claiming it's in the top five there's

1043
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:22,599
cannabis and the regenerative

1044
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:28,840
agriculture and we're ground center

1045
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:31,449
right here like yeah so let's keep that

1046
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,039
like momentum moving let's connect with

1047
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:34,359
each other let's learn from every farm

1048
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,489
let's not think that we know everything

1049
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,710
cuz every time you connect with another

1050
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:39,969
smart individual they're gonna have

1051
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:41,349
another idea about something another

1052
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:43,619
perspective let's take all those

1053
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:46,750
perspectives in that's powerful and

1054
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:49,029
let's share the innovation I mean the

1055
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:51,010
main tool of it is us sharing as a

1056
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:52,450
community so thank you everyone for

1057
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:56,650
being here let's let's take this

1058
00:48:52,449 --> 00:48:58,449
movement as far as we can as far as the

1059
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,500
bureaucracy with with the food

1060
00:48:58,449 --> 00:49:02,079
production it's actually pretty

1061
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:05,289
straightforward being being a certified

1062
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:07,179
producer and unlike cannabis the the

1063
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:09,550
bureaucracy with food production is kind

1064
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:11,949
of a like okay here's your slip of paper

1065
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:13,810
there you go there's they're not they're

1066
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:16,029
not chasing you down and checking on

1067
00:49:13,809 --> 00:49:19,059
here in the same way no I don't think

1068
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:21,430
anybody in Humboldt County ever got AG

1069
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:23,079
exempt permit for a greenhouse on their

1070
00:49:21,429 --> 00:49:30,789
small farm before the cannabis thing

1071
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:34,539
came along yeah we do I was asking if he

1072
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:36,099
does fertility testing we about every

1073
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:38,860
third year we test our soil and just

1074
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:41,949
kind of see what what it's been up to

1075
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:43,570
and in which direction it's going kind

1076
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:46,089
of informs us how to make our compost

1077
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:49,240
and if we need to amend adjust pH and

1078
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:50,890
stuff like that but you know one thing I

1079
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:53,949
want to get back to for a second because

1080
00:49:50,889 --> 00:49:56,769
I had this thought well well Jesse was

1081
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:58,989
talking and talking about about the

1082
00:49:56,769 --> 00:50:01,869
climate and and about nitrogen

1083
00:49:58,989 --> 00:50:03,819
fertilizer and and I was just

1084
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:06,519
quantifying it recently for another talk

1085
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:08,350
I was doing in the the topsoil on this

1086
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:10,300
planet holds three times as much carbon

1087
00:50:08,349 --> 00:50:13,569
as the atmosphere as the entire

1088
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:15,280
atmosphere does so when you think about

1089
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:17,170
what we're doing and why we're doing it

1090
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,849
industrial agriculture

1091
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:23,260
is is making nitrogen fertilizer adding

1092
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:25,539
carbon to the atmosphere that way

1093
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,269
through fossil fuel adding nitrogen to

1094
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:30,160
the soil so that it burns up the carbon

1095
00:50:28,268 --> 00:50:34,449
in the soil and adds that to the

1096
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:38,469
atmosphere in addition so the soil on

1097
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:41,379
this planet has the ability to sequester

1098
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:43,179
all the carbon we need it to and and if

1099
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:47,019
our agriculture is doing the opposite

1100
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:49,389
it's a huge missed opportunity and and I

1101
00:50:47,018 --> 00:50:52,778
think at this point anything we do with

1102
00:50:49,389 --> 00:50:54,400
our with our productive lives at this

1103
00:50:52,778 --> 00:50:55,869
point that we can obviously we're all

1104
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,068
gonna be driving cars we're gonna be

1105
00:50:55,869 --> 00:50:58,690
doing this and that but if you're doing

1106
00:50:57,068 --> 00:51:05,259
agriculture anyway do it in a way that

1107
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:09,400
puts carbon in the soil and plant more

1108
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:11,710
plants just go buy plants everybody

1109
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,269
should be planting plants perennials we

1110
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:15,579
need perennial calories we need

1111
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:19,659
perennials everywhere there used to be

1112
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:22,539
so much perennials I mean there's 33

1113
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:24,219
million acres of Oaks in California and

1114
00:51:22,539 --> 00:51:28,180
how many of those acres are getting

1115
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:30,699
harvested just saying its food plants

1116
00:51:28,179 --> 00:51:32,048
are solar-powered carbon sequestering

1117
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:34,000
machines like we're talking about

1118
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:35,920
building carbon scrubbers and stuff it's

1119
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,230
like dude like yeah

1120
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,568
how about forests in grassland and you

1121
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:44,108
know well integrated natural systems and

1122
00:51:40,568 --> 00:51:45,670
regenerative agriculture yeah we need to

1123
00:51:44,108 --> 00:51:50,048
be putting it in the ground and there's

1124
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:53,920
recent math done that potentially shows

1125
00:51:50,048 --> 00:51:55,719
that if 10% of our AG lands convert over

1126
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:59,920
we will sequester more than what we

1127
00:51:55,719 --> 00:52:02,230
release that I think that's a doable

1128
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,849
thing go back to your question about

1129
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:06,159
cannabis and food actually one of the

1130
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:07,329
biggest regulatory burdens with cannabis

1131
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,460
and food is that I want to grow my

1132
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:11,200
cannabis like I grow my food and rotate

1133
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,980
my crop through my farm and that's

1134
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:16,960
nearly impossible because they're not

1135
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,940
treating cannabis like agriculture for

1136
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,670
the state I would have to redraw and

1137
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:26,550
resubmit a map and a different site plan

1138
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:35,010
each flipping year to move my cannabis

1139
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:36,600
through my phone yeah it's hard when the

1140
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:38,460
inspector comes they want a little box

1141
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:41,159
around it they can measure and they want

1142
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:46,139
it to be in the GPS points that it on

1143
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:48,829
the site that you had it on any other

1144
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:48,829
questions out there

1145
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:06,548
let's go right down and name six across

1146
00:53:03,518 --> 00:53:09,429
the board that you either resonate with

1147
00:53:06,548 --> 00:53:11,079
or that you find would be easy for

1148
00:53:09,429 --> 00:53:15,578
someone to identify on they're far more

1149
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:17,440
ready there's there's so much I mean

1150
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:19,778
like okay you grow your own food you eat

1151
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,369
it you use that energy to work soil to

1152
00:53:19,778 --> 00:53:28,329
grow your own food to eat it to use your

1153
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:31,119
energy where do you live you can make

1154
00:53:28,329 --> 00:53:33,818
compost you can make worms you can

1155
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:41,559
harvest water you can grow things you

1156
00:53:33,818 --> 00:53:43,960
can teach people things using the stalks

1157
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:54,670
and the rest of the plant has returned

1158
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:56,769
nutrients regenerative power solar and

1159
00:53:54,670 --> 00:54:00,880
wind you know that's a regenerative

1160
00:53:56,768 --> 00:54:03,689
system if you can localize that I argue

1161
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:07,028
that that is a almost sustainable system

1162
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:10,259
because the only actual solar power that

1163
00:54:07,028 --> 00:54:14,559
is regenerative is plants that's it

1164
00:54:10,259 --> 00:54:15,849
because that's that's you know you know

1165
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,490
it doesn't take power you don't have to

1166
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:20,200
mind anything there's no solar cells

1167
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:22,929
there's no batteries there's no like

1168
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:24,189
silicon and let the young being mind and

1169
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:25,899
there's huge issues with that I didn't

1170
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:27,849
everything being like shipped everywhere

1171
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:31,108
it's way better than the alternative but

1172
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:33,430
I just yeah plants are the only

1173
00:54:31,108 --> 00:54:36,788
regenerative solar powered thing for me

1174
00:54:33,429 --> 00:54:40,239
so cover cropping and mulching is big

1175
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:42,519
for me and also and and and care for the

1176
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:45,038
wildlands thinking about promoting

1177
00:54:42,518 --> 00:54:51,669
native diversity and taking care of your

1178
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:55,450
forests and watersheds well said

1179
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:59,950
we have a alpacas on our farm and they

1180
00:54:55,449 --> 00:55:03,639
work wonders with fertile fertility and

1181
00:54:59,949 --> 00:55:07,960
fire suppression and they're really easy

1182
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:13,509
animals to handle so I recommend having

1183
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:15,550
alpacas oh yeah yeah we have

1184
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:18,880
incorporated their manure into our by

1185
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:20,620
demmick compost piles now and spread

1186
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,019
their manure out through our whole

1187
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:27,389
garden so we've had him over a year now

1188
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:37,780
and last year was amazing

1189
00:55:27,389 --> 00:55:39,460
yeah with the amount of beautiful ganje

1190
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:43,240
that we produce oh yeah it was amazing

1191
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:45,460
oh my god it was such a treat walking

1192
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:46,929
onto their land you saw the videos well

1193
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:50,679
yeah but maybe we'll play it with the

1194
00:55:46,929 --> 00:55:53,769
audio here in a second but man just like

1195
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:55,449
I came to the front yard and I was

1196
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:56,590
already so stoked because like you were

1197
00:55:55,449 --> 00:55:57,939
saying like you know every plant is

1198
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:59,410
spent and it was like oh this is kind of

1199
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,210
how I do my garden where I don't do

1200
00:55:59,409 --> 00:56:03,219
anything and just like it's about the

1201
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:04,659
soil look how cool this is all these

1202
00:56:03,219 --> 00:56:06,609
weird things that are growing and like

1203
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:08,980
and it's a total mess but there's so

1204
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:12,550
much in there and so I was immediately

1205
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:14,199
just really happy with that you know you

1206
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:16,539
like natural garden in the front that

1207
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:18,489
had incredible soil and then we walked

1208
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:20,769
out back and was just like holy crap

1209
00:56:18,489 --> 00:56:23,439
look at these monsters like we were just

1210
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:25,719
like just towering beautiful happy

1211
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,659
plants that are grown in the soil now

1212
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:31,269
not tilled and biodynamic compost being

1213
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:34,659
made with their closed-loop systems with

1214
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:36,099
their animals and and and they're in

1215
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:37,420
covilhã too weather's about Namek

1216
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:39,159
community so it's actually crepes that

1217
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:40,900
are made in that area and the

1218
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:42,789
information sharing that happens with

1219
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:48,760
the biodynamic community there is really

1220
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:50,529
amazing and going to radical herbs was

1221
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,970
incredible to like those guys practice

1222
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:53,260
biodynamic sand cannabis

1223
00:56:51,969 --> 00:56:55,449
probably better than anyone I've ever

1224
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:57,100
seen it's like it's amazing the amount

1225
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:59,019
of food and they're one of the winners

1226
00:56:57,099 --> 00:57:00,969
of the award this year too and we'll go

1227
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:02,360
there we'll play there movie I'll play

1228
00:57:00,969 --> 00:57:05,359
there's actually next when

1229
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:07,250
yeah and and yeah she's having a getting

1230
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,740
close to having a child too so that's

1231
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:12,289
why they're not here right now but

1232
00:57:08,739 --> 00:57:14,239
amazing farms and and the genetics it

1233
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:16,489
actually like I was really impressed

1234
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:21,229
with your energy immediately like just

1235
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:23,899
having the the care for the earth and

1236
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:26,840
the passion and it you know resignate

1237
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:28,849
and you put ripples out and the moment I

1238
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:32,780
met you I was like oh yeah your plant

1239
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:35,299
too like I identify with plant people

1240
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:38,570
and and I immediately just felt his

1241
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:41,539
energy and was like yes plants like this

1242
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:45,350
person a lot that's a big deal you know

1243
00:57:41,539 --> 00:57:50,539
cannabis loves you it's so clear and you

1244
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:52,579
love it and it's awesome and ever and

1245
00:57:50,539 --> 00:57:53,869
the genetics like growing up with it

1246
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:55,489
like they were eating since he was a

1247
00:57:53,869 --> 00:57:58,099
child and paying attention since he's a

1248
00:57:55,489 --> 00:57:59,239
child and there's also really amazing

1249
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:01,250
thing going on with the genetics in

1250
00:57:59,239 --> 00:58:03,019
their community and kopelow to like the

1251
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:04,519
jaggu and the the shared we went to all

1252
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:06,050
these different farms and the work that

1253
00:58:04,519 --> 00:58:07,789
he's done with his brothers are all over

1254
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:09,920
the place and tomorrow we're gonna have

1255
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:12,199
a very special day of having some of the

1256
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:15,710
best breeders in the world like all here

1257
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:18,469
and getting to hear from them and like

1258
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:20,420
yeah so that community work of sharing

1259
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:22,879
genetics of talking about what works

1260
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:24,619
it's just so powerful that's one of our

1261
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,860
biggest tools and we can't lose that

1262
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:29,449
because that's that's diversity that's

1263
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:31,519
what cannabis wants us to be doing and

1264
00:58:29,449 --> 00:58:36,980
you know monocropping just OG for you

1265
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:39,800
know those days are over so hooray to

1266
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:41,480
answer the question you could do uh if

1267
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,100
you do breeding that's a closed loop if

1268
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,990
you save seeds that's a closed loop if

1269
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:47,179
you have a low for your clones that's a

1270
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:50,899
closed loop if you have an orchard

1271
00:58:47,179 --> 00:58:53,269
that's a closed loop so you know like

1272
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:55,130
the concept of a closed loop is like it

1273
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:57,349
stays here and it goes in a circle and

1274
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:59,480
so we have to like break that every now

1275
00:58:57,349 --> 00:59:01,519
and then and it's okay to do that

1276
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,380
because that's how you get your weed out

1277
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:05,900
into the world is breaking that loop so

1278
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:08,269
it's it's that's like we use these terms

1279
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:11,750
and it's it's very loose and just kind

1280
00:59:08,269 --> 00:59:13,280
of fluid so those are some easy closed

1281
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:15,079
loops that pretty much anyone could do

1282
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,710
if you have an oak tree in your yard you

1283
00:59:15,079 --> 00:59:18,900
can collect the

1284
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:25,230
the leaves and you know it's there's so

1285
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:27,180
many things you can do so we're gonna

1286
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:28,280
we're gonna have Patricia identify some

1287
00:59:27,179 --> 00:59:30,719
more here

1288
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,670
so those of you who like to write things

1289
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:34,739
down cuz I would be I was taking notes

1290
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:37,409
all weekend I'm gonna list off so

1291
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:40,078
closed-loop systems incorporating what's

1292
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:43,049
on your farm so use what you have

1293
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:46,140
and be be resourceful go out there

1294
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:47,880
listen to the plants take step - okay so

1295
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:50,159
we got closed-loop systems we're also

1296
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:52,559
talking about water conservation in any

1297
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:54,838
way or form that works in your local

1298
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:58,680
area know what your watersheds are

1299
00:59:54,838 --> 01:00:00,929
connect with your water that's near you

1300
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:04,710
know what's going on brings me to a

1301
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:07,348
three local community support so every

1302
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:09,179
drop of money I've ever made in cannabis

1303
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:10,680
has gone back to my community the

1304
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:16,318
village hearth cooperative which I've

1305
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:19,318
talked about is it's a non-profit Cafe

1306
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:20,940
and apothecary and art supporter that

1307
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:22,558
I'm just giving money back to my

1308
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:24,838
community because investing in your

1309
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:27,030
local area investing in your not just

1310
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:29,849
your local land not just with your

1311
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:31,079
family but like moving on bit to bigger

1312
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:33,660
community get to know those people

1313
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:35,519
around you because that is that's your

1314
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:37,170
bigger family and we're building up

1315
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:40,048
resilience together when we come

1316
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:44,909
together so get on the same page another

1317
01:00:40,048 --> 01:00:48,838
one is so many I have a really cool one

1318
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:50,848
actually when you mention the heart when

1319
01:00:48,838 --> 01:00:53,039
we went to radical herbs one of the

1320
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:55,140
things that they're doing is they raise

1321
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:57,690
meat birds and we were eating those

1322
01:00:55,139 --> 01:00:59,578
those birds in the food that we had

1323
01:00:57,690 --> 01:01:01,920
there and that was really really cool

1324
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:04,559
like oh wow these came from the farm

1325
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,599
that we were just that well as they're

1326
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,240
raising these meat birds they're moving

1327
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:11,400
them down the line and that's the

1328
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:13,289
fertility and they move it before they

1329
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:16,139
do too much disturbance but all these

1330
01:01:13,289 --> 01:01:18,210
these chickens are are pooping and

1331
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:20,578
putting fertility right back in an area

1332
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:22,619
that they are gonna grow cannabis and I

1333
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:26,548
think that's pretty amazing like reading

1334
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:28,530
the bird like was was grown that way and

1335
01:01:26,548 --> 01:01:29,889
they also take that bone meal and

1336
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:35,380
process it in

1337
01:01:29,889 --> 01:01:36,940
and turn it into nutrition using yeah

1338
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:38,950
perhaps that actually stuff you could

1339
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:41,800
probably learn from the flower days book

1340
01:01:38,949 --> 01:01:43,210
as well I I thought that was a really

1341
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:46,240
cool closed-loop system though that

1342
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:46,780
we're eating it I was gonna add one more

1343
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:49,329
thing

1344
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:51,370
there's devices you can buy if people

1345
01:01:49,329 --> 01:01:53,019
are familiar with flow forms it

1346
01:01:51,369 --> 01:01:54,400
structures the water before you use it

1347
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:57,009
you can actually you can actually buy

1348
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:00,809
inline flow forms and that structures

1349
01:01:57,010 --> 01:02:04,630
the water and your water usage goes down

1350
01:02:00,809 --> 01:02:06,519
unbelievable and on our farm we invested

1351
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:10,090
about two thousand dollars and we had

1352
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:12,400
these systems put in and it's absolutely

1353
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:16,090
stunning how much less water you need so

1354
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,650
if anyone's water poverty or just has

1355
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:19,990
doesn't have that much water or wants to

1356
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:22,420
conserve water it's really worth looking

1357
01:02:19,989 --> 01:02:23,799
at these devices because it's not you

1358
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:25,840
know it's not that much money to spend

1359
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,300
to save you know I I could pretty much

1360
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:30,519
say 50% less water and I'd be pretty

1361
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,080
confident with that and for the first

1362
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:33,639
couple weeks I was over watering and I

1363
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:36,610
called the owner of the company and I

1364
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:40,809
said what's going on here he says stop

1365
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:44,019
watering so I was good about once a week

1366
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:47,219
out water my big plants in the heat of

1367
01:02:44,019 --> 01:02:49,989
summer in Mendocino for some context

1368
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:51,939
your flowers are crazy tasty too like

1369
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:54,579
the terpenes that come out of that like

1370
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:56,139
the less water the herbs that you're

1371
01:02:54,579 --> 01:02:58,420
growing the the ferments that you're

1372
01:02:56,139 --> 01:03:01,210
making with them like really nice turkey

1373
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:03,159
flowers and putting that we learned that

1374
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:06,490
if you drought your plants out towards

1375
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:08,649
the end got that distress if you do it

1376
01:03:06,489 --> 01:03:11,229
right you can you can reduce your yield

1377
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:12,970
by a little bit but if you do it right

1378
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:14,619
it's not that big of a deal but you do

1379
01:03:12,969 --> 01:03:18,009
get a really rich terpene profile

1380
01:03:14,619 --> 01:03:20,739
through that dry stress as a plant is

1381
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:22,660
like stressing out and it's talking it's

1382
01:03:20,739 --> 01:03:25,029
yelling to all her friends there's no

1383
01:03:22,659 --> 01:03:27,519
water and that's you know you always say

1384
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:29,140
that aloud knows and that's why it's

1385
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:31,659
loud is because it's literally talking

1386
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:33,969
I'm thirsty

1387
01:03:31,659 --> 01:03:38,469
so don't water your plants at the end

1388
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:40,809
and it's really nice I would say for me

1389
01:03:38,469 --> 01:03:42,989
one of the clothes loops are one of the

1390
01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:46,299
things I really like to

1391
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:49,239
explore my farm is how I can build soil

1392
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:50,740
and how can I utilize some of the things

1393
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:52,809
I already have on my farm like Patricia

1394
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:56,379
was saying and one of the things we use

1395
01:03:52,809 --> 01:03:57,730
for storing our cannabis at harvest when

1396
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:59,740
it's before it leaves the farm is

1397
01:03:57,730 --> 01:04:01,929
cardboard boxes so we're putting those

1398
01:03:59,739 --> 01:04:04,479
cardboard boxes down in our pathways

1399
01:04:01,929 --> 01:04:09,819
we're putting our wood chip over that

1400
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:13,289
and what I've really seen and is the

1401
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:15,850
missile iam just runs I mean it just

1402
01:04:13,289 --> 01:04:17,710
inoculate a little bit with kingster

1403
01:04:15,849 --> 01:04:20,139
Ferrier or some of the other mushroom

1404
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:22,090
blocks that I get and we were pulling

1405
01:04:20,139 --> 01:04:24,579
some back today we did a little farm

1406
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:26,019
tour this morning and it's incredible

1407
01:04:24,579 --> 01:04:27,819
like Elaine was saying you could pick it

1408
01:04:26,019 --> 01:04:30,070
up and it's it's like a wind chime it's

1409
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:34,330
grabbing those pieces of wood woody

1410
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:36,490
material and we have you know some of us

1411
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:38,590
in Humble County and and parts amend oh

1412
01:04:36,489 --> 01:04:39,489
we have this agroforestry model that is

1413
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:43,600
so rich

1414
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:45,519
we've endless biomass constantly and to

1415
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:47,170
the point that it's sloughing onto our

1416
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:49,570
roads in the form of like fractured

1417
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:52,059
shale that we would normally push aside

1418
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:54,580
and cast away but now that is such a

1419
01:04:52,059 --> 01:04:58,299
light loose material we're adding that

1420
01:04:54,579 --> 01:05:00,369
to our beds and that is gonna provide

1421
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:02,500
food for food for our plants and

1422
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:04,809
microbes break it down and it really

1423
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:07,358
would replace something that aerates and

1424
01:05:04,809 --> 01:05:09,909
holds structure so that's one of the

1425
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:12,819
things we're doing and it really is

1426
01:05:09,909 --> 01:05:15,699
rewarding building that soil and closing

1427
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:18,160
that loop in that fashion and you know I

1428
01:05:15,699 --> 01:05:19,239
want to talk about well take on some

1429
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:22,569
more questions but one of the things

1430
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:24,368
that Josh and Kelly were pushing at that

1431
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:26,200
first living soils was stop spending

1432
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:28,150
money that was the second living soil a

1433
01:05:26,199 --> 01:05:32,769
second living so yes stop spending money

1434
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:35,920
and and they were dead serious about it

1435
01:05:32,769 --> 01:05:37,539
and I wish I would have slowed sooner

1436
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,329
because so much got taken out during

1437
01:05:37,539 --> 01:05:42,279
compliance and then last year's

1438
01:05:40,329 --> 01:05:43,809
messaging was okay we stop spending

1439
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,460
money we're trying to figure this out

1440
01:05:43,809 --> 01:05:47,980
plant more food plant more food plant

1441
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:50,590
more food and and I think the messaging

1442
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:53,559
this year what I'm seeing with the

1443
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:56,079
collective being formed and that's we

1444
01:05:53,559 --> 01:05:58,360
need to hold hands we need to form

1445
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:59,920
stronger communities and you can see how

1446
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,720
this has grown last year we're in the

1447
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,570
Octagon and it would have been just the

1448
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:06,819
first three rows and how this is growing

1449
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:09,880
and and this word can spread quickly and

1450
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:12,820
and and it's challenging at first

1451
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:15,160
getting the momentum going in a

1452
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:17,350
community until you hold those first

1453
01:06:15,159 --> 01:06:19,389
couple gatherings barbecues whatever

1454
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:20,920
excuses to get together this time of

1455
01:06:19,389 --> 01:06:23,289
year it's great to do seed swap in

1456
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,849
general and and that really brings

1457
01:06:23,289 --> 01:06:26,110
people together it can be on a tailgate

1458
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:27,699
at first and then before you know you're

1459
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:30,010
meeting at some space and it's much

1460
01:06:27,699 --> 01:06:32,049
larger but I just wanted to share that

1461
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:34,360
and and the working together is really

1462
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:37,000
crucial right now that that's gonna

1463
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:39,269
really help us all any more questions

1464
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,730
out there have you used your cannabis

1465
01:06:39,269 --> 01:06:47,170
stalk leaf material to feed cattle or

1466
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:49,030
animals our alpacas actually love to

1467
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:50,200
help us like pluck leaves if you let

1468
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:51,280
them walk around they'll pluck leaves

1469
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:53,049
I've heard them doing that in other

1470
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,510
gardens but when we're out there

1471
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:56,890
harvesting they'll eat all the leaves

1472
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:58,810
think so

1473
01:06:56,889 --> 01:07:02,949
I know a pakka's lovelies and another

1474
01:06:58,809 --> 01:07:05,590
way that you can utilize those materials

1475
01:07:02,949 --> 01:07:07,480
your stock and every part of the plant

1476
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:10,180
you should be utilizing back into your

1477
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:13,750
garden those stalks make awesome wood

1478
01:07:10,179 --> 01:07:16,629
chips the roots are medicinal the whole

1479
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:17,590
plant should be used that's another part

1480
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:19,059
of dump yours

1481
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:20,860
there's no waste on the farm because

1482
01:07:19,059 --> 01:07:23,529
there doesn't need to be everything is

1483
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:25,780
is part of the system that you're

1484
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:28,120
creating and to close that loop in that

1485
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:30,310
way it just makes your farm so much

1486
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:32,409
stronger and saves you so much money

1487
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:35,739
I think goats would like the stalks

1488
01:07:32,409 --> 01:07:38,559
better than cows would to be honest yeah

1489
01:07:35,739 --> 01:07:41,349
and go ahead chow down on the stalks the

1490
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:43,539
leaves whatever good fences keep them

1491
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:46,059
from doing it too soon yeah and this

1492
01:07:43,539 --> 01:07:49,329
made me think about one of the things

1493
01:07:46,059 --> 01:07:53,170
that we I'm sure we all do is we don't

1494
01:07:49,329 --> 01:07:56,110
pull our stalks and our roots out of the

1495
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:58,019
ground we we leave that just to just

1496
01:07:56,110 --> 01:08:02,890
stay in the soil and not to serve that

1497
01:07:58,019 --> 01:08:05,199
micro Raizel zone and yeah so if you

1498
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:06,879
think about it and jesse is probably

1499
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:07,719
i'll let you share your last bit because

1500
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,900
i know it

1501
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:13,989
but on my farm for instance yeah will

1502
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:15,700
will break all the material down we have

1503
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:17,469
run it fruit through a chipper what

1504
01:08:15,699 --> 01:08:19,659
we're trying to but then we're burning

1505
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:21,369
fuel but we're trying to take the

1506
01:08:19,659 --> 01:08:23,528
smaller branches and put them deeper

1507
01:08:21,369 --> 01:08:25,390
into as a first layer of our compost

1508
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:29,259
area and build on top of that and we use

1509
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:30,789
that as the aeration and then yeah we

1510
01:08:29,259 --> 01:08:31,988
some of the bigger stock though we run

1511
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:33,369
through the chipper and we'll chip that

1512
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:35,318
right in place and keep that in the

1513
01:08:33,369 --> 01:08:38,229
aisle space or wherever you might need

1514
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:40,270
so all that leaves my farm is just the

1515
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:41,709
flour and Jesse can brag a little deeper

1516
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:43,089
than that oh well I think you're gonna

1517
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:48,640
talk about I was gonna talk about joshan

1518
01:08:43,088 --> 01:08:50,019
washing no but what I was gonna say is

1519
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,900
when the lame is that you're talking

1520
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:54,640
about her pulling up really really

1521
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:56,409
strong mycelium where it's like holding

1522
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,838
on to the woodchips and that's Jeff area

1523
01:08:56,409 --> 01:09:01,838
I'm assuming because that's a really

1524
01:08:58,838 --> 01:09:04,298
strong mycelium mr. Ferriero so any Lita

1525
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:07,689
it's the also known as the garden giant

1526
01:09:04,298 --> 01:09:09,399
or king stropharia or wine cap there's a

1527
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:10,659
picture here it's hard to you're not

1528
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:12,789
going to be able to totally see it but

1529
01:09:10,659 --> 01:09:14,559
there's a whole bunch of them sprouting

1530
01:09:12,789 --> 01:09:18,759
out and that's a cannabis stock next to

1531
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:22,080
it and it loves to eat cannabis chips or

1532
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:25,000
stocks also stocks are really useful for

1533
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:26,738
building compost aeration you guys do a

1534
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,649
good job of that I've been doing that

1535
01:09:26,738 --> 01:09:31,959
for years I like the Peter Procter style

1536
01:09:29,649 --> 01:09:33,939
of biodynamic compost building where you

1537
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:37,119
make kind of an air tunnel and using

1538
01:09:33,939 --> 01:09:38,829
what you have on site so like whether

1539
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:40,659
it's just branches from doing some

1540
01:09:38,829 --> 01:09:42,399
cleanup but cannabis stocks are so good

1541
01:09:40,659 --> 01:09:45,159
and the worms love it and the mycelium

1542
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:48,369
loves it but yeah if you if you have

1543
01:09:45,159 --> 01:09:49,750
strife area to you feed you feed your

1544
01:09:48,369 --> 01:09:51,849
cannabis to that they don't eat it real

1545
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:54,189
quick and then they produce really tasty

1546
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:56,350
mushrooms to you well yeah they're

1547
01:09:54,189 --> 01:09:59,049
really good like you know these guys

1548
01:09:56,350 --> 01:10:01,120
mentioned roots and I bet you know both

1549
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:04,239
these Casey and Daniel and you know

1550
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:06,130
we're all growing companions but with

1551
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:07,809
root exudates we've learned is if you

1552
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:10,449
have if you are going to be doing the

1553
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:13,000
Secession of planting of say vegetables

1554
01:10:10,448 --> 01:10:14,919
or or lettuces next year cannabis if you

1555
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,550
if you have the if the baby root

1556
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,899
exudates

1557
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:18,760
the the

1558
01:10:16,899 --> 01:10:20,710
the vegging root exudates and the

1559
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,390
flowering reed x8 so you always have a

1560
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:23,890
little bit of all of them happening

1561
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:25,990
throughout the time you know you're

1562
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:28,539
you're you're leaning towards optimum

1563
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:30,460
and just having one is fine that's great

1564
01:10:28,539 --> 01:10:32,260
you're getting exudates but I'm sure he

1565
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:34,029
Lane talked about that and I'm no expert

1566
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:36,400
on it but but we have learned that

1567
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:39,219
having different age plants within your

1568
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:41,170
cannabis network is really cool so like

1569
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:43,590
so some of the things if you guys want

1570
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:45,819
to do some cool things is having

1571
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:48,970
perennial plants planted around your

1572
01:10:45,819 --> 01:10:52,029
cannabis whether they're next to it

1573
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:54,190
underneath it or in the vicinity having

1574
01:10:52,029 --> 01:10:55,359
these ecosystems is really going to pay

1575
01:10:54,189 --> 01:10:56,949
off in the long run and if you're

1576
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:58,839
growing in greenhouses you can just put

1577
01:10:56,949 --> 01:11:01,119
them around the greenhouses and there's

1578
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:03,090
really clever things to do and it's

1579
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:06,460
actually gonna grow you better weed so

1580
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:08,440
it's pretty easy to go buy some native

1581
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:12,189
perennial plants that have flowers on

1582
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:13,659
them so I'll just explain the exudates

1583
01:11:12,189 --> 01:11:16,779
for a second just in case anyone doesn't

1584
01:11:13,659 --> 01:11:18,880
know that but uh so plants taking in

1585
01:11:16,779 --> 01:11:22,149
that photo energy they're able to

1586
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:23,590
produce different foods basically like

1587
01:11:22,149 --> 01:11:25,599
carbs that they can feed to the

1588
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:27,420
microorganisms right along the

1589
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:31,390
rhizosphere that the microbes that are

1590
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:33,369
near the roots and by releasing exudates

1591
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:34,869
full of different foods they can

1592
01:11:33,369 --> 01:11:37,090
actually promote different microbial

1593
01:11:34,869 --> 01:11:39,220
populations and then those are going to

1594
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:41,230
be what's mineralizing what's in the

1595
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:43,060
soil to bring out further nutrition so

1596
01:11:41,229 --> 01:11:44,739
being able to produce good exudates is

1597
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:46,570
very important and if you don't want to

1598
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:48,729
do that just mulch the heck out of your

1599
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:50,979
soil and you know there's so many things

1600
01:11:48,729 --> 01:11:53,429
we can do that are really leaning in

1601
01:11:50,979 --> 01:11:53,429
that right direction

1602
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:18,569
we we used a small flower called a

1603
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:20,610
Garrard 'm in our greenhouses this last

1604
01:12:18,569 --> 01:12:23,130
year and it's a it's a really good

1605
01:12:20,609 --> 01:12:26,130
flower pollen food for beneficial

1606
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:30,000
insects and for pollinators it's low

1607
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:32,220
growing we saw no root competition no

1608
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,510
issue with what it was taking from from

1609
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:37,949
the cannabis plants and we kind of put

1610
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:40,110
it on the the southern edges of some of

1611
01:12:37,949 --> 01:12:42,029
our beds under under the shade under the

1612
01:12:40,109 --> 01:12:43,859
canopy of the cannabis but you know in a

1613
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:46,170
greenhouse you have enough light

1614
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:48,389
diffusion that everything get get some

1615
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:52,079
Sun but it beautiful little purple

1616
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:56,970
flowers grew about 12 inches tall or so

1617
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:58,619
and and I know they do if they're near

1618
01:12:56,970 --> 01:13:00,300
cannabis they're gonna get as much water

1619
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:02,640
as they want and they didn't seem like

1620
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:06,390
they took water from the cannabis but I

1621
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:09,780
did notice a lot of like like Sifford

1622
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:12,420
flies and predatory wasps and stuff like

1623
01:13:09,779 --> 01:13:13,829
that often often eating off of them so I

1624
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:16,170
felt like they were doing what I put

1625
01:13:13,829 --> 01:13:18,359
them there for and that's the idea of

1626
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:20,909
having like all the different colors and

1627
01:13:18,359 --> 01:13:24,569
sizes and shapes cuz like that you'll

1628
01:13:20,909 --> 01:13:26,250
see very small insects on things that

1629
01:13:24,569 --> 01:13:28,979
you're not gonna see on other plants and

1630
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:31,500
and then figure out what plants that you

1631
01:13:28,979 --> 01:13:33,619
want on the the periphery on the outside

1632
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:36,060
of your garden to keep things there

1633
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:39,569
versus having it in the middle of your

1634
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:43,130
garden and you know cilantro is a great

1635
01:13:39,569 --> 01:13:45,989
one a list like the really small flowers

1636
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:48,119
valerian yarrow is great but I would put

1637
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:51,119
that on the periphery chamomile is

1638
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:53,340
absolutely amazing not only can you

1639
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:55,829
harvest it and use it we use it provide

1640
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:57,659
a dynamic perhaps one of its jobs in the

1641
01:13:55,829 --> 01:14:00,329
garden is to increase resin production

1642
01:13:57,659 --> 01:14:02,159
so why wouldn't you do that

1643
01:14:00,329 --> 01:14:04,890
that was what the one that we did have

1644
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:07,050
issues with for competition but again we

1645
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:09,539
are growing like one out sea of green

1646
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:11,039
plants so it's slightly different

1647
01:14:09,539 --> 01:14:14,989
context but if you're growing bigger

1648
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:14,989
plants you would go for it

1649
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:23,420
he was asking where it was and the the

1650
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:26,569
chamomile plant was on the bottom edge

1651
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:30,289
of the where the walkway transitioned to

1652
01:14:26,569 --> 01:14:32,149
the bed so like a foot away but in the

1653
01:14:30,289 --> 01:14:41,539
ground and not in the bed and there's

1654
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:43,099
obviously a half-size plant I'm just

1655
01:14:41,539 --> 01:14:44,988
gonna say two with Europe with your

1656
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:47,920
gardens you can experiment probably with

1657
01:14:44,988 --> 01:14:50,750
anything and try like low growing foods

1658
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,219
some like herbs like cilantro you

1659
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:55,760
mentioned that will bolt pretty quickly

1660
01:14:52,219 --> 01:14:59,149
or spinach things that need that are

1661
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,800
shady small and are still gonna allow

1662
01:14:59,149 --> 01:15:03,409
you to have enough room and just play

1663
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:07,489
with it and definitely lots of herbs all

1664
01:15:03,409 --> 01:15:10,069
those fragrant flowery oily herbs and

1665
01:15:07,488 --> 01:15:13,579
depending on the effect you're going for

1666
01:15:10,069 --> 01:15:16,729
too you can design your companion

1667
01:15:13,579 --> 01:15:19,659
planting system or around your needs so

1668
01:15:16,729 --> 01:15:22,519
for instance you you can get a good

1669
01:15:19,659 --> 01:15:24,439
annual seed mix that's a mix of flowers

1670
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:27,260
especially tailored towards beneficial

1671
01:15:24,439 --> 01:15:29,629
insects and those you don't need to grow

1672
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:32,329
them under your cannabis but if they're

1673
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:35,210
you know every so often throughout your

1674
01:15:32,329 --> 01:15:38,149
farms because their purpose is that that

1675
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:39,739
they're a place that these these insects

1676
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:41,299
that are beneficial can go to four

1677
01:15:39,738 --> 01:15:42,709
different parts of their lifecycle can

1678
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:45,170
go do to eat so that doesn't need to

1679
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:46,880
necessarily be under your cannabis plant

1680
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:48,350
competing with its root space to have

1681
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,480
the desired effect of adding the

1682
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:52,429
biodiversity that supports the insect

1683
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:56,289
life you're looking for like in an IPM

1684
01:15:52,429 --> 01:15:58,340
program our favorite companion is

1685
01:15:56,289 --> 01:15:59,719
potatoes we like putting those in the

1686
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:02,270
root zone and around the bigger plants

1687
01:15:59,719 --> 01:16:03,739
will come off about 18 inches from each

1688
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:06,500
plant and put them in the four

1689
01:16:03,738 --> 01:16:08,059
directions so we can after harvest we

1690
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:10,039
can literally forget about them and go

1691
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:12,010
back to those stalks and dig those up

1692
01:16:10,039 --> 01:16:14,420
and it's a fun thing for my family to do

1693
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:17,210
Tulsi is amazing everybody should have

1694
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:19,250
told see it smells amazing and the

1695
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:25,250
amount of insects on it in the fall is

1696
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:26,989
stunning Tulsi holy basil and if you

1697
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:29,239
have this queen of herbs

1698
01:16:26,989 --> 01:16:31,819
you should dedicate if you entered in a

1699
01:16:29,239 --> 01:16:33,380
greenhouse dedicate a garden bed to food

1700
01:16:31,819 --> 01:16:36,229
and medicine if you don't want it to

1701
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:38,210
compete you know have other plants in

1702
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:39,889
your gardens other than cannabis is

1703
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:42,289
gonna help you with your pests it's

1704
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:43,880
gonna help with the overall beneficial

1705
01:16:42,289 --> 01:16:45,680
insects that you're bringing in and by

1706
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:48,319
the way there's so many more beneficial

1707
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:50,090
insects and there are of bad ones so

1708
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:52,069
when you do find bugs or something's a

1709
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:54,260
problem I just am touching on that

1710
01:16:52,069 --> 01:16:56,809
quickly that there's something you can

1711
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:58,430
use naturally you don't have to kill

1712
01:16:56,810 --> 01:17:01,480
everything in your garden because then

1713
01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:04,340
you kill all the good stuff too so I

1714
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:05,750
love yarrow sir all we mentioned already

1715
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:06,800
mentioned its but I wanted to double

1716
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,359
down on it and it comes in so many

1717
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:11,510
different colors too so you get that

1718
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:13,699
aspect and it's also a native and I also

1719
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:15,560
would encourage everyone to get to know

1720
01:17:13,699 --> 01:17:18,139
anyone doing native plant nurseries in

1721
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:21,080
your area and figure out what the actual

1722
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:23,450
insects in your area need and what you

1723
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:25,250
know you can be doing to help the

1724
01:17:23,449 --> 01:17:28,489
biodiversity in your area because the

1725
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:30,800
more we lose the natives like then these

1726
01:17:28,489 --> 01:17:32,809
very specific insects that are keeping

1727
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,640
certain things in balance no longer can

1728
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:35,970
feed in the way that they have evolved

1729
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,259
to thank you guys

1730
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:38,259
[Applause]
