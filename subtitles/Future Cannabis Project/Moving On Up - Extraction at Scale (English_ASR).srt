1
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:13,888
what the heck is a PhD doing in the

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,160
cannabis industry well there's actually

3
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:19,169
a lot more of us than you'd think my

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,370
journey was kind of accidental one on

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:27,020
purpose I had actually left chemistry

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:29,520
for a bit and I was I was an MRI tech

7
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:30,809
you make a lot more money as an MRI tech

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,590
than you do and as an adjunct lecturer

9
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:37,229
but but I always miss chemistry

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,420
I was always committed to medicine and I

11
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:42,750
really really really like the smell of

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,850
weed really really really I think I have

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,238
someone yeah a little Roman therapy on

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,870
my fingers there and so I decided to

15
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,949
take a plunge and just go out there and

16
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:55,049
Nate Ferguson over there gave me a

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,940
chance said you know we're gonna bring

18
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:59,988
this guy on board and see what he can do

19
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,339
so it's been an adventure since then and

20
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:06,298
let's go ahead and get started with the

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,840
talk get the slides okay looks like I

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,840
have the slides

23
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:43,390
okay so until very recently most of you

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,230
if you knew about me knew me as dr. Jack

25
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,460
Hughes a little bitty Instagram page and

26
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,170
because of I'm in it in my medical

27
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:50,769
connection I could not reveal my real

28
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,609
name

29
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:56,229
even though Kaiser will actually

30
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:58,510
prescribe cannabis to dying patients

31
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:03,010
they won't let MRI techs who use

32
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:04,420
cannabis be employed there so you know

33
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,219
that's what's that is my name is Wyeth

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,969
Calloway like I said we're going to talk

35
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:11,439
about the study in the expansion of

36
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:13,780
production through technical

37
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,430
improvements and innovations so Geddy's

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,310
changed a lot since I first walked in

39
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,780
the door and it's not just been me it's

40
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,990
been a team I just want to emphasize an

41
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,210
entire time I've been kind of like let's

42
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,760
let's let's make the nerd analogy to the

43
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,570
Starship Enterprise I'm pretty much like

44
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,769
Spock

45
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:37,209
okay so I will you know say things like

46
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:41,290
this is an illogical course I am 100%

47
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:46,180
certain this will fail things like that

48
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:53,680
so let's let's move forward where's my

49
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:56,680
clicker there we go so so here's Jenny

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,680
this is some pictures of jetty who we

51
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,770
are and right up there is our nice

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,219
reception room here is my a messy R&amp;D

53
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:09,159
corner and this is actually a column for

54
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:12,849
column chromatography you know I like to

55
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:15,400
run kilo scale and over here is what

56
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:17,859
used to be the rotovap area so talk more

57
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,069
about that and last but not least is the

58
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,530
bee who greeted me on my first day at

59
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:27,819
jetty when I didn't even know what honey

60
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:29,199
oil meant so it was very ironic okay I

61
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:35,319
know what bubble hash was I've been

62
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:44,609
making bubble hash here we go so who are

63
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:47,229
we so we started in 2013 this started in

64
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:50,530
2017 r-13 and were founded by a group of

65
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:51,099
surfers in San Diego so Nate Ferguson

66
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,659
Matt Lee

67
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:57,039
the Rob Ferguson and ronger Shoni okay

68
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,349
we were about a hundred thousand in

69
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,299
revenue in that first year since then

70
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:03,849
we've roughly doubled more more or less

71
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,189
every year we're a distillates and

72
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:08,710
concentrate company and one of our

73
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:11,199
trademarks is up there you can see the

74
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:14,349
tops water clear pen the trademark is

75
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:17,860
actually the cedar the the sandalwood

76
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:19,509
tip so sandalwood is very renewable in

77
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,280
terms of a tip most places have metal or

78
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,709
plastic so that's one of our signature

79
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,719
jetty things the next thing is an

80
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:30,549
applicator the dab locator is a way of

81
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,960
dabbing that you can allows you to

82
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,470
control a little bit more than sticking

83
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:37,120
a scoop into you know a little jar and

84
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,680
then just tapping that so you know it's

85
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,930
got a little clicking mechanism and you

86
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,709
can more or less get a decent dose it's

87
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,689
a little cleaner so really great product

88
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:50,259
okay the last thing I want to talk about

89
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:53,050
jetty who are we the shelter project so

90
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:56,289
the shelter project is a compassionate

91
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:59,829
care program started in 2014 by our own

92
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:02,160
Lindsay Friedman and at one point we had

93
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:04,300
a thousand patients that we were giving

94
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,620
formulated or unform elated cannabis

95
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,350
medicine - for free

96
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:13,750
we gave her a over a million dollars in

97
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:17,230
free merchandise free product and you

98
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:20,079
know unfortunately SB 64 decided that

99
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,610
they would impose a tax on donated goods

100
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,349
and this really affected compassionate

101
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,699
care probably some of you out there

102
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,100
actually know about this

103
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,180
so Lindsay's first efforts and

104
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,030
everybody's first efforts actually

105
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,920
failed uncovered on Jerry Brown's desk

106
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:37,059
he vetoed the first compassionate care

107
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:41,050
bill and now we've got SB 34 in the

108
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:44,139
works so call your Congressman Congress

109
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,160
person and tell them you support SB 34

110
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,110
because that's gonna make things more

111
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,939
rational we're not going to be able to

112
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,170
have to pay taxes it's gonna be a lot

113
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:53,860
more easy to remote people in the

114
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,600
program so I don't know if anybody's a

115
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,189
fan of jeti but did you know he used to

116
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:03,689
make edibles and they were from

117
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:06,399
2016-2017 called skews

118
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:09,250
Jenny mine tricks okay

119
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,689
and that's cannabis infused toffee and I

120
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,899
have no idea

121
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:15,579
to this day how they got the name

122
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:17,439
perhaps opium on here could tell you

123
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:18,000
these are not the droids you're looking

124
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,949
for

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,089
Jedi Mind Tricks okay I actually do know

126
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:27,579
so what am I going to talk about today

127
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:30,129
cannabis cannabis distillate production

128
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:31,899
the it's basically what we do and this

129
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:33,790
is sort of a summary I feel like I'm

130
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:35,500
preaching to the choir here probably

131
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,720
absolutely everybody in the room knows

132
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,850
everything about this topic but

133
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,340
nonetheless here we go

134
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,370
so it's first step is biomass

135
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:47,049
preparation then we have extraction

136
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,930
winterization filtration and

137
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,790
concentration decarboxylation which a

138
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,579
lot of people just call D carb but it's

139
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:56,230
also a D volatilization process we have

140
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:58,930
final distillation of the cannabinoids

141
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,670
and then as a side note we have actually

142
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,800
cannabis essential oil production and

143
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,480
this isn't really necessary to the

144
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,180
distillate market because there exist

145
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,569
all sorts of flavor elements that are

146
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,430
out there including fake plant derived

147
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:15,009
terpene profiles which will have the

148
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,590
name of a king of cannabis Kiev are you

149
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:20,680
all probably know about that so here are

150
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:22,418
a few examples of my work on the top

151
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,668
left there is God Only Knows I believe

152
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:28,060
it's reclaim not super proud of that

153
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:30,639
color the next is our d8 Reserve Delta a

154
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,589
pretty high ratio there and then the

155
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:37,029
last is the water clear delta line in

156
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:41,489
the corner there so who worried before I

157
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:41,489
came to jetty we were prop 215 compliant

158
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:49,719
okay we're using co2 supercritical fluid

159
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,418
extraction and ethanol extraction

160
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,820
capabilities at that time for the

161
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:56,560
winterization slash precipitation we had

162
00:07:54,819 --> 00:08:00,610
a cold room we had to do carbon

163
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,350
scrubbing we did vacuum filtration with

164
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,750
large fretted funnels I'm sure you've

165
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,840
all seen these Buechner funnels that

166
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,418
kind of things a little bit of iteration

167
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,799
we had one small rotovap at first for

168
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:15,609
the co2 we just needed a light

169
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,810
winterization and you know you've heard

170
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,120
the story about a thousand

171
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,530
he's with thousand typewriters and you

172
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,930
know they can write the perfect novel

173
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:24,638
well early in the early days of cannabis

174
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,199
you know what I've seen and been told is

175
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,879
basically if you had a machine and it

176
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,099
was working you just bought five more of

177
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:34,000
them you know and that that would do it

178
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,830
so we started with that then we were

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,899
doing a manual decarboxylation we

180
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,629
weren't d volatilizing at that point and

181
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:44,019
we had a two inch Pope's a white film

182
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:45,759
system we had to do two passes so I

183
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:47,559
wanted to remove the quote unquote Terp

184
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,830
fraction talk about that a little more

185
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,838
later and we had done some research on

186
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,420
short path distillation but never used a

187
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,740
production and initially short path was

188
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:59,199
how I learned to deal with all of you

189
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,629
pretty much knew how to do before I was

190
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,879
you know cannabis was a twinkle in my

191
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:05,769
eye or whatever how you put it and so I

192
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:08,470
had an old legacy short path a two liter

193
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:09,850
and a five liter okay we were doing

194
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,430
small-scale production of cannabis

195
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,170
essential oils as soon as I arrived at

196
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:15,549
jetty we were doing cannabis essential

197
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:18,610
oils just want to make that clear

198
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:21,969
because when I walked in I didn't have

199
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:24,730
these plant or I profiles to smell as an

200
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:28,330
example of what cannabis tasted like in

201
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:31,480
a vape pen I had the real McCoy and so

202
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,470
what after I dried that you know you

203
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,450
know it was revealed to me there were

204
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,820
plant profiles and so on and I tried

205
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:39,070
that and I was like Oh yuck Oh yuck this

206
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,680
won't do but I don't want to knock it

207
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,120
some people liked it but in the early

208
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,149
days of our cannabis essential oil

209
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,909
production we had small similar off

210
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:50,620
flavors in every batch okay so we were

211
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:53,019
using a technique that I'll get into in

212
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,539
a second but there was a problem in

213
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,189
Denmark there and one of the things

214
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:59,500
about jetty that that I'm gonna

215
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,600
emphasize in this talk is we don't stand

216
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,940
still we always critique what we're

217
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,500
doing we always try to be better we

218
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,660
don't look at the competition we look at

219
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,399
what we are doing okay because these

220
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:11,139
guys who founded the jetty they loved

221
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,259
the plant I love the way the plant

222
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:17,830
smells I loved vaping okay I love this

223
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:20,649
company and so we put so much love in

224
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,900
our products that we actually talk about

225
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:24,970
this will actually sit and talk about

226
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:27,458
intentionality and this is you know

227
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,910
something my before I met my lovely wife

228
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:31,069
that I'd really never heard about it

229
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:33,199
engine allottee it was my intention to

230
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,540
get to my molecule the quickness that I

231
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,090
could so when you know this whole

232
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:39,649
concept of intentionality it sort of

233
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:42,080
brought me to this community and this

234
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:43,879
whole idea of plant-based medicine so

235
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,480
enough asides I will do a lot of them

236
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:51,950
let's move on to the next slide here so

237
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,990
where are we now we're prop 64 compliant

238
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,090
hydrocarbon is our main method of

239
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:59,450
extraction with UX and capabilities we

240
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:02,930
have precision grinding instead of just

241
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:05,870
the cold room we also have a minus 60

242
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:09,439
cryo freezer we're no longer doing any

243
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,179
scrubbing we have large capacity

244
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,060
stainless steel filtration we only need

245
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:15,949
large Road of apps we have a VTA which

246
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:18,679
is a very nice continuous white film

247
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,270
system you can do in two passes just

248
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:24,679
like the Pope at a lot higher capacity

249
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:27,309
we in February we acquired an HP 1hp two

250
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,719
hot condensing short path and

251
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:31,609
distillation device and it's amazing

252
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,590
people I don't know if anyone's use this

253
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:36,440
or seen this on at breaking dabs website

254
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,750
but it's a game changer and now thank

255
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,870
God it's my R&amp;D piece and I got to

256
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:44,120
retire the old 5 liter Summit bastard

257
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:47,120
you know we'll talk about how fast that

258
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,560
one was but you know what it's you know

259
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,940
you always got to love your you know the

260
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,179
first thing you trained on but this

261
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:55,610
thing's a Cadillac now and you know with

262
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:57,199
with work we just we devise scaleable

263
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,019
production of cannabis essential oils

264
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,650
and we eliminated the off flavors okay

265
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:05,750
so you may see me stop and take a sniff

266
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:15,169
of these if I'm feeling like a little

267
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:20,269
woozy something like that later we can

268
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:22,279
talk about it but one of the things I

269
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:24,439
love about my job is I get to walk into

270
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:26,480
a place where I have a fridge full of

271
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:30,400
cannabis drive terpenes somehow no

272
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,399
matter my mood there's something for it

273
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:42,740
okay so we're just started talking about

274
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,740
prop 64 there's one thing we got to

275
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:48,019
really talk about a prop 64 which is

276
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,370
probably my biggest contribution to

277
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:52,879
jetty I would say in the machines

278
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,320
Department okay and that is analytical

279
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,528
testing okay

280
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,180
there's two types of analytical testing

281
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:02,328
that I've kept broadly categorized in

282
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:05,689
the cannabis industry and one's accuracy

283
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:07,309
so cannabinoid potency and also terpene

284
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,130
testing if you want to put terpenes on

285
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:12,768
your label in California you gotta have

286
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:15,409
them tested you all know this within I

287
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:17,889
believe it's 10% of the printed value on

288
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:22,360
your package or you fail compliance and

289
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:25,189
that's as you all know a very bad thing

290
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,220
safety as well so I have on the right

291
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:30,380
the it's not the 62 it's the 58

292
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:34,430
pesticides that can be tested by HPLC

293
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:37,490
there's 62 and of these there's category

294
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:38,958
2 and category 1 does anybody know the

295
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,919
difference between category 1 and

296
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:46,338
category 2 I do if you even see category

297
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:48,799
1 on your data you're done fails

298
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:50,870
compliance mainly this is because these

299
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,319
pesticides that have been used in the

300
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,089
cannabis industry before are not

301
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,860
designated as safe pesticides by the

302
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:59,750
state of California to be used on food

303
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:03,199
production so that's where that came

304
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:05,028
from so below is a little nice ninety

305
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,149
seven point one three percent total

306
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:10,159
cannabinoids that's one of our nice oils

307
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:13,159
there so that's an idea of sort of the

308
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:16,610
potency testing so along with safety we

309
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:17,899
have residual solvents okay and so back

310
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,919
in the day and I'll talk about this

311
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,198
there was sort of a different category

312
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:23,860
for residuals but now they compromise

313
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:29,448
solvents that are deleterious to human

314
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:33,050
or that's the right word are bad for

315
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:35,149
humans to inhale okay or eat we also

316
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:37,819
have mycotoxins so these are toxins

317
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:40,309
produced by microorganisms that are

318
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,390
dangerous to human health we really

319
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:43,219
don't have a problem with these in

320
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,328
distillate and then of course heavy

321
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,330
metals cat3

322
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:51,769
you have on the next slide

323
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:54,080
we've got arsenic a clm a CL me that's a

324
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:56,360
little MRI thing the ACL people tear it

325
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,490
so our snick cadmium lead and mercury

326
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,740
okay we've got to keep those two parts

327
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,389
per billion levels so what do I talk

328
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,028
about this about Jani well we're ahead

329
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:07,850
of the curve even before I got there

330
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:10,578
before they were even asked to do this

331
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:13,040
JD was doing potency and pesticide

332
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:14,328
testing and the records go all the way

333
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,069
back they're kind of fun to look at

334
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:20,389
steep hill was the only game in town

335
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:22,879
that's what we used in July 2016 started

336
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:25,100
with CW did terpene testing and also

337
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,528
residual solvents and here's the thing

338
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,450
about residual solvents it was less than

339
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:33,169
5,000 parts per million of flammable

340
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,700
solvents okay flammable solvents which

341
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:37,129
is funny because ethanol is really

342
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,540
flammable too and although it's not

343
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:40,639
great to inhale it's not going to kill

344
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:43,699
you or give you cancer like chloroform

345
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,458
dichloromethane no dichloroethane so

346
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:49,759
these really gnarly chlorinated solvents

347
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:52,009
so you know by the grace of the chemists

348
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,769
who worked with the BCC whatnot we got a

349
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:56,539
new list of residual solvents include

350
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:58,850
the chlorinated solvents and also

351
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:02,149
benzene xylenes things like that

352
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,589
although those are flammable so let's

353
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:04,909
talk about the heavy metals because I

354
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:08,240
don't think the industry was ready for

355
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:11,269
this are you guys ready for cat 3 right

356
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,060
cat 3 hit hit everybody like a kick in

357
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:16,250
the pants the reason is is the equipment

358
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:19,639
that the labs needed to study cat 3

359
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,259
isn't done ducted coupled plasma ok it's

360
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,350
an expensive technology it's very

361
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:27,730
accurate the old technology atomic

362
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:31,639
absorption wasn't quantitative enough so

363
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:35,120
who even had an ICP who even had the

364
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:37,458
working capital to spend 150 grand 200

365
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,129
grand and figure it out and have a

366
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:42,649
chemist figure it out how to do it ok

367
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:44,419
these guys as you know these guys and

368
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:49,159
gals in the testing labs they're backed

369
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:52,159
up you know a week sometimes so you've

370
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:55,399
got to pull somebody off to get that ICP

371
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:57,198
running ok so when I came to jetty we

372
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:00,559
have all these things that are mandated

373
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:08,809
and we've got to figure out what

374
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:11,328
is going to be our response okay so the

375
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:12,619
two pictures on the right the top one

376
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:16,129
that looks like something out of Star

377
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:19,009
Wars is a triple quad hplc mass spec

378
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,170
mass spec and it's used for those 58

379
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:23,539
pesticides the other four I didn't

380
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:26,209
mention you need a gas chromatograph on

381
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:28,309
the bottom there is the HPLC uv-vis that

382
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,500
I would have been able to afford so you

383
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:34,639
know you just dial it in and pumps it's

384
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:36,170
great so in-house analytics so that was

385
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,850
the first thing I was asked to evaluate

386
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:41,630
we went around and we looked at stuff

387
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:45,859
and the HPLC uv-vis was the standard for

388
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:47,390
potency okay it still is and we were you

389
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:50,149
know interested in that but it was about

390
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,370
40 or 50 grand to get in that and don't

391
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,440
know if you know the SHPO sees a limit

392
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:57,319
ography technique so now we've got to

393
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,640
have organic solvents and we've got to

394
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:00,049
have a place to deal with organic

395
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,980
solvents we didn't have fume hoods at

396
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:07,399
the time so we decided against that one

397
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:09,259
next option triple quad and a GCMs like

398
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,710
I said there's four pesticides you can't

399
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:16,579
do with the triple quad so that was

400
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:18,140
about 300k used plus as you heard

401
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:20,119
earlier I'm not an analytical chemist

402
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,470
I'm an organic chemist I'm a

403
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:25,039
jack-of-all-trades

404
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:27,230
that's my Instagram name so you know I

405
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,829
told the guys you know if we're gonna go

406
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,380
for this

407
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:32,720
you know HPLC triple quad I'm gonna need

408
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,120
some training you know I'm gonna need

409
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,940
some training and it's gonna be a lot of

410
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:40,909
my time on this thing and I want a

411
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,009
service plan etc etc so the numbers

412
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,420
started rising and we just kind of

413
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:48,230
decided you know that's not really what

414
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,759
we need to do for just one category so

415
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,500
in there at the bottom I'll mention it

416
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,750
was the ICP you got to put that there as

417
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:57,049
a joke because it really can't do

418
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,970
anything else for us but heavy metals so

419
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:02,950
the middle thing is what we settled on

420
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:06,920
the GC fi D because it can do pote

421
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:09,679
potency of the neutral cannabinoids THC

422
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,840
and then to do tht a and all the other

423
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,798
acid cannabinoids you have to do

424
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,480
something called derivatives a ssin

425
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:19,158
but I believe there still is to this day

426
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:26,909
a testing lab in California that uses GC

427
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:28,799
to do its pesticide testing ok GCMs you

428
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:32,399
can take a GCF ID it's flame ionization

429
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,808
detector vaporized particles hit or they

430
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:36,778
hit a flame and they're counted by

431
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:39,239
basically a detector counts ionized

432
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:42,599
particles were really good at measuring

433
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:44,548
small electrical signals and so that's

434
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,998
how that works forms a peak every time a

435
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:49,798
substance comes out of the machine Union

436
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:51,118
I can go into this a little bit more at

437
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:53,970
the end of people who really want to go

438
00:19:51,118 --> 00:19:55,769
into these techniques but we could add

439
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,769
residual solvents and we could add

440
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:59,999
terpene profiles just by slapping

441
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:01,710
something on the end of the machine

442
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:04,200
there was only about 10 15 thousand

443
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,899
dollars and I would probably beg for a

444
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,139
service plan but you know it's better

445
00:20:06,898 --> 00:20:13,709
than the 300 400 thousand dollars okay

446
00:20:10,138 --> 00:20:15,269
so the best return on investment

447
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,590
remember what I said jetty we're all

448
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:20,548
about running lean we're all about

449
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:23,009
intentionality and so I would have loved

450
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:25,679
to have all those instruments absolutely

451
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:30,269
loved out my own lab like that and have

452
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:32,309
jetty pay for it we scientists we love

453
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:37,019
to have toys y'all and we love to have

454
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:39,928
you all pay for it so what we decided on

455
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:42,058
was a GC flame ionization detector so we

456
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:45,600
got a quick potency method for oil from

457
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:47,638
res Tech and in four minutes four

458
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,288
minutes I had my answer and in fact it

459
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:51,358
two and a half minutes I had my answer

460
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:55,950
because pretty much all the cannabinoids

461
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:57,569
that wanted you know would aleut we're

462
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,009
done after two and a half minutes I

463
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:00,450
don't know if anybody knows about thin

464
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:02,249
layer chromatography the old-school

465
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,109
method you have these little plates we

466
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:06,358
use them to monitor reactions and purity

467
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:08,339
will they take about you know two and a

468
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:12,868
half minutes to run GC I can actually

469
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:15,868
get percentages and ratios and man I'm

470
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:19,558
telling you you know I almost never ran

471
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:21,628
TLC again but GC went down for a little

472
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:23,278
bit so we had to do that but anyway so I

473
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:24,868
really liked it because now we could we

474
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:26,919
had a machine that could do really

475
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:28,808
quickly potency

476
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,249
testing we could monitor monitor our

477
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:33,999
distillation 'z we could monitor

478
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:36,069
incoming material you know just sort of

479
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:40,659
things yet everybody has to know like

480
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:43,388
how it was just insane to me that people

481
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:45,519
were producing distillates with all

482
00:21:43,388 --> 00:21:48,178
these procedures and didn't have their

483
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:51,339
own analytics it was just like what

484
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:53,259
yeah man looks good bra looks it's

485
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:55,720
yellow yeah look at that it's good bra

486
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:57,220
well little did I know I mean you can

487
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,710
actually do a lot with a visual

488
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,909
inspection and chemists have been for

489
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,069
hundreds of years have been doing that

490
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:04,749
but I come from a fancy little graduate

491
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:08,878
school and we have all our machines that

492
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:11,350
you all paid for so useful reactions

493
00:22:08,878 --> 00:22:13,839
involving basic cannabinoids so

494
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:19,108
everybody now is on to these these minor

495
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:22,808
cannabinoids right THC V cbn right dt8

496
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:26,319
teach the acetate THC hemi succinate

497
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:28,118
hexa hydro THC well guess what if I want

498
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,538
to go into the lab and make these things

499
00:22:28,118 --> 00:22:34,358
I can actually watch my reactions

500
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:36,069
proceed and decide that if I have my

501
00:22:34,358 --> 00:22:38,528
head up my butt or actually found

502
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:41,980
something really really quickly so we

503
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:44,409
wanted that capability and we were also

504
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,419
be able to do terpene profiles it's easy

505
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:48,539
to operate no solvent and then of course

506
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:54,220
the upgrade that I talked about

507
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:56,349
okay so GC succeeds where HPLC fails

508
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,450
alright this is an interesting story

509
00:22:56,349 --> 00:23:00,668
that I want to kind of tie in a little

510
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,489
bit later we're gonna come back to it at

511
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:06,399
the end I probably want to bite into QC

512
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:07,659
a little bit to talk about this but you

513
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:09,398
know you're we're to talk about

514
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:11,320
production innovations and this is a

515
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:13,268
little bit of science okay

516
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:18,608
so we're gonna go ahead and skip past

517
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:20,378
that let's get past the data and we're

518
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:23,138
gonna talk about go back into my outline

519
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:25,528
biomass is the first step so we found

520
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:28,118
biomass preparation necessary for co2

521
00:23:25,528 --> 00:23:31,269
everybody knows that you can't just take

522
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:35,408
you know a mallet and start jamming the

523
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:38,470
co2 thing full of full of a biomass it's

524
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:40,480
not efficient and if anyone knows who

525
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,420
Marcus Rogan is

526
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,269
at the time I met him he was outcault he

527
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:50,558
actually optimized particle size and a

528
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:53,440
number of other concerns with co2 and

529
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:56,558
his co2 oil it looked amazing

530
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,160
so anyway back to when I back off my

531
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:02,500
tangent we used ninja blenders actually

532
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,610
you know I would say Nate did they went

533
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,048
out they told me they'd go up to

534
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,119
Humboldt County with a bunch of ninja

535
00:24:05,048 --> 00:24:09,579
blenders and they would hack that crap

536
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,609
out and everybody's going what blenders

537
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:13,928
are you you know and they you know what

538
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:16,449
the really funny thing and this is what

539
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:18,519
dials back to Marcus Rogan is guess what

540
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:23,529
grind is best for cannabis terpenes and

541
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:24,839
co2 the freaking ninja blender the ninja

542
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:28,149
blender

543
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:30,308
that's a tidbit from Marcus's talk okay

544
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,410
when we moved to ethanol we found that

545
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:34,569
that grinding was unnecessary this was

546
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:38,769
the early days and we were getting a lot

547
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:40,839
of chlorophyll from a biomass okay so we

548
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:45,429
really needed no advancement in grinding

549
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:47,949
technology co2 or the when we got into

550
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:50,710
hydrocarbons we had to ditch that a

551
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:54,250
ninja neo farms told us ditch that ninja

552
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,620
we've got you bro it's uh it's it does

553
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:58,359
this stuff really fast you know and it

554
00:24:56,619 --> 00:25:00,639
beats the ninja blender and it kind of

555
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:03,369
looks like it looks like a snow making

556
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,770
machine to me and much like a snow

557
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:09,428
machine making machine it love to blow

558
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:12,308
Keef all over the room okay many of you

559
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:15,190
probably used this one so we had no dust

560
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:17,048
control and I would not go near that

561
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:19,808
room when that thing was running just

562
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:22,240
allergies like crazy so we had no

563
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:23,950
control of particle size we had no speed

564
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,160
control and there was like I said a

565
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,808
heckuva loss of mechanical material so

566
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,200
at that same conference where I met

567
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:33,899
Marcus Rogan he introduced me to a

568
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,298
company called I believe it's called

569
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:41,679
fridge okay that make these Cadillac

570
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:43,629
hammer mill grinders okay so it's not

571
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,630
like it's amazingly new tech it's just

572
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:49,750
kind of new to cannabis but those things

573
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:52,690
being a Cadillac are a lot of money so

574
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,680
we did our usual jetty research and we

575
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,808
we kind of

576
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,400
got in you know in the room and Spock

577
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:59,500
was asked what he thought about the

578
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:02,200
grinding and I mentioned that I'd seen

579
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,690
this hammer mill tack and then our

580
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,630
lab manager Kurt went out and he just he

581
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:10,620
just scoured the earth for an affordable

582
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:16,690
solution so that's how we got it to the

583
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:20,379
the hammer mill technology and let's get

584
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:22,720
to the picture of this so this is our

585
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,420
key Froome and this is our fancy grinder

586
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,860
now we have positional blades we have

587
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,460
air assist if we need it because Keith

588
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:33,669
gets sticky we got sieve screens we can

589
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:36,340
control particle size and boy howdy look

590
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:40,150
at those numbers 45 minutes before to

591
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:42,939
process not precision process 50 pounds

592
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:45,519
get that hammer mill running 10 pounds

593
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,549
in 50 minutes or having 50 pounds in 10

594
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,349
minutes see a lot of stuff backwards

595
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:54,700
okay so this really really kicked it up

596
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:56,109
a notch extraction okay this is kind of

597
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,670
the big thing that I really don't feel

598
00:26:56,109 --> 00:27:00,219
like I need to talk to about a ton

599
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:03,039
because everybody is super passionate

600
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,900
about the way they do things but you

601
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,480
know a jetty we do a lot of stuff by

602
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,280
trial and error small scale and at the

603
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,069
time there was just some disadvantages

604
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:16,450
to these these these other techniques

605
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:19,089
that we had the main the main message

606
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:21,539
here is throughput in regulation co2

607
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:22,720
couldn't do the throughput we needed and

608
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:27,940
ethanol

609
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:30,819
while it was good if we wanted to scale

610
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:34,179
it up which we did we were growing we

611
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:35,529
had to change our chemical manufacturing

612
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:39,040
status because we needed more than a

613
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:41,019
thousand gallons in process so what we

614
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,000
had was we had one of these little

615
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:45,970
waters guys that's actually a pretty big

616
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,670
water sky we had a single tube and then

617
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:51,220
we got the Delta Co P and that's what we

618
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:55,690
used and when you you know they helped

619
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,980
we were we were cranking out oil one

620
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,600
last thing I'd like to say about the

621
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,058
ethanol is she was filtration and

622
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:03,849
bottlenecks everybody knows solvent

623
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:05,619
recovery is crazy and also if you I

624
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,119
don't know about the cryo technique but

625
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:09,609
when we were doing it the

626
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:12,759
article size this stuff would coagulate

627
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:15,519
like crazy these fats and waxes and so

628
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:17,200
we had to you know it was a bottleneck I

629
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,289
mean you'd be scraping it's we tried all

630
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,120
kinds of different iterations so it was

631
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:26,139
nice when we finally got the hydrocarbon

632
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:29,889
and we were able to see a much more easy

633
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:33,880
to deal with process so the decision to

634
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:37,509
do hydrocarbon summer 2017 to 2019 was a

635
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,760
decision driven by regulation we got our

636
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:42,879
type seven license and so we're ready to

637
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:45,308
go and before we went a little crazy we

638
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,030
got ourselves a little bit busy bee and

639
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:51,099
I'm not sure we even it owned it and we

640
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:53,500
just started doing what we do we started

641
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:55,899
doing experiments and and it's like I

642
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,390
said it's what we found that the

643
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,370
processing post-processing went to

644
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,140
almost nothing you know there's all

645
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:03,428
kinds of post-processing that everybody

646
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,380
knows about here and I'm not going to

647
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:07,769
belabor the point it's all on future

648
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:13,330
4200 and that's where I learned it all

649
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:15,579
but for us speed okay the more you can

650
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:18,250
do with the less labor is more efficient

651
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:19,779
you're faster to market and you know

652
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:22,630
that's really important to us we're

653
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:25,808
growing so we decided that we would go

654
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:27,370
with hydro carbon deliberately okay when

655
00:29:25,808 --> 00:29:30,009
I first got into this I was like well

656
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:31,659
hydrocarbons really bad and then I was

657
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:33,220
introduced to the process and I realized

658
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,320
the only thing left in these extracts is

659
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,870
ethanol from winterization and anybody

660
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:39,669
who win arises or uses ethanol is gonna

661
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:43,599
potentially have ethanol in their final

662
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:46,480
material so that faded so we got Betsy

663
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:50,139
up there in the corner I don't know who

664
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,910
named her but she's a workhorse and we

665
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,100
did this because at the time ethanol

666
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:56,920
distillate can only do ethanol could

667
00:29:54,099 --> 00:30:00,519
only do distillate and we wanted to

668
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:02,500
branch out we you know these guys these

669
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:05,139
guys have been doing this since 2013

670
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,789
nan-oh and dispensary we knew about the

671
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,980
variety of products that were out there

672
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:12,099
the diamond technology was just starting

673
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:14,519
to come on these cookies has anyone ever

674
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:17,349
seen cookies these little cookie things

675
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,519
okay we brought on a guy named Tran and

676
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:20,679
he is

677
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:24,579
butane artiste he loves making pictures

678
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:26,230
and stuff with butane so don't do like I

679
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:27,149
did and assume they're Nilla wafers in

680
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:31,900
the break room

681
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:34,810
don't do it thank God the metabolism of

682
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,490
THC a right is very very slow in your

683
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:39,339
body and it's not deep carved yet or I

684
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:40,960
would not be here talking to you they're

685
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:45,480
not Nilla wafers but they are delicious

686
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,480
and we'll be releasing them fairly soon

687
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:53,529
the c1 d1 room and I guess I should talk

688
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:56,500
about this a little bit with jetty we

689
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:59,460
literally doubled in size when we were

690
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,750
getting our hydrocarbon in our intake

691
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,730
apparatus ready because we knew

692
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,579
hydrocarbon was going to kick ass and do

693
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:08,470
a lot of trim so we acquired there was a

694
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:11,049
whole nother company here when I started

695
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:14,049
we acquired that side and we were able

696
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:16,029
to expand so we actually have two c1 d1

697
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:19,990
rooms and one of them we use for

698
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:21,910
pesticides and filtration so quickly

699
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,200
let's talk about winterization not going

700
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,690
to belabor the point used to use a

701
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:29,049
walk-in freezer got this sweet-ass cryo

702
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:31,990
freezer - 60 48 hours goes down to four

703
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:34,599
hours and with the the hydrocarbon

704
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,180
precipitates the fats and waxes it's a

705
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:39,339
lot easier to deal with

706
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,810
okay so here's like I said thousand

707
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:43,089
monkeys or the thousand typewriters

708
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:46,809
mentality so these 15 mil Buechner

709
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:49,359
funnels they're really great and you can

710
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:52,179
you know take that amount of activated

711
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:55,209
carbon which we needed and you needed

712
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,500
about 500 but it looked like an organ so

713
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,809
it was pretty awesome and if you believe

714
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,660
that I have a bridge to sell you

715
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:04,210
we had much larger ones 2000 now here is

716
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:07,420
what we ended up buying this stainless

717
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:10,539
steel filter skid table or stainless

718
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:13,360
steel stainless steel filter table with

719
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:15,579
basically on a skid and eventually the

720
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:17,769
idea is you know as everyone's done and

721
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:20,109
Heisenberg's done you basically you want

722
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:22,509
to go to manufacturing that's simply

723
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:25,539
never sees any buckets or anything it's

724
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:26,890
all in line okay so this piece of

725
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:30,519
equipment will eventually be able to

726
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:31,900
integrate into this type of thing so the

727
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,779
great thing about this is we went from

728
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,850
40 kilograms a day or I'm sorry 6

729
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:39,910
kilograms a day with that nasty goopy

730
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:42,219
stuff to 45 kilograms a day and we're

731
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:44,320
still under capacity like if anybody

732
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,890
needs to filter in the Bay Area I'm sure

733
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:50,379
we can tell a process Nate that will

734
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:53,860
total process your filtration so we did

735
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:55,900
this with half the labor and if anybody

736
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:59,429
wants to know it's an infinity

737
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,430
manufacturing concepts okay

738
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,970
concentration okay I'm accused of not

739
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,799
having a lot of concentration sometimes

740
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:11,019
but concentration simply solve it

741
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,879
removal and you've got our first little

742
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:15,250
guy up there in the top a bukey rotovap

743
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,990
2 liter and then you've got the 20

744
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,910
liters and then the road of apps are

745
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,700
retired

746
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:23,380
okay there are D road of apps now you

747
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,509
know put colored liquids in them

748
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,990
whatever but anyway so we started out

749
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:31,029
with it the 2015 with the 2-liter and

750
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:36,039
then 2016 when we moved to ethanol as

751
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:38,319
you guys as you all know the capacity

752
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:38,740
that you need to do solver rules just

753
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:43,529
crazy

754
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:46,750
so 2017 to 2019 when we move to

755
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:49,899
hydrocarbons we were able to drop back 2

756
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:51,369
to 20 liters but we also needed 5 to

757
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,280
litre Road of apps that we already had

758
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:56,769
to do the final processing to get it

759
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:58,420
ready for the D carb okay and so that

760
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:59,589
whole boot that workflow was based on

761
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:04,750
the D car workflow

762
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:06,279
okay April 2019 is when we initiated the

763
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,349
new D carb which is what I'll talk about

764
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:11,739
next we retired the little road of apps

765
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:15,759
ok and we're doing an average of 4

766
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:18,039
liters per hour of solvent removal ok ok

767
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,070
I know I'm looking at the time I tend to

768
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:24,849
ramble so let's try to pick it up 2016

769
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:27,039
2019 for the dank ages we're talking

770
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:29,648
about atmospheric D carb this is a

771
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,750
picture of how VTA told us how to deke

772
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:35,079
arm they said put it on a hot plate and

773
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:37,809
stir it for 8 hours ok

774
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:40,449
and that's fine though it works it

775
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:42,190
actually works really well ok but it

776
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:43,898
just kind of gives off a lot of volatile

777
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,220
zuv a lot of dank but it does work

778
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:49,210
really well

779
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:51,638
and we wanted to do it a little bit more

780
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,990
efficiently because the reason it's on

781
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,970
there for eight hours and we knew this

782
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:56,348
is when you're doing manual d car but

783
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:58,929
only took about an hour for the bubbles

784
00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:01,720
to stop why the heck are we doing this

785
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:04,649
for eight hours well it's those volatile

786
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:07,329
x' and just let me kind of divide up

787
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:09,430
cannabis if I if I you know I will just

788
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:12,279
since abroad categories so for

789
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:14,829
distillation so we have basically we're

790
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,910
gonna have an insoluble amount of stuff

791
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:18,848
that we're gonna remove in winterization

792
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:20,259
or we're not going to extract then we

793
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:22,119
have the first set of volatile as

794
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,760
cannabis drive terpenes essential oils

795
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:27,340
the next the next half or what I call

796
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,540
the volatiles and those are all the way

797
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,880
up to the boiling point of the

798
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:33,070
cannabinoids what we really want and

799
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,380
then afterwards you have what everyone

800
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:38,500
calls I think calls for 10-day its the

801
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:43,059
goop okay so we have to get rid of that

802
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:46,780
those care those volatiles above the

803
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:49,269
cannabis derived essential oils a lot of

804
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,710
them we did do quite a good Terp runs so

805
00:35:49,269 --> 00:35:53,079
some of the higher volatile is right

806
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:55,690
before the distillation point of the

807
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:57,489
cannabinoids okay we could we could

808
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:00,280
strip those out but the lower volatile

809
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:03,399
would really mess up the white film so

810
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:06,010
we had to get rid of them but you know

811
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,690
being a chemist and having been cut my

812
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:09,730
teeth on short path distillation I

813
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,980
decided that we could do this under

814
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:14,559
vacuum oh and I know people were doing

815
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,199
this way before we were but as jetty

816
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:20,079
goes I had to prove concept I can't just

817
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:23,230
walk in and be like Al this is a logical

818
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,598
this is just illogical no I had to show

819
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:29,139
him it worked I just show him it worked

820
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,059
took me about on and off three or four

821
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:33,219
months messing around with systems and

822
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:35,529
then I finally got a system that retired

823
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:37,439
I wrote of apps and made a 24-hour

824
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,970
process into eight hours and

825
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,849
unfortunately the delicious tangi smell

826
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:44,919
was gone

827
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:49,539
okay so distillation this is one of the

828
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:52,570
large largest capital investments okay

829
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:55,500
I didn't even get to the dank ages so

830
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:58,780
this is what I was talking about

831
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:01,630
okay so distillation the largest capital

832
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,220
investment decision time we decided to

833
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,650
go with white film instead of short path

834
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:10,929
because basically it was just easier

835
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:13,690
short path takes skill and I learned no

836
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:16,089
more mimosa ever learned about the

837
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:18,490
skillet took was from this man breaking

838
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:20,860
dabs over there because I really thought

839
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:22,809
I had gotten short path you know I'd

840
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,610
made this beautiful water clear oil and

841
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:27,039
and you know I thought it'd be and I got

842
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:31,900
this down you know I can do one liter in

843
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:33,300
seven hours this is cookin and yeah so

844
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:37,150
[Music]

845
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:40,120
anyway so we decided to go with the Pope

846
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:42,400
its produces actually a pretty nice oil

847
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:44,650
you can do two passes or you have to do

848
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,139
two passes and the picture over there

849
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:49,630
czar is an example of it that's probably

850
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:51,190
a six-inch Pope actually but you know

851
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:54,280
the distillate comes out on one side of

852
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:57,010
a tent eight on the other and you do

853
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,900
your two passes or its chirps and so

854
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:01,810
then we decided to add another pope and

855
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:04,269
we added the four-inch pope and although

856
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:06,610
we were able to load more this is kind

857
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:11,280
of a funny contradiction there was no

858
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:13,599
change in speed okay we didn't have

859
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,600
continuous white film distillation

860
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,509
system and so we had to have operators

861
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:22,630
loaded unloaded so we went to one of the

862
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:25,660
you know really famous consulting firms

863
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:28,710
to get an auto feeder well in those days

864
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:31,659
I want to say the tech wasn't ideal and

865
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,980
unfortunately the dream of running the

866
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:35,469
thing overnight and continued his

867
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,880
extraction failed so that's when we

868
00:38:35,469 --> 00:38:40,329
started looking at these continuous

869
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,240
extraction white film and I just want to

870
00:38:40,329 --> 00:38:46,719
say that I guessed wrong i I I just got

871
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:49,029
to put this out there I I've been on the

872
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,189
wrong pony and they override admit I'm

873
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:53,170
glad they did so we decided to go with

874
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,639
the VTA instead of an American brand

875
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,650
that I really loved and I've heard a lot

876
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:59,170
of bad things about since then but

877
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,700
anyway this is a really passionate topic

878
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,220
so I'm not going to go into it

879
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:06,069
we got route Sciences German engineering

880
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:08,709
once we can do thick and with all they

881
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:12,760
can what is that Sivan

882
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:14,858
no finesse okay that's our model we can

883
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,720
do 8 liters a day we could probably push

884
00:39:14,858 --> 00:39:18,969
this and break it and that's what 2

885
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:22,299
passes so we have a better color

886
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:23,828
distillate and we're consistently I put

887
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,539
it in the 90s but you know what it

888
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:28,420
honestly depends on the biomass team

889
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:30,190
that we're getting and at least always

890
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,559
at you know in that in the middle high

891
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:35,710
eighties and so this is a beautiful jar

892
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:38,859
the oil there and this is our I don't

893
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:41,500
even know lab manager Jones and that's

894
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:44,409
our beautiful root science right there

895
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:49,269
so it's amazing you load the material

896
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:52,088
here and all under vacuum for the wiper

897
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:53,619
and then the oil just comes out here so

898
00:39:52,088 --> 00:39:56,019
it's pretty cool technology and I know

899
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:58,329
there's a lot better stuff but right now

900
00:39:56,019 --> 00:40:00,009
a jetty it's working for us and we will

901
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:02,619
make the investment in the next step of

902
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:05,890
technology when we go to that continuous

903
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:07,900
flow through process that I was talking

904
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:09,159
about and so right now you know we're

905
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,680
kind of looking at that and how we're

906
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:13,539
gonna do it so I've been sneaking a

907
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:16,088
recorder and a camera into highs in

908
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:19,858
Bayer manufacturing and you know just

909
00:40:16,088 --> 00:40:24,699
click click how do you do this click

910
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:26,650
okay so let's see where I'm at and this

911
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:32,169
talk Travis I got a time check 10

912
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:34,210
minutes can I do I'm sorry so I really

913
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,309
wanted to talk about this a lot because

914
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:39,269
this is this is one of my favorite

915
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:42,160
things to do this is my research

916
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:44,108
instrument and this is was the biggest

917
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,269
breakthrough in short path as far as I'm

918
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:49,509
concerned it was called wide bore and

919
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:52,298
hot condensation and he developed it in

920
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:54,220
2016 I really can't go through this

921
00:40:52,298 --> 00:40:55,539
slide as as much as I'd like but it's

922
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:59,879
gonna you're gonna have it available to

923
00:40:55,539 --> 00:41:02,949
you a long story short we bought one and

924
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:06,460
there's me with the system and that

925
00:41:02,949 --> 00:41:09,639
allowed us access to d9 water-clear dat

926
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:12,519
TV and now I'm doing 2 litres in 5 hours

927
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:15,480
ok and that start to finish with D

928
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:19,449
carbon the pot I can do a second pass in

929
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:22,070
two to three hours so this thing rocks

930
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:25,119
so that takes down the resident time

931
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,120
which is really important okay

932
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:29,719
so really quickly let's talk about

933
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:32,960
cannabis drive terpenes so this is my

934
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:34,939
thing and I want you to call them CEOs

935
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,110
cannabis essential oils because they're

936
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,940
more than just terpenes

937
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:41,059
there's hundreds of turpenoid and non

938
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:46,400
typing compounds available in the

939
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:48,590
volatile portion of this plant and one

940
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,410
of them is no no no it's not non anal

941
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:53,630
get your heads out of the gutter and

942
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:56,869
it's flat so I got a floral and orgy

943
00:41:53,630 --> 00:42:01,550
smell and it is in no way a terpene it's

944
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:04,250
an aldehyde c9 unit okay but actually

945
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:05,840
it's one of the highest contributors to

946
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,789
the odor of cannabis if you take

947
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:11,059
cannabis and put it in a duffel bag for

948
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:13,039
68 hours known and Alan you sample the

949
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:14,840
headspace around it known and Al is

950
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,469
actually one of the strongest scents and

951
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:20,420
we were training the dogs to do

952
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:22,489
carolien oxide okay so where were we at

953
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,349
jetty we were doing steam still steam

954
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:25,939
still is what everybody's doing doing

955
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:29,449
the Rd then we bought a big one looks

956
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:33,470
like this water goes in here biomass in

957
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:36,829
there heat the steam comes on out the

958
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:38,209
steam cools and then is caught in here

959
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:40,400
the terpenes will float on top to

960
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:41,840
cannabis oils float on top and then you

961
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,550
can separate them okay

962
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:52,550
so what you're doing a hundred pounds a

963
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:53,900
day pretty good okay I want to show you

964
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:56,060
really quickly the difference between a

965
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:59,750
profile and a cannabis derives essential

966
00:42:56,059 --> 00:43:03,610
oil it's in the grass is what I said so

967
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:08,210
this is a profile of granddaddy purp and

968
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:10,099
probably see about 20 beats maybe this

969
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:13,369
is a cannabis essential oil of an OG

970
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:16,099
Kush and my GC isn't even that great

971
00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:18,109
it's not even that great and look at

972
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:20,239
alphap I mean this is this is on my

973
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:22,519
method so I can only sample boiling

974
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,709
points around here in a headspace I can

975
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:27,800
go more alphap I mean there's compounds

976
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:29,420
in front of it okay and we know roughly

977
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,910
what these compounds are we know that

978
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:33,170
there's about 400 of them so if somebody

979
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,769
wants to finance me they start getting

980
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:36,119
some standards that

981
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:38,250
I would appreciate it and we'll start

982
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:40,589
figuring out exactly what this is or

983
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,760
we'll farm it out okay so the next

984
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:43,140
iteration now that you know what

985
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,360
cannabis essentials oils are and how

986
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:47,429
complicated they are is to do it under

987
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:50,370
with a vacuum assist so you can do at a

988
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:53,429
lower temperature well this was better

989
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:55,589
ish when I smelled student steam so

990
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:57,659
loyal it was it really all smelled the

991
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:00,390
same to me and it had a burnt caramel

992
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:02,489
and a grassy smell and then we got to

993
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:04,349
atmospheric and the smells were still

994
00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:05,939
there and I so hated them that that I

995
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:07,949
would just be super picky about it be

996
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:12,510
like this is just not acceptable this is

997
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:14,399
just no and by the way I studied in

998
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:17,910
France so I'm not trying to insult the

999
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,130
French people I love them so it also

1000
00:44:17,909 --> 00:44:22,440
took days to dry okay that was a big

1001
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:25,440
thing we had have a drying room we turns

1002
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,409
brown snarly you can't go in there

1003
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,389
without a mask you know it's it takes

1004
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:32,549
too long and we still have those off

1005
00:44:30,389 --> 00:44:34,230
flavors so I just went in the lab and

1006
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:36,030
like I said we always try to do better

1007
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:39,329
and better and better and through Marc

1008
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:41,670
ones remark for I finally was able to

1009
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:43,349
prove to Jetty we love the essential

1010
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,420
oils we were making but we're only

1011
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:48,170
making them on small scale so I was able

1012
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:51,630
to prove to jetty that we could do this

1013
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:54,269
finally we got to the mark for the the

1014
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:56,369
real the real kicker for us was when we

1015
00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:59,429
did a water-clear skywalker OG Penn and

1016
00:44:56,369 --> 00:45:03,480
Noah and Travis tasted this among others

1017
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:06,869
and they were like whoa whoa yeah and we

1018
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:09,000
were like whoa whoa and when I said no

1019
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:11,369
about accidental medicine is we actually

1020
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,489
gave these pens to you know all over the

1021
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:16,230
convention and I had a patient or a

1022
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:18,779
person write me back and said this is

1023
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:21,539
the best d8 water-clear I have ever had

1024
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:25,110
for pain and I wrote him back and I said

1025
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:26,670
it's not d8 it's t9 and he was like well

1026
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:29,490
I don't know why I've tried every d9

1027
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:33,240
product and get my hands on and so we

1028
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:34,559
were like crap must be the Terps we're

1029
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:36,539
not sure but it's something we'd like to

1030
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,130
study anyway so it's been implemented

1031
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:40,590
chedi we're making cannabis drive

1032
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:43,079
turbines at scale and we can get broad

1033
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:44,940
profiles we can we can control the

1034
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:47,190
profile if we want the drying room is

1035
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,760
gone and the mark 5 is in development

1036
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:54,778
and probably

1037
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:56,400
hi okay so it's happening this is this

1038
00:45:54,778 --> 00:45:58,559
is the year of cannabis essential oils

1039
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,329
this year or next or next year folks

1040
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,420
that's my prediction

1041
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:04,829
other methods you can look at these we

1042
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,430
looked at them didn't like them

1043
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:09,450
microwave and then I call Pangaea attack

1044
00:46:07,429 --> 00:46:10,440
just go ahead and go through that that's

1045
00:46:09,449 --> 00:46:15,000
from biomass

1046
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:19,230
yeah Pangaea was a IC mag so woot-woot

1047
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
open sourcing okay IC g IC mag he or she

1048
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:24,088
I don't really I never even really met

1049
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,940
Pangaea designed a system you can go on

1050
00:46:24,088 --> 00:46:28,710
and you can google it and it's actually

1051
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,858
makes really nice water clear good

1052
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:34,380
smelling kind of essential oils okay now

1053
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:37,048
here's the Mina potatoes of the actual

1054
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:40,349
events we have a timeline from 2018 to

1055
00:46:37,048 --> 00:46:42,318
May 2019 and here shows what happened

1056
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:45,329
with the implementation of these

1057
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:49,170
technologies so when we got to hydro

1058
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:51,359
carbon we increased our production 50 to

1059
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:54,059
100 percent and our capacity increased

1060
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:57,659
hundred percent the VTA the cryo freezer

1061
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:59,339
we got in August 818 same time and I'd

1062
00:46:57,659 --> 00:47:01,949
like you to understand the numbers are

1063
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:03,929
kind of melded together but when you go

1064
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:06,838
from 48 hours to four days

1065
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:09,179
that helps the VTA four hundred seventy

1066
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:12,328
percent increase in production capacity

1067
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:13,759
up eight hundred percent filter table 13

1068
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:20,490
percent increase in production in

1069
00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:23,068
January 19 and then we excuse me the

1070
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:25,949
capacity increased 750 percent in half

1071
00:47:23,068 --> 00:47:30,028
the labor category three screwed us over

1072
00:47:25,949 --> 00:47:32,788
I think everyone over output dropped our

1073
00:47:30,028 --> 00:47:35,690
input in so production dropped and that

1074
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:38,369
meant input also dropped okay

1075
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:40,650
significant events as well the mark 4

1076
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:42,450
came online and we all right we were

1077
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:45,450
able to access these essential oils in

1078
00:47:42,449 --> 00:47:48,058
our products I don't know if anyone's

1079
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:51,449
noticed a difference I hope you have and

1080
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:54,089
3:19 we we instituted the SPD tech we

1081
00:47:51,449 --> 00:47:56,699
were able to do jetty reserve okay it

1082
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:58,889
actually has a 4% increase in production

1083
00:47:56,699 --> 00:48:01,348
of these specialty products and if we

1084
00:47:58,889 --> 00:48:02,618
max this thing out we could get 12 D

1085
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:06,249
carb P volatile is a

1086
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:09,999
another 12% er and the thing about that

1087
00:48:06,248 --> 00:48:12,189
is 24 process our process goes to 8

1088
00:48:09,998 --> 00:48:14,139
hours and we no longer need this large D

1089
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:16,298
car barrier we no longer need the the

1090
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:19,179
road of apps we've got a lot of space to

1091
00:48:16,298 --> 00:48:22,210
expand ok this is great

1092
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:24,190
our D space I wish so over this period

1093
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:26,548
over this 15 month period we had a

1094
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:29,650
tenfold increase in the amount of

1095
00:48:26,548 --> 00:48:33,400
material we were able to bring in so the

1096
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:35,380
technology just fed exactly you could if

1097
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,509
I had the line here I didn't want to put

1098
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,880
it but it's basically follows this trend

1099
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:41,409
exactly and now we're kind of in a

1100
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,210
little bit of a period where things are

1101
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:45,338
kind of cuckoo and we can talk about

1102
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:48,728
that later if you want

1103
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:51,849
in summary I just wanted to say that you

1104
00:48:48,728 --> 00:48:55,149
know just Geddy's ahead of ahead of the

1105
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:57,609
curve usually we work together we do

1106
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:59,200
things intentionally and if you get

1107
00:48:57,608 --> 00:49:00,608
anything about of my talk it's something

1108
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:03,659
you already knew that extraction and

1109
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:07,328
distillation methods determine capacity

1110
00:49:03,659 --> 00:49:10,449
we run lean the largest acquisition that

1111
00:49:07,329 --> 00:49:12,099
I made was a 35 K short path everything

1112
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:14,489
else I did the Terps that he carved

1113
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:18,999
everything else that was done under

1114
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:21,880
$10,000 the GC was done around 20k okay

1115
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:25,718
so our commitment to cannabis essential

1116
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:29,440
oil has upped our game we have great

1117
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:31,509
capabilities to I mean this is this is

1118
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,829
just it's just the tip of the iceberg

1119
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:34,838
just making them as the tip of the

1120
00:49:32,829 --> 00:49:39,789
iceberg folks if you have the tech to

1121
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:42,130
make them you can do so much ok and that

1122
00:49:39,789 --> 00:49:44,349
the last but not least sort of my deal

1123
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:46,960
is that manufacturers with their own

1124
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:50,289
analytical even if it's just a GCF ID

1125
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,789
are more agile okay do I have time to

1126
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:54,009
talk to a little Tucker a little bit

1127
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:56,880
about the story about about the d-10 why

1128
00:49:54,009 --> 00:50:03,630
this famous more agile okay

1129
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:06,700
so first let's go talk about that okay

1130
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:12,548
so does anybody here know what Delta 10

1131
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:16,058
th she is okay good okay this is Delta

1132
00:50:12,548 --> 00:50:18,400
10 th see I've got there's no chiral PI

1133
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:20,559
indicated here this is just a general

1134
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,599
structure the double-bond has moved from

1135
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,709
this position to this position different

1136
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:26,709
molecule different shape different

1137
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:29,828
activity on the top there is a molecule

1138
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:33,938
called D 6 ad 10a okay

1139
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:38,619
it's another cousin of cannabis so let's

1140
00:50:33,938 --> 00:50:42,188
talk about this story here so well I'm

1141
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:43,689
clicking back well we were short passing

1142
00:50:42,188 --> 00:50:46,149
in these old five leaders and two

1143
00:50:43,688 --> 00:50:48,909
leaders with long residency time we were

1144
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:51,278
getting what we noticed low potency oil

1145
00:50:48,909 --> 00:50:53,048
and we couldn't figure out why because

1146
00:50:51,278 --> 00:50:55,989
more passes is more better the color got

1147
00:50:53,048 --> 00:50:58,900
better what's going on here well hope we

1148
00:50:55,989 --> 00:51:02,199
have a GC you guys so we could actually

1149
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:03,579
see what was going on and what we were

1150
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:05,499
finding is that there are these two

1151
00:51:03,579 --> 00:51:08,339
peaks and that's about the

1152
00:51:05,498 --> 00:51:10,298
sophistication I had with the GC there

1153
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:12,248
because we didn't have standards for

1154
00:51:10,298 --> 00:51:13,630
those compounds we knew they fell in the

1155
00:51:12,248 --> 00:51:16,838
cannabinoid range so we weren't really

1156
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:18,640
super worried but you know this was

1157
00:51:16,838 --> 00:51:22,509
lowering our potency and we couldn't

1158
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:26,650
have that so here is a product that we

1159
00:51:22,509 --> 00:51:29,139
had one of our orange anis products with

1160
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:31,599
these two peaks so if you can see you've

1161
00:51:29,139 --> 00:51:35,618
got CBD and then there's question mark

1162
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:37,059
d-10 d-10 a 6a THC the reason that I can

1163
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:39,640
actually put those question marks there

1164
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:42,189
is because I thought it was an isomer of

1165
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:44,259
THC I wasn't sure if was d-10 or any of

1166
00:51:42,188 --> 00:51:47,678
the other things I didn't know well

1167
00:51:44,259 --> 00:51:51,150
lucky for me I met Noah cook and he gave

1168
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:56,108
me he's like here here's some d-10 what

1169
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:59,019
yeah d-10 might be your mister EP and we

1170
00:51:56,108 --> 00:52:00,818
took that sample back to the lab and it

1171
00:51:59,018 --> 00:52:03,879
was 80% pure and thank God it was

1172
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:05,949
because I got two peaks he just given me

1173
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,539
a hundred percent pure delta10 that

1174
00:52:05,949 --> 00:52:10,568
would end this story which gets a little

1175
00:52:07,539 --> 00:52:12,519
more complicated but so we had it so we

1176
00:52:10,568 --> 00:52:15,400
went and we took some material that had

1177
00:52:12,518 --> 00:52:17,768
these Peaks in it and we spiked it a

1178
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,289
little bit of d-10 and lo and behold we

1179
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:22,389
saw those Peaks rise no new peaks we

1180
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:24,249
knew that we had Delta 10 and it was

1181
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:26,650
lowering our potency well these these

1182
00:52:24,248 --> 00:52:28,699
people went even further they figured

1183
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:34,010
out the potency loss was due

1184
00:52:28,699 --> 00:52:35,929
in part to high retire high residency

1185
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:37,910
times in short pass but also because

1186
00:52:35,929 --> 00:52:40,129
there was fast check out there that crap

1187
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:42,858
they sprayed all over California during

1188
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:45,349
the wildfires and y'all probably got

1189
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:47,949
some cheap trim right so but when you

1190
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:51,140
process this trim you ended up getting

1191
00:52:47,949 --> 00:52:53,358
oil then had these breakdown Pete's this

1192
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:55,038
is what the oil should look like so it

1193
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:58,098
wasn't in everything okay

1194
00:52:55,039 --> 00:53:00,650
so we had the GC and now I can monitor

1195
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:04,278
for this peak I know now when I'm doing

1196
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:06,858
crap short path okay I know it's t10 and

1197
00:53:04,278 --> 00:53:09,559
now I know that I can monitor all of our

1198
00:53:06,858 --> 00:53:12,500
processes and see if d-10 is happening

1199
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:14,599
and be like hold the presses everyone so

1200
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,579
that's how agile we are so we we don't

1201
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:18,140
have to take in bad material there's

1202
00:53:16,579 --> 00:53:21,010
tests for ammonium phosphate and

1203
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:24,139
ammonium sulfate stuff like that now

1204
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:27,680
before I want to end with this really

1205
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:30,078
quickly so the d-10 story gets a little

1206
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:31,909
more interesting what about that second

1207
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:35,509
peak okay everyone was talking about

1208
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:38,298
d-10 d-10 do ten Yatta Yatta and I was

1209
00:53:35,509 --> 00:53:40,699
like on futures 4200 I like which

1210
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:43,190
diastereomer which enantiomer and they

1211
00:53:40,699 --> 00:53:45,858
were like what what are you talking

1212
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:47,809
about well molecules have shapes and

1213
00:53:45,858 --> 00:53:50,298
even though they have the same exact

1214
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:52,700
chemical structure and bonds there's

1215
00:53:50,298 --> 00:53:55,809
something called handedness like they're

1216
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:57,889
like mirror images some of them okay and

1217
00:53:55,809 --> 00:54:00,130
they don't have the same shape they

1218
00:53:57,889 --> 00:54:02,838
don't have the activity and actually

1219
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:07,970
there are four potential compounds for

1220
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:09,380
d-10 so I thought well you know these

1221
00:54:07,969 --> 00:54:12,318
that other peak is probably an

1222
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:15,108
enantiomer or a dynasty remember diester

1223
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:16,460
say enantiomer diastereomers because

1224
00:54:15,108 --> 00:54:18,949
they have different boiling points and

1225
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:22,009
here are two diastereomers at mesh well

1226
00:54:18,949 --> 00:54:24,018
I'm at out made in 1984 it's all out

1227
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:25,250
there sometimes we just don't know where

1228
00:54:24,018 --> 00:54:28,909
to look for things because it's in the

1229
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:30,199
scientific literature okay so I did a

1230
00:54:28,909 --> 00:54:32,420
little bit of an experiment

1231
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:34,098
I read the literature and I found out

1232
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:36,289
that there's a difference in boiling

1233
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:39,500
point or melting point by a hundred

1234
00:54:36,289 --> 00:54:41,020
degrees on these things and like well

1235
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:43,630
guess what

1236
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:44,679
it's not a diastereomer Wyeth because

1237
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:47,230
they would show up completely

1238
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:49,449
differently on the GC so I've said okay

1239
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:52,269
we got one of these guys what's that

1240
00:54:49,449 --> 00:54:54,189
next peak read the literature and you

1241
00:54:52,269 --> 00:54:58,139
see that if you heat them like crazy

1242
00:54:54,190 --> 00:55:03,400
they go to d6 ad 10a it was known in

1243
00:54:58,139 --> 00:55:05,829
1984 right and I had this paper and it

1244
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,410
was only until we got an NMR of this

1245
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:11,529
material that we had a little bit of a

1246
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:13,210
clue and also I want to share with you

1247
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:16,510
this experiment that actually clued me

1248
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:18,460
on as well so I had some low potency

1249
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:20,619
short path oil and we have all this crap

1250
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:22,539
sitting around and I wanted to fix it so

1251
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:24,820
I thought hey let's just throw some t41

1252
00:55:22,539 --> 00:55:27,099
clay in there it's a city let's turn it

1253
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:30,280
all into d8 let's watch what happens

1254
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:32,559
folks two hours into the reaction Delta

1255
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:34,360
nine actually does start going down you

1256
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,230
see a reduction in the d-10 peak and

1257
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:41,140
then this new peak starts rising up and

1258
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:43,360
so I'm like well this sucks because

1259
00:55:41,139 --> 00:55:47,739
that's actually where the other shoulder

1260
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:49,510
lines up to so da eight and that they

1261
00:55:47,739 --> 00:55:51,429
might be on top of each other I don't

1262
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:53,170
know what's going on three hours of

1263
00:55:51,429 --> 00:55:56,349
reaction is pretty much finished D nines

1264
00:55:53,170 --> 00:56:00,070
almost gone and then look at the D 10

1265
00:55:56,349 --> 00:56:02,739
ratio almost completely gone okay so I

1266
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:05,289
was like got it

1267
00:56:02,739 --> 00:56:07,989
d 10 you're out I've gotten on I've got

1268
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:10,809
a way to create Delta 8

1269
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:13,739
I've got Delta 8 right from junk and

1270
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:15,969
people are interested in this well I

1271
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:18,309
send it out for lab testing and

1272
00:56:15,969 --> 00:56:19,959
unfortunately and this ties into the

1273
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:24,099
other story ygc was better

1274
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:26,679
I got a result back that said it was D

1275
00:56:24,099 --> 00:56:29,500
10 plus CPC as everybody knows that

1276
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:32,019
Peaks bs the cbiit there's no CBC and a

1277
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:35,559
lot of your low potency oils it's Delta

1278
00:56:32,019 --> 00:56:38,769
10 but guess what folks it ain't just

1279
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:42,219
Delta 10 and that's me going out on a

1280
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:45,159
limb okay so what we learned the result

1281
00:56:42,219 --> 00:56:48,459
I got back D 10 plus you know I go

1282
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:51,429
thought I got rid of it was 30% okay and

1283
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,990
if you go back and you look at you go

1284
00:56:51,429 --> 00:56:54,730
back and look at the starting material

1285
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:58,689
the ratio of these suckers was

1286
00:56:54,730 --> 00:57:01,119
about 30% okay so nothing changed there

1287
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:03,070
and I was really bummed and I kind of

1288
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,858
set this aside and then an NMR came up

1289
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:08,559
and on the NMR there was a small side

1290
00:57:05,858 --> 00:57:11,349
product this was very pure stuff it was

1291
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:13,090
Noah's stuff and on the NMR there's

1292
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:14,679
these two little Peaks out in a region

1293
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:17,740
where US chemists really know what's

1294
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:20,289
going on easy to see from everything

1295
00:57:17,739 --> 00:57:24,639
else and actually what it turns out is

1296
00:57:20,289 --> 00:57:26,800
there these Peaks right here so they

1297
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:28,809
match up perfectly with Delta six a

1298
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:31,869
delta 10a okay

1299
00:57:28,809 --> 00:57:33,940
guess what I haven't proved shit okay I

1300
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:35,950
haven't proved anything I've got a I've

1301
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:38,530
got a hypothesis what do I need to do I

1302
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:42,299
need a pure standard of Delta 10a I need

1303
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:45,070
an NMR of this I need a GC of this and

1304
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,930
what a fine mess we've walked into folks

1305
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:50,890
because all these potency labs

1306
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:53,259
they've got HPLC UV vis as their their

1307
00:57:50,889 --> 00:57:56,949
method to do potency on your stuff guess

1308
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:59,680
what d6 a and D 10 a may be sitting

1309
00:57:56,949 --> 00:58:02,108
under the same peak in their method so

1310
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:04,690
they can't tell you the difference so

1311
00:58:02,108 --> 00:58:07,440
they can now say oh well it's d-10 a d6

1312
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:09,550
a 10 a and 10 yada yada and

1313
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,460
diastereomers and actually when this

1314
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:15,190
product is formed it's actually not just

1315
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:18,220
one compound it's two it's the right

1316
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:20,530
hand in the left hand of d6 8na it's a

1317
00:58:18,219 --> 00:58:23,409
racemic so boy we've got cannabinoid

1318
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:25,359
soup so I really hope that they can

1319
00:58:23,409 --> 00:58:27,250
figure out a way to redo their method so

1320
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:31,090
they can see this stuff and top stop

1321
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:33,099
telling everyone at CBC and if not well

1322
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:35,170
I've got a GC method to sell them

1323
00:58:33,099 --> 00:58:38,289
I mean rats deck does sorry about that

1324
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:41,108
okay so let's let's finish off with

1325
00:58:38,289 --> 00:58:44,650
acknowledgments I'm just gonna brush

1326
00:58:41,108 --> 00:58:47,529
over this really quick thank you all for

1327
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:52,900
your patience god I talk forever

1328
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:56,560
so basically here's who made it all

1329
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:59,019
possible and if these guys Nate Rob Ron

1330
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:02,049
and Matt hadn't been here I wouldn't be

1331
00:58:59,019 --> 00:59:05,079
up here Kurt didn't offer up there

1332
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:08,380
because like I said I'm Spock well Kurt

1333
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:11,828
is oftentimes Scotty and

1334
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:14,829
check off and hora and everything else

1335
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:17,349
including the captain sometimes and he

1336
00:59:14,829 --> 00:59:19,239
just does amazing things so I made my

1337
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:21,759
make my scientific recommendation we

1338
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:22,960
look into stuff and then as a team we

1339
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:26,309
decide what we implement

1340
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:29,769
okay so just here is a production team

1341
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:31,989
Lindsey of course shelter project and

1342
00:59:29,768 --> 00:59:33,219
then over here is everybody else that I

1343
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:36,460
just would like to specifically mention

1344
00:59:33,219 --> 00:59:38,588
and just a tie-in to our last proposal

1345
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:40,900
you guys I wouldn't know anything about

1346
00:59:38,588 --> 00:59:43,568
cannabis as quickly as I did without

1347
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:45,999
open sourcing and I'm gonna put this out

1348
00:59:43,568 --> 00:59:49,538
there and this is another reveal I am

1349
00:59:45,998 --> 00:59:52,149
going to put my new terpene technology

1350
00:59:49,539 --> 00:59:54,940
not Jetty's technology open source as

1351
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:57,039
soon as I figure out how to scale so

1352
00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:03,278
y'all can hear yeah I'm gonna put it out

1353
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:06,729
there I literally could not control

1354
01:00:03,278 --> 01:00:08,440
enough biomass in my dreams to make the

1355
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,759
amount of cannabis drive terpenes that

1356
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:13,088
people are going to want to use for

1357
01:00:09,759 --> 01:00:17,289
medicine and recreation so that's my

1358
01:00:13,088 --> 01:00:20,108
promise to you guys there's my email you

1359
01:00:17,289 --> 01:00:23,710
can follow us on IG at jetty extracts I

1360
01:00:20,108 --> 01:00:25,568
am at dr. Jack Hughes and it's been a

1361
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:27,759
pleasure speaking to you guys and I'm

1362
01:00:25,568 --> 01:00:28,900
sorry I went over give it up for dr.

1363
01:00:27,759 --> 01:00:32,639
