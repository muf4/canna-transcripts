00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:13,348
[Music]

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,649
so the science started in conventional

3
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:23,100
agriculture with Elaine dr. Laningham

4
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:25,439
and conventional agriculture is a is a

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,939
thing and it's not interested in those

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,528
technologies techniques and there's a

7
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,829
massive effort to keep them out of that

8
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:33,750
area so kind of the cool thing is where

9
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:35,549
they're being really embraced and picked

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,659
up is within the cannabis industry and

11
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:39,659
these are the people that are living

12
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:41,218
inside a forest so I feel like what we

13
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:44,429
do is a form of ecological restoration

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,840
if I can if I can fix your farm the

15
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:46,439
forest will fix itself from inside

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,160
you're fine

17
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:57,718
and so the intense production model of

18
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:59,878
the states of like Nevada they went big

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,650
with warehouses in this heavy production

20
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:06,629
model and so their analysis of that

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,100
process was a very quick learning curve

22
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:10,109
and each week you're bringing new

23
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:11,759
batches of plants and on you know a

24
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:13,260
200,000 square foot building there's a

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,390
lot of learning to have right there and

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,640
the same things happening in light depth

27
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:22,680
I can go and help a corn farmer and turn

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,299
around one season and learn a specific

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,070
set of information from that interaction

30
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,200
and then I can go to a light depth

31
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:30,269
greenhouse and I can have five full

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,490
harvests in a calendar year so for every

33
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:35,158
year I get 5 full opportunities to learn

34
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:36,959
and that is propelling the cannabis

35
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,049
light depth and high production indoor

36
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,728
people I mean decades and decades and

37
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,579
decades ahead of the commercial

38
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:46,170
agriculture and so I think the long-term

39
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:48,179
implications that are really hopeful

40
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,490
because we're going to hit a point where

41
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,320
the average age of the farmer that's

42
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:53,908
growing our food is 62 retires their

43
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,609
kids are now lawyers because farming is

44
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,368
not a Prospera business and the mega

45
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:01,530
scale and we're gonna have a tremendous

46
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:04,078
amount of really educated talented

47
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,090
farmers that know more responsible ways

48
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,589
to produce food and they've been working

49
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,520
with altering environments I think

50
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,250
that's gonna be needed for human

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,930
survivability so that's kind of what I'm

52
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,878
all about I'm trying to help those

53
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,129
people and try to help that movement

54
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,289
people take what I say really personally

55
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:21,209
but I'm I'm here for human survivability

56
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:23,009
and the way I'm doing that is by

57
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,080
communicating what's happening in the

58
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,189
soil to cannabis farmers and that's a

59
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,080
really enjoyable thing to do with my

60
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:30,269
life I believe the question is about

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,209
integrating food production and cannabis

62
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:35,300
production into the regulated market the

63
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,620
reason why that question is asked is

64
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,500
there seems to be the farther you get

65
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,599
away from suburban America or integrated

66
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,699
heavily densely populated growing areas

67
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:48,119
you start to end up with organic living

68
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,829
soil sustainable practice farmers that

69
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,150
are growing their food along with their

70
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,349
cannabis and I think it came out of a

71
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,330
need because these are the same people

72
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:56,459
that don't want to live off food from

73
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,019
the center store and so they're trying

74
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,519
to grow their own food so naturally just

75
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,739
they threw it in with the beds of

76
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,259
cannabis and that turned into making

77
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,689
really good food and also turns out

78
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:07,859
farther you get off the road and the

79
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:10,199
more vegetables are grown with the

80
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,800
cannabis the bigger the plants get the

81
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:16,199
reason why that happens is in a living

82
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,719
soil system the nutrients are produced

83
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:22,289
by organism to organism interactions

84
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,900
those organisms are fed through plant

85
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:27,019
root relationships so the more roots you

86
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,789
can get into that living soil the more

87
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,230
surface area you have for the potential

88
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:33,209
producing nutrients and that's exactly

89
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:36,329
what happens and that was a really fun

90
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,400
transition for me like started out going

91
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,870
to you know the chemical farmers in the

92
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,150
mountains and the better I got at the

93
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,920
microscope the farther I got off the

94
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,670
road and the more food was being grown

95
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:51,000
with plants you have there is so many

96
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:52,829
there's so many specifics about no wood

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,180
there's you know certain growing

98
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,620
materials you can use there's certain

99
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,300
things inside and it's outside of the

100
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,830
building

101
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:03,330
so we don't I don't think an approach to

102
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,240
surviving the regulated era would we

103
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,490
grow food in with the plant just because

104
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,439
the complications but we can take that

105
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,570
learning lesson into the regulated area

106
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,729
and we can replace the food with cover

107
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:18,689
crops that host micro as a fungi we can

108
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:20,399
we can grow plants that host these banks

109
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:23,160
of populations of organisms that produce

110
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,069
nutrients in the soil so we still carry

111
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,310
that mentality in that method for

112
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:33,509
success but the regulate s it's a sticky

113
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:36,509
thing and but we've we've had a wide

114
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:38,189
array of root vegetables that grow the

115
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,180
brassicas are helpful in starting the

116
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:40,800
system because they're early

117
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,389
successional plants they become

118
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,819
antagonistic earlier on but they are

119
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,560
good for starting a system and so we've

120
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:49,019
had cover crop blends that have root

121
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,850
vegetables in it and all kinds of wild

122
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,579
things so you still you still can carry

123
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,950
the method for success but it might be

124
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:57,599
really complicated there are a lot of

125
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:59,430
people that are entering the regulated

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,060
market with brands and they also grow

127
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:06,449
food so whether those happen at the same

128
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,730
exact location I don't know that would

129
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:11,610
be risky I think just because now you're

130
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:14,520
combining two regulatory bodies so I

131
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,400
probably keep them separate if we can

132
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:18,990
move out of fear of problem mindset and

133
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,399
we can move away from being afraid of

134
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,110
things we can quantify them

135
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:27,239
mathematically and address them with a

136
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,000
cost-effective approach and that just

137
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,009
takes a mentality shift of the facility

138
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,449
but people are absolutely succeeding in

139
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:35,519
the regulated market they're absolutely

140
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:37,649
thriving in the regulated market doing

141
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,310
living soils the beneficial insects and

142
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:44,709
no chemicals in the building

143
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:46,329
and that would be my suggestion for a

144
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:48,039
reasonable pathway through the regulated

145
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:49,469
market remove all the things that can

146
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,540
cause a fail and create plant health

147
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,180
environments that lower pest pressure

148
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,379
and disease susceptibility and then they

149
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,150
can get you in trouble for any things

150
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:01,600
what the industry really needs right now

151
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:02,979
is help with best practices there's a

152
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,629
couple groups that are trying to do it

153
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:10,540
the TCC the ICF a not up on all of them

154
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:12,759
but the farmers are communicating to me

155
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,620
that that what's really needed from them

156
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,930
is a way to actually differentiate

157
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,840
themselves from the other growers I mean

158
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,300
we're in an era where organic facilities

159
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,489
in regulated States or using banned

160
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,680
pesticides really on and skate and under

161
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,019
it's absurd

162
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,129
disrespect yeah man that's an absurd

163
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:32,129
disrespect for human life

164
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,990
[Music]

165
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,120
that's absurd to me because we can

166
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,680
quantify mitigate and adjust for these

167
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,649
pests we don't need to poison humans in

168
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,600
the process and it's you know the

169
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:47,829
process is raising an intelligence I

170
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,439
think our farmers need to raise an

171
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:53,289
intelligence and that's kind of been

172
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:55,509
what I've been after mostly inspired by

173
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,760
like the Dragonfly Medicine people and

174
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:59,469
they said something to the effect of we

175
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,819
don't need any more rich people we need

176
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,889
educated farmers that can farm

177
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:05,500
sustainably so humans can survive

178
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,960
that's really I think the beauty of the

179
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:11,019
regulated era as we bring things to the

180
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:12,489
forefront and as we examine that examine

181
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:15,848
them closely it shows how much we're

182
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:18,250
relying on a by all means approach with

183
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:19,959
disregard to human health you know and I

184
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,370
think it's really irresponsible to our

185
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:23,318
fellow people and if you're a farmer

186
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,908
growing something that's consuming you

187
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,750
have the highest obligation to other

188
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:27,750
humans to act right

189
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:47,428
