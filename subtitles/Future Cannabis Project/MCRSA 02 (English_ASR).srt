1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,160
with with um with that said I would like

2
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,600
to open it up to uh two two two

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,960
questions right

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,760
now are you relying on counties to

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,118
require an e are you just establishing

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,118
an ER to begin with are you doing a

7
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:32,320
master e or program e or individual IRS

8
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:34,320
per uh cultivation area can you go can

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
you expand on that sure yeah I'm happy

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,600
to talk about that that's a really good

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,120
question so um so the department of food

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,280
nag is preparing a programmatic eir

13
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,878
that's looking at the potential impacts

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,679
of the licensing program across the

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:51,359
entire State um and so uh by nature of

16
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,000
that that it's a Statewide environmental

17
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,238
impact report it is not going into a

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,439
gory amount of detail for individuals

19
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,280
cultivation sites or individual

20
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,119
locations it's just beyond the the scope

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,400
of what the state can accomplish one of

22
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,079
the real challenges uh for the sequin

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,280
analysis for the environmental impact

24
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,640
report is that uh when you do an

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,400
environmental analysis what you're

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,319
supposed to establish is the Baseline

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,920
what's happening today and then what

28
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,599
what's going to change as a result of

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,239
the licensing program and what the

30
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,519
impacts of that increment of change

31
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,118
might cause well one of the things we

32
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,000
don't have is a lot of good information

33
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,799
on what exactly is happening today I

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,920
mean we understand how people grow

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,799
cannabis but we don't know where exactly

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,680
everybody is how large their operations

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,200
are how long they've been doing it uh

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,799
what the specifics of how they in

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,960
particular so Baseline conditions very

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,759
difficult to establish uh and then the

41
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,118
increment of change how many people are

42
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,718
going to come under this licensing

43
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,680
program at what size are these existing

44
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:48,679
operations are they new operations so uh

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,640
Department of food and nag has

46
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,719
circulated some surveys trying to gather

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,519
that type of information and better

48
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:56,839
understand um what level of uh of

49
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,478
interest there is in the program how

50
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,359
many licenses are going to come online

51
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,840
so that those are some of the kind of uh

52
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,519
uh methodology challenges but getting

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,799
back to your question about local

54
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,758
requirements the state is definitely

55
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,080
looking to local government to address

56
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:15,119
issues that are most important uh for

57
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,840
the local communities and similar to a

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,120
state's rights issue the state is uh

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,759
looking at that zoning and land use type

60
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,360
of decisions those are decisions that

61
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,560
are made in City and County General

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,200
plans that's really within the purview

63
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,000
of local agencies to comply with a local

64
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,839
noise standard that would be something

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,560
also that would a local government would

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,200
establish and so when uh when an

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,560
applicant comes forward to the state um

68
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,158
and they make application uh the state's

69
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,719
going to be interested to see the squa

70
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:45,079
document that was done the environmental

71
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,680
impact report or whatever it might be uh

72
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,280
that was done for either the County

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,560
ordinance or that specific grow site and

74
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,598
they're going to have to independently

75
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,800
verify that all of the environmental

76
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,719
impacts between the state ydir that they

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,439
did and whatever the local government

78
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,719
did covers it now if it doesn't

79
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,919
um then there may be a need for the

80
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,719
Department of food and agriculture to do

81
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,798
an additional more detailed study or

82
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:11,280
perhaps push back on the on the counties

83
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,920
and cities they have not made a

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,239
determination as how to exactly to

85
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:18,079
handle

86
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,158
that uh there's the full range from

87
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,480
notice my from what I've heard local

88
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,840
governments have gone from everywhere

89
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,679
from a notice of exemption uh all the

90
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,360
way up to a full-blown e and you know

91
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,599
another thing for the Statewide e we we

92
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,519
understand that there's a number of

93
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:34,238
counties and cities throughout the state

94
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,039
that have outright banned cannabis

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,840
cultivation all fors of can all sorts of

96
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:40,598
cannabis Commerce um our fundamental

97
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,519
assumption is that that may change at

98
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:44,318
any time and we are not going to be

99
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,599
assuming that just because Fresno County

100
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,878
has a band in place today that ban will

101
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:49,119
be in place three years from now so

102
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:50,919
we're really trying to create

103
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,280
environmental analysis and a regulatory

104
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,119
program that's going to be durable in

105
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,000
the light of all the changing

106
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,599
regulations and laws and ordinances that

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,158
are

108
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:03,759
passed um in my in my misspent youth um

109
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,878
I was an assistant deputy mayor for

110
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:09,519
Richard Reon um and I was a Democrat

111
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:12,199
Republican my job was a planning Deputy

112
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:17,759
for him and in that role was to look at

113
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:20,199
er squa and ways to make businesses um

114
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,840
make squel less onerous on business more

115
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,840
important to try to achieve certainty so

116
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,519
when you go into the process you know

117
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,198
when you're going to come out and you'll

118
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,959
know what you need to do one the local

119
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:36,879
Authority has uh opined that you're

120
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:40,000
you're good and ready to go um when I

121
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,279
talk to a and the rest um of the other

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,639
governmental agencies I tell them that

123
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:47,159
let's not keep piling restrictions on

124
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,280
top of restrictions on top of

125
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,439
restrictions because we're trying to

126
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,478
figure out every type of problem that

127
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:58,319
could occur instead let's think of ways

128
00:04:55,478 --> 00:05:00,680
that we can protect the community but

129
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:05,000
also ensure that that businesses are

130
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:08,160
able to know what it will take to

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,839
actually open that door and I think for

132
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,400
most of you if not all of you um that's

133
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:16,519
what you want you're not trying to get

134
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:19,478
around eirs or neg decks or any of that

135
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:23,038
you just don't want to get trapped in

136
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:26,519
some kind of spiral out of control e

137
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:29,199
that last 10 years or 20 years and so I

138
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:32,359
I plan to personally work with all the

139
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,400
enti ities involved to ensure that um

140
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,919
maybe for the first time we can come up

141
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:39,399
with some type of certainty on on IRS

142
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:41,038
and other things right and and just to

143
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:42,638
build off that because I think that's an

144
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,199
a really good point is is just the

145
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,439
endless cycle um the way the law is set

146
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,879
up is that the state standards are the

147
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,439
minimum standards local governments can

148
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,478
establish standards that are more

149
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,120
stringent but not less and so in theory

150
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,359
by the time you've come forward to the

151
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,478
state you already have met the basic

152
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,080
minimum standards through complying with

153
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,800
the local requirements which have to at

154
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,000
least match the states now that said

155
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,120
there's a little bit of a chicken or the

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,959
egg thing because many local governments

157
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,759
want to have people ready to go with

158
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,598
their approvals on January 1st 2018 yet

159
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,560
the state won have adopted regulations

160
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:16,918
yet so there the local governments don't

161
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,319
even know what the state requirements

162
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,799
are going to be um there is a first

163
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,840
draft of the regulations it's going to

164
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,439
be circulated early next year and

165
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,478
there's going to be three more rounds of

166
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,038
public review so it's our hope that

167
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:29,478
through that process people will have a

168
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:30,839
pretty good idea and can start to get

169
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:31,680
ready for what the state requirements

170
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,560
will

171
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,598
be obviously the banking issue is a huge

172
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,680
issue it's going to be a major issue for

173
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:41,598
the State of California so when will we

174
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,079
see action in Congress oh no there is

175
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:46,240
there's movement all along the front

176
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:52,279
along a wide front now compared to what

177
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:55,478
it was uh four five years ago and uh we

178
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,439
I would expect that there to be some

179
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:59,478
major

180
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:03,038
Improvement at least lay the found

181
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:06,240
foundation for this industry's financial

182
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:10,279
uh status sometime within the next two

183
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,720
years uh and that is let me just note

184
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,239
that is if the

185
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,520
Administration has a positive approach

186
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,038
to it and we don't know exactly what

187
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,198
Donald Trump's approach will be but let

188
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:25,680
me just make the Republican argument on

189
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,919
this and that is I have personally been

190
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:33,319
deeply disappointed in what so many

191
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:35,399
democ rat uh uh office holders and and

192
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,479
people with authority now that they

193
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:41,279
could do something uh have stepped back

194
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,878
including our own Attorney General of

195
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,679
the United States Attorney General's

196
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:50,960
office uh I end up look I wrote Into the

197
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,560
law I know I wrote the law that says it

198
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:58,079
is that the federal government is not

199
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:00,158
cannot spend any dollars any resources

200
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,918
on over uh on

201
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:07,038
overriding a state that has agreed to

202
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:10,158
make the medical use of marijuana uh

203
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:12,959
legal and how many times ignoring that

204
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:15,759
do we see the DEA and people from the

205
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:19,638
justice department going in and

206
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,280
attacking people in medical marijuana

207
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,720
operations and of course stealing their

208
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:28,439
property uh through you know

209
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,280
confiscation and and it's stealing I

210
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,838
don't care what to say that this is a uh

211
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:37,598
asset forfeiture is nothing more than

212
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,680
than theft of the worst kind and we need

213
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,640
to make sure that anyway to answer your

214
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,559
question uh I believe now and I hope

215
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,919
again this isn't

216
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,399
just you can't just say the Democrats

217
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,559
are liberals so they're going to they're

218
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:54,839
going to be on board and help us they

219
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:58,479
haven't been okay and I've had to write

220
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,760
judges I've had to threaten the Attorney

221
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,560
General the United States this is

222
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:06,120
illegal for you to do because I wrote

223
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:08,599
the law and a law passed and was signed

224
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:15,600
into the law I think that we are going

225
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:18,879
to see some major reform if indeed uh my

226
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,440
my Republican colleagues can look at the

227
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,439
marijuana business as they should it is

228
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,279
a

229
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,600
business and there is nothing more in

230
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,120
more some people have hurt themselves on

231
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,800
marijuana we know that you know some

232
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,879
people have just uh smoke themselves

233
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:39,759
into outside of a job you know Etc but

234
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,919
compare that to alcohol compare that to

235
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:46,200
gambling compare that to people who eat

236
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:47,360
too much sugar for feet sakes and uh uh

237
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,240
right now they're going to we're going

238
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,759
to have to look at the marijuana

239
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,320
business financially should be treated

240
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:57,120
like any other business and my darn

241
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,120
Republican friends should understand

242
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,120
what that means there you go

243
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:11,759
so so thank you Congressman I I hope

244
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:13,838
it's true two years I uh am very hopeful

245
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,799
but we have to prepare in case it

246
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:21,360
doesn't um this year Susan Bonia had a

247
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:23,639
bill AB 2149 that would allow the Boe to

248
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,440
collect the fees for all of these new

249
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:29,360
agencies who are going to be

250
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,640
licensing um all of you the uh

251
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,159
Department of food and egg the

252
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,720
Department of Consumer Affairs

253
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,559
Department of Public Health Department

254
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,839
of Fish and Wildlife now

255
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:42,199
if number one there is no banking access

256
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,160
and everyone is still paying cash where

257
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:49,399
is everyone going to go to pay all these

258
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:52,278
fees one place in Sacramento I mean so

259
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,679
we are hoping that the Boe we have 23

260
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:56,600
offices around the state that we will be

261
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,439
able to accept these payments and

262
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,959
unfortunately that bill got stuck but

263
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,000
we're gonna uh try to move it next year

264
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,439
because um we're hopeful but we also

265
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,600
have to prepare and I have been studying

266
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,519
this for a good year uh Tim Morland and

267
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,480
I have been trying we've met with

268
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:17,560
everyone talked with everyone have gone

269
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,000
through every scenario and unfortunately

270
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:22,879
until the Congress acts and allows

271
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,200
banking access we are kind of stuck here

272
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:27,799
in California unless we figure out how

273
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,519
we're going to create our own State Bank

274
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,278
or expand the service

275
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,440
of the Boe since we have been collecting

276
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:37,278
taxes right for 20 years um so that's

277
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,920
kind of where we're we're at right now

278
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,600

279

federal offense the FFA regulates it the

00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:06,480
that we're so that every one of our

312
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:10,240
patients are not breaking the law I

313
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,759
don't have a u a Magic Bullet on this

314
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,480
this is a we are evolving out of the

315
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:19,919
most stupid law in the history of our

316
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,199
country and there's no way that we're

317
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:26,719
going to shoot through all of those

318
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:29,078
years of idiocy in which in which our

319
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,160
our public officials were spent spending

320
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:35,638
their time uh trying to control our

321
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:38,799
private behavior and especially the

322
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,480
private behavior in terms of consuming

323
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:45,759
uh you know

324
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:50,000
marijuana uh so that was and as we know

325
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:53,000
look Canada grows hemp and we've just we

326
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,480
can't even grow hemp to make a rope and

327
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,879
we're denying our Farmers a billion and

328
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,959
a half dollars a year where that's how

329
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:02,838
much Canada makes for selling the hemp

330
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:05,719
to us just for rope and not to mention

331
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,720
the other uses for for hemp and and

332
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,680
marijuana and things so look there's no

333
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:14,480
easy answer I'm sorry just going to take

334
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:17,919
day after day year after year reform

335
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,480
after reform we got to walk it back and

336
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:22,240
it's going to take about 5 years before

337
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,480
it's probably going to be a point where

338
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,879
we can all say well this is now

339
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,120
operating like a full regular business

340
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,240
well and then my question is then on

341
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,480
with regards the DEA is there anything

342
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:39,360
from a Grassroots level on up we can do

343
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,639
to get them to resched reschedule that

344
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,000
as a class one instead of waiting for

345
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:47,680
them because they just denied it again

346
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,559
well the secret is that uh uh we don't

347
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,758
want them to reschedule we want them to

348
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,758
deschedule

349
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,759
so

350
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:01,519
so yeah right this is a yeah but yeah I

351
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,519
know that's what you meant but that's

352
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,159
not what they meant I've got to tell you

353
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,399
right now they know that they know what

354
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,759
they're doing and oh yes we go to

355
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:13,198
schedule too that's wonderful they can

356
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:16,399
control all of us just as much and uh it

357
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,278
would disaster for everybody who's gone

358
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,480
out of the way to try to help people

359
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:22,838
especially in the medical marijuana area

360
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,278
a total disaster for the whole medical

361
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:28,279
marijuana option so uh uh no we listen

362
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:32,000
we got to walk it back we got to uh what

363
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:33,679
I just said you guys applauded you get a

364
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,559
majority members of Congress wouldn't

365
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:39,879
know what the hell we were talking about

366
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:42,719
and so uh you got to get their attention

367
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:45,039
go see your Congressman get the Vets to

368
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,360
go with you get the seniors to go with

369
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,759
you and uh uh and other people that can

370
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,639
just talk to them and that's the way you

371
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,560
do it and I'm sorry I wish I could be

372
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,799
more optimistic that there's going to be

373
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,359
one bill passed next year that's going

374
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,198
to solve the financial part of it so but

375
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,759
we will move forward we'll try our best

376
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:07,679
so thank you very much uh and I and I

377
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:11,720
just want to offer you know the the

378
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:15,198
congressman is right about getting the

379
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:18,440
right-minded individuals in Congress

380
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:21,599
that will ultimately move on this issue

381
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,600
now I I believe that hopefully after

382
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,319
November there will be a Congress and

383
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,600
the Senate and that the president that

384
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:32,958
she will be able to make the

385
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,040
changes that we

386
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:41,039
need to like the congressman

387
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:41,838
said deschedule it not reschedule it uh

388
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,679
because

389
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,800
ultimately uh any agency will only go as

390
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:51,198
far is what Congress the Senate and the

391
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:55,559
president will let them and so yes it's

392
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:58,000
important to go and in insist that your

393
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:01,278
elected officials are are on the same

394
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,480
page as you and deal with reality for me

395
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:06,679
why it's personal because cannabis in

396
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,519
the African-American Community Latino

397
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,959
Community has been devastating it's been

398
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,558
used to lock up more Latino and

399
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,400
African-American individuals in this

400
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:19,519
country than ever before and it's

401
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,839
another form of incarceration or what we

402
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:26,240
call the prison Plantation in a lot of

403
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,240
ways a form of slavery

404
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,160
and

405
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:35,279
we've got to make that change we've got

406
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,759
to get that message through and the

407
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,399
reason I talk about the public safety

408
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,359
aspect they're using it to not

409
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,280
reschedule it they're using the the

410
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:50,240
harms the supposed harms that come from

411
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:52,359
it to convince others that we can't do

412
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,679
anything or to paralyze elected

413
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:55,599
officials and I'll say both Democrats

414
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,120
and

415
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:01,839
Republicans um to not move on this issue

416
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:06,439
and and so it is imperative it's

417
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:09,678
imperative that as alcohol was way back

418
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,240
when was considered harmful and no one

419
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:16,559
wanted to to bring it

420
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:19,159
back it is our responsibility to ensure

421
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:22,359
that people understand what the true

422
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,880
safety aspects of it so that the DEA

423
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:27,558
will have the Comfort level to either

424
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,480
get out of the way or to advise the

425
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:32,480
Congress the Senate and the president so

426
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,640
that we can make some substantive moves

427
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,240
on this issue uh my question is

428
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,640
specifically to Mr Reggie Jones this is

429
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,359
uh regarding AB 2385 which I believe you

430
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,880
authored and the ucba have been the

431
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:48,759
backers of this is the same organization

432
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,880
that a couple of weeks ago in the city

433
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:56,359
hall meeting were the only opposition to

434
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:59,400
an opening up the licensing Market in LA

435
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:02,038
to specifically um allow for a more

436
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:06,280
diverse market and ownership rather than

437
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:09,119
just people that work for the 43 or 65

438
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:11,319
white dispensary owners um now since the

439
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,399
city of B has really changed their

440
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:15,558
stance on it and are looking to the

441
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,120
community to get feedback and are really

442
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:20,798
interested in a licensing system uh do

443
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:24,158
you plan on withdrawing that bill or

444
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:28,440
amending it so it will be a fair market

445
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:34,200
to everyone rather than a specific um

446
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:37,480
say leeway to a very select group so so

447
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,840
measure D is that the one you're

448
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,839
referring

449
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:47,360
to gives and basically waves the

450
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,200
requirement for a city permitting to the

451
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,599
people that had that were measured de

452
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,440
comped it and it also allows for the

453
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:58,519
local government the Cil Los Angeles

454
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,480
which I'm from the ability to open open

455
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:03,558
up the market to others right now they

456
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:08,038
feel that they're prohibited because of

457
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:10,720
the the the measure D law and in between

458
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:12,000
when we make the regulation when we've

459
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,038
ultimately have all the rules and

460
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,558
Regulation and now it gives the city of

461
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,879
Los Angeles especially the elected

462
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,839
officials there the city council and the

463
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,039
mayor and to some extent the City

464
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:26,038
attorney an opportunity to either go

465
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:28,319
back to the citizens or to create laws

466
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:32,200
so that they can become a little more

467
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:34,639
inclusive um their challenge is they

468
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,480
have as you said they very few

469
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:41,840
135 dispensaries but they're dealing

470
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:47,440
with close to 1,400 dispensaries in Los

471
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:50,519
Angeles and my concern is is is not the

472
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,960
legal ones or the potential legal ones

473
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:54,599
and the concern of the council are

474
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,679
probably the hundreds and hundreds of

475
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:59,839
the illegal ones that give all of you a

476
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:02,000
bad name that that that have been open

477
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,359
we've got to be a little more diligent

478
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,759
and we got to be a little more not a

479
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:09,519
little more we got to be a lot more uh

480
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:11,519
responsive to closing those down so that

481
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,879
those of you who are working here will

482
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,879
not be saddled with what they're

483
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:19,918
doing and that's what measure D is

484
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:22,119
supposed I mean that's what the bill is

485
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,559
supposed to do and I just like to say

486
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:27,719
the Boe we love

487
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:30,000
referrals so you can refer people over

488
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,400
to us I'm just

489
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,400
kidding Dana my question is for you um

490
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,159
and and an extreme amount of gratitude I

491
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,080
have for you for defunding the

492
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,600
Department of Justice from going after

493
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:43,839
legitimate um compliant businesses

494
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,798
however um we've we're now seeing some

495
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:48,399
Rogue agencies that aren't necessarily

496

00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:01,440
options to stop this from happening

501
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:04,038
happening it's actually called Trident

they did identify themselves I don't

512
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,320
believe that there were any DEA agents

513
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:36,720
present they just pulled in people from

514

you know where they go in and act like

520
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,319
like a criminal gang and like a bunch of

521
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:58,239
marauders breaking into people's homes

522
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,200
you know just you know one of the one of

523
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,759
the things we have a horrible situation

524
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,159
in our country right now and right as we

525
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:10,440
speak and it's not this it's that we've

526
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,760
got black Americans and law enforcement

527
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,558
in the in a dynamic that's a horrible

528
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:17,558
horrible Dynamic where they're both

529
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:21,158
feeding on each other's fear and they're

530
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:24,119
feeding on each other hatred Etc this is

531
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:26,159
police the more police officers get

532
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,599
somebody shoots at them the more they

533
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,880
shoot a bunch of people where then shoot

534
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,359
at police officers this is a horrible

535
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,000
cycle and let me tell you the marijuana

536
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,439
element of this is there's a there's

537
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,440
there's an element of huge element the

538
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:45,120
guy the fellow they just shot the other

539
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:48,840
day you know oh well hey he had some

540
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:51,959
marijuana on him well big deal you know

541
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,359
the bottom line is that this law has

542
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,720
done more to cause the hatred between

543
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,639
the police who should be there to

544
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,319
protect people in all every one of our

545
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,759
communities and are but they we put them

546
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,038
at odds with honest citizens and of

547
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,240
course what they say this the other guy

548
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,879
they also said well he had a gun I'm

549
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,240
sorry I'm sure some people disagree with

550
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,400
me on this who cares if he has a gun if

551
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,120
he's an honest person is protecting

552
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,559
himself I don't care if he has a gun and

553
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,639
I don't care if he has a baggie of

554
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:25,359
marijuana either the bottom line is that

555
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,840
he was no threat to anybody else and the

556
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,639
police a lot of police will use

557
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:33,119
marijuana as an excuse in the black and

558
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,480
Chico neighborhoods and you know of

559
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:38,119
course if if a kid from an affluent

560
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,679
neighborhood gets arrested we know what

561
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:43,199
happens his mommy and daddy get the

562
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,840
lawyer and this guy not only doesn't he

563
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,558
have it's expunged from his record and

564
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:50,278
and they be lucky if they spent even one

565
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:53,639
day in jail but in the in the poor

566
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:55,839
communities you end up with giving a guy

567
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,440
a mark on his record that will prevent

568
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:01,839
him from getting work 10 years down the

569
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,519
road and ruins his life so I these

570
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,199
people if there are groups of people

571
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,359
running around with uniforms and all

572
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,519
kinds of

573
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:12,918
badges molesting the people who are not

574
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:14,119
doing any harm to anybody else the only

575
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,038
thing that's going to do we've got to

576
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:19,398
rise up and make sure that the uh that

577
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,960
there's some basic change in our country

578
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:23,239
by the way I thought you were talking

579
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,480
about International things and there's

580
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,240
another look do not give authority to

581
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,880
International organizations

582
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,720
if you think that the oppression that we

583
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,278
suffer here are bad wait till you give

584
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,880
uh Global government the right to do

585
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:40,440
some of these things what a horror story

586
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,760
so I don't know if I answered your

587
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,200
question or not but yeah and and please

588
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:46,200
let us know because I'm looking at my

589
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,960
staff and we haven't heard about it and

590
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,120
a lot of times when there's raids in the

591
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,360
community um we do get calls and we're

592
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:55,079
trying to figure out who it is where it

593
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,639
is who authorized it who was on The Raid

594
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:58,519
what was the purpose who had the

595
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,840
warrants um um and we have not heard

596
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:03,359
about this one so um Tim Morin right

597
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:06,959
there if you can exchange cards with him

598
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:09,959
um we will follow up on this thank you

599
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,240
thank you next question

600
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,240
last this is the last

601
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,399
question well I want to thank you all

602
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,359
for all the work you've done on this but

603
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:21,798
I do have one question for Reggie Smith

604
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,158
I met you last year for the grower and

605
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:25,359
I'm a grower and I'm probably one of the

606
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:28,159
few people here who's a grower so I need

607
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,678
to represent them the biggest burden for

608
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,760
growers in the Marissa is the

609
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:36,440
distribution system and we find that

610
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,759
that is going to kill us all the law

611
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,440
says every movement of a product from

612
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:43,640
one lensey to another lensey must be

613
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,038
done by a distributor is that going to

614
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,278
change because if it doesn't all the

615
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:51,640
small Growers are just dead in the water

616
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:54,640
run out of business by the alcohol

617
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,640
industry

618
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,679
so I know when when that discussion came

619
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,558
up there was a

620
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:05,880
very cognitive decision that was made

621
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,359
about the

622
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,760
distributorship um we can talk about

623
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:14,918
ways that is not honorous on the Growers

624
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:18,038
but for for and I'll just use the word

625
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:20,278
bureaucrat because I I used I was one at

626
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:25,599
one time

627
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:30,759
um we have to ensure that the product

628
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:34,719
gets to the the the sail point that

629
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:37,158
everything is is not only legal but it's

630
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,240
safe and that we can tax and that and

631
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:41,679
and that's what that discussion was

632
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,599
really about I'm just I'm telling you

633
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,798
the reality of it um and I'm perfectly

634
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:49,719
willing after this to talk to you about

635
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,798
making sure that it's not owner on it um

636
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:56,200
I know law enforcement had a concern

637
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:58,720
about straight point to sale but we we

638
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,720
get not a butt and we can discuss it

639
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,079
right after this so I can come up with

640
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,480
some solutions for

641
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,639
you I hear you as as an association I'll

642
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,240
just speak on it real quick it's our

643
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,480
number one priority is to fix that as as

644
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,960
as soon as we can the reality is with

645
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,640
the distribution companies who kind of

646
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,440
came into like try and force some of

647
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,759
those issues on there didn't even

648
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,120
understand what they were getting on

649
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:22,240
them the amount of liability they were

650
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:24,879
going to have to have so there is a lot

651
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,640
of room to to to move on this we've

652
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,039
already been having discussions with

653
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,799
some of the labor unions who were

654
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:31,599
working on this and I me and you will

655
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:34,000
also have some discussions some more

656
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,158
detail but as as a trade Association

657
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,720
that's is our number one priority is

658
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,080
