1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,339
I'm here with Eric and Todd from

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,918
organics alive we're sort of social

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:12,660
distancing but we're gonna build some

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:15,178
soil from scratch for Tom who's off

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:27,810
camera but we'll see him in a second for

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:32,600
his backyard six plank row we got so we

7
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:40,589
got a whole bunch of babies ready to go

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:53,520
into a grass roots fabric Patrias bed

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:58,410
okay baby girl no no I just keep her

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:02,309
over there so I guess I'm gonna let you

11
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:07,349
guys gem up can you be quiet for one

12
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:14,759
second so I'll let you guys take it away

13
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:18,060
but basically I the idea is you know for

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,359
home growers in their backyard how do

15
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,769
you build a soil up so let you guys take

16
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,599
it away yeah well for you know I'd say

17
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,219
for kind of like the beginning stage get

18
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,459
things going we like to keep it as

19
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,200
simple as possible and as you begin to

20
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,819
you know get involved with your plant

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,019
get involved with your soil start to

22
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,679
understand a little bit about soil

23
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:43,379
biology you know compost the soil food

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,680
web we're gonna show you a real easy way

25
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:49,438
to make a very very simple and

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,090
successful soil and then and then start

27
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,739
to explore into how you making your own

28
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,840
soil and taking different components and

29
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,158
adding them at different ratios and as

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,329
soon as you start getting the getting

31
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,799
the hang of things getting the flow of

32
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:01,408
things it just gets funnier and funnier

33
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,820
try to put that together so so so one of

34
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,310
the interesting things is you guys

35
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,408
literally went to this what what store

36
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,689
did you go to we went down in near San

37
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,540
Clemente will give a we'll give them a

38
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:12,889
what do you call that

39
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:14,628
like a Hydra store yeah it's a height

40
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:16,188
you know it's a Hydra store we'll give

41
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:19,578
them a shout-out it's its beach cities

42
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:21,229
down a communal Capistrano and just a

43
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:24,620
normal hydro store and honestly we got

44
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:26,479
the the most I think the most one of the

45
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,329
most popular soils which is just Fox

46
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,009
farm you know they're everywhere it's a

47
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:32,989
great it's a great soil but there are

48
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:34,699
some things we're gonna add to it so

49
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:36,140
this way because we like a different

50
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:38,328
type of consistency you would like to

51
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:39,888
add some elements one of the elements

52
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:42,579
we're gonna add here is our premium mix

53
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:45,799
our premium mix from organics alive is

54
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:47,959
worm castings some really nice vegetable

55
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:50,150
compost and a little bit of mineral to

56
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,759
add in there and the vegetable compost

57
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,530
is 32 one carbon nitrogen so we're gonna

58
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,408
get into that in a little bit but carbon

59
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,539
nitrogen is a really great element to

60
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:01,848
kind of look at in regards to how your

61
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:04,668
your biology is going to grow especially

62
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:07,009
the balance of your biology so we're

63
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:08,870
gonna add that to just the simple

64
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:14,090
potting soil and then we're gonna add a

65
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:18,500
little bit of the bridge a there that's

66
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:19,848
just a peat a normal peat product we

67
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,219
find this good quality and good

68
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:23,810
consistency as well but one of the

69
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:25,519
interesting things was when he went to

70
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,969
the Hydra store they were out of like

71
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,930
everything right we were looking for a

72
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:36,289
roots roots potting soil and there they

73
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,699
were they were back order on that and

74
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:39,408
then a couple other other other

75
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:41,479
companies too it seems like this year

76
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:43,969
there is quite quite a some action in

77
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:46,819
both the compost area and the soil area

78
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:49,810
so and that's not normal like yes I've

79
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:54,500
never honestly I've never ever seen that

80
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:56,930
kind of you know like a like a backorder

81
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,158
on soil like that though but that's

82
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,409
great that's great news it means

83
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,030
everybody's gardening that's what we

84
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:05,120
need we need more gardening so how do

85
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:08,900
you guys determine how much you need to

86
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,209
mix for whatever purpose you're using it

87
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:15,319
for yeah we did the simple math on the

88
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:18,590
container it's a 4 by 4 by 16 inch bed

89
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:20,538
and so that's about 20 cubic feet

90
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,089
roughly and then it'll come back down a

91
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:25,189
little bit with water as well so doing

92
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:28,549
the math on how many cubic feet

93
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:33,709
soyal to amendment we we like to add our

94
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:35,150
castings at attend the up 15% ratio so

95
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:37,789
we're starting with you know like you

96
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:39,649
said good base organic blend this one's

97
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,990
already pre amended with a lot of

98
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:46,099
additives like shrimp and crab meal and

99
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:48,470
different oceanic food sources for the

100
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,689
biology that we have within our castings

101
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,460
one of the things I really like in here

102
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:56,449
is the shrimp and the cat crab meal it

103
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:59,120
contains chitin and the way we feed our

104
00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:00,979
worms we get chitin and cellulose

105
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,780
degraders and these are certain

106
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,300
microorganisms that will help to digest

107
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:07,219
and create enzymes that help that will

108
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,210
increase the sugars of the plants and

109
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,860
different responses for overall strength

110
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:15,620
and health and immunity for the whole

111
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,470
system so it's good good based potting

112
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,019
soil to start with and then like we were

113
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:23,480
saying our castings are a little bit

114
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:24,859
dense so in the mix we like to add a

115
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:29,000
little bit of something with a higher

116
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,250
porosity so we went with the purge a

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,589
through adding a little bale of this in

118
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:41,230
there it has extra perlite and peat not

119
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:41,229
as much compost to retain the moisture

120
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:50,089
and give it a little fluff as it comes

121
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:53,030
out of the Bale so the environment we're

122
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:57,589
creating now is this is this good for

123
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:58,819
any type of plants or specific types of

124
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:01,549
plants or can you grow anything here

125
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:04,310
it's a really good base mix to be honest

126
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,350
for any raised bed it's definitely your

127
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,230
higher end because we're buying the best

128
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,090
inputs possible if we're gonna get the

129
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,120
best outcome in the end from that you

130
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,119
know

131
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:28,490
and so the idea is over like you you'd

132
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,650
start with kind of a a mix that's not

133
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,569
jammed packed with nutrients and then

134
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:35,089
over time because I mean these are

135
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:37,278
babies right now right mm-hmm

136
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:39,769
so being babies we want to make sure

137
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:42,800
that the soil is not going to be hot as

138
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:44,448
well so if you mix a soil on your own

139
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,199
and you're adding too many different

140
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:50,658
meals and and inputs you could create a

141
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,650
hot environment which is like an excess

142
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:54,348
of nitrogens

143
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:56,269
and and and phosphorous --is that can

144
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:59,060
potentially burn your roots to your

145
00:06:56,269 --> 00:07:01,430
plant and damage a seedling as it goes

146
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,430
in one of our ways to help mitigate that

147
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:06,588
is through our biology once we water and

148
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,658
we get the worm castings and our

149
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:10,459
microorganisms kicking in there they're

150
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:12,019
gonna start consuming all those excess

151
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:14,269
nitrates and nitrites that could

152
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:17,120
potentially burn your plant when it goes

153
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:20,028
in there and then also by using our

154
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,278
microbial rich solution right away by

155
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:26,319
doing that by brewing up that that's

156
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:29,509
gonna be your other great benefit to

157
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,789
mitigate any potential burn or hotness

158
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:33,528
in your soil mix and that could

159
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:34,788
potentially come from the soil yard

160
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:37,310
you're not even knowing and then not

161
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:39,438
intending by not totally composting

162
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:43,629
their compost or there's many issues

163
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,629
that can occur to cause that

164
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:54,800
yeah you can already see you know the

165
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:54,799
difference in the richness and the color

166
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:02,069
this really just helps cut that down a

167
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,800
little bit and you fluff up the soil so

168
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:06,750
you have better water a water drainage

169
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,728
and water retention at the same time

170
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,709
gives it that real nice balance now you

171
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:13,168
said your castings were what was the

172
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:15,628
word you used thick or they're heavier

173
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:17,758
what did you say castings in general are

174
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:21,300
a little bit dense dense yeah a little

175
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,569
bit dense so really in soil blends you

176
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,930
know ten to twenty percent is really the

177
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:29,370
threshold minimum five percent but

178
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,780
depending on how you like the

179
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,000
consistency and how you want to wat

180
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:36,179
water and where your location is I'd say

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,089
the maximum would be 20 20 percent what

182
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:42,449
is that 20 percent density of the entire

183
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:44,370
blend oh yeah you know five four four

184
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:48,180
bags or five bags one of those bags

185
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:52,769
would essentially be a premium mix of

186
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:54,979
castings and so with the math being

187
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:58,740
about 20 cubic feet within the container

188
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,420
will add 1:1 or add a little bit of our

189
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,789
castings that will get us to that 10% so

190
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:04,799
at this point in your guys experience do

191
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:07,588
you put this together just kind of I

192
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,059
feel yeah definitely by experience you

193
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:12,000
know we've used a lot of the soils on

194
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,979
the market and then experience different

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,350
densities throughout our time growing so

196
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,990
we found that you know having this type

197
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,860
of consistency is the best for plants

198
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,450
because it really gives them an

199
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,490
opportunity to breathe and that's what's

200
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,160
happening with your soil as they're as

201
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,200
they're breathing they're drying they're

202
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,449
watering so it's it's almost you want to

203
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,450
have that two day three day watering

204
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:37,440
period to really make sure your plants

205
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:41,550
are extending roots and growing real

206
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,140
healthy for the fun part and so we're

207
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:45,539
gonna add now this is kind of the secret

208
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:47,759
sauce of any good soil blend would be

209
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:49,799
your your premium mix organics life

210
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,069
premium mixer or a very good worm

211
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:55,019
casting slash vegetable compost it's

212
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,990
always going to be a great addition and

213
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:01,379
a lot of the biology is going to come

214
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:03,899
from the the worm castings

215
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:07,019
so you want to make sure you you have

216
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:09,808
enough enough diversity a good balance

217
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:12,359
of biology to come from those worm

218
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:14,308
castings so like the bag you have right

219
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:16,589
now are the castings just evenly

220
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:19,438
distributed throughout the bag exactly

221
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:23,459
so this is actually a specific ratio we

222
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:26,568
have 47% worm castings or 52% worm

223
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:29,338
castings 47% compost and the rest being

224
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:31,438
mineral and we've put fossilized kelp in

225
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,139
there which is a which is great for

226
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:37,019
calcium calcium magnesium source and

227
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:39,298
then also the biology we'll use them as

228
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,879
attachment sites to grow and that's your

229
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:45,899
that's your product right yep so you you

230
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:47,749
created those that mix and you design

231
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:52,739
exactly you can develop that yeah okay

232
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:53,489
this premium mix we designed in 2002 to

233
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:56,519
complement

234
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:59,369
just the pure castings by adding the

235
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:03,619
compost the compost really adds a more

236
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:06,449
moisture holding capacity as well as

237
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:10,859
carbon and nitrogen food source for the

238
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:12,719
microorganisms in the cast means well

239
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:15,600
and what made you guys decide to start

240
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,339
your own nutrient company you know there

241
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,819
wasn't really that much organics on the

242
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:23,129
shelves back in the late 90s and early

243
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:24,358
2000s you know there was a lot of there

244
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:28,259
was a couple companies out there but it

245
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:30,720
was mostly casting yeah it was mostly a

246
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:33,658
lot of synthetics and you know indoor

247
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,309
hydroponics and things like that so we

248
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:37,769
started to play around with our own

249
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:39,958
nutrient or our own soil blends when we

250
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:42,229
start to dig into soils a little bit we

251
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,818
understand it that kind of led us to

252
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:46,439
understanding the soil food web anise

253
00:11:44,818 --> 00:11:49,198
oil food web led us to understand how we

254
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:50,668
can retain the obtain the best biology

255
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:53,308
and then that took us into vermiculture

256
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:55,739
and from there we started to put

257
00:11:53,308 --> 00:12:00,149
together different feeds for worms which

258
00:11:55,739 --> 00:12:03,119
then you know inspires the the red

259
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:05,220
wiggler to put out a casting that's high

260
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:07,798
quality so so you grow or you guys

261
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,389
growers as well exactly yeah and that's

262
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:12,749
kind of how this all started just just

263
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:15,180
being growers and then from there we you

264
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:17,070
know biology took us into fermentation

265
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:21,509
and then that's kind of where the whole

266
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:24,839
line began to take take hold so it's

267
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:27,210
been a really fun journey so are we

268
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,650
creating a living soil environment you

269
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,930
know we are this is kind of the

270
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:33,778
beginning phases of the living soil

271
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:35,729
especially adding this especially adding

272
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:37,769
this this type of biology and having the

273
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:41,039
the carbon nitrogen that we're adding

274
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:42,419
via the compost and then from here you

275
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,539
know you'll you'll probably have great

276
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:47,629
guests that can talk about to cover

277
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:50,309
crops and the diversity of cover crops

278
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:52,919
when when one cycle is done what are the

279
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:55,079
best ways to add nutrients back into

280
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:56,879
your soil via cover crops so our goal is

281
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,129
to take this one base that's super

282
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,919
simple to put together at the proper

283
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:04,950
biology via worm castings and then from

284
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,659
there you'll begin to say okay I want to

285
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,650
keep the soil in here because it's you

286
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:08,909
know you don't want to keep taking it

287
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:10,829
out or it's it's a waste it's

288
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:13,110
unsustainable and it gets expensive and

289
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,430
how to just kind of keep soil alive in a

290
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,860
bed like this and it's really easy

291
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:19,469
actually in a bed like this a four by

292
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,180
four from grass roots is is its it's

293
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,800
perfect for a living bed that's what we

294
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:24,750
use actually for our garden do most

295
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,859
people assume that you need to create a

296
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:34,200
living soil environment in the ground

297
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:35,519
like I might have assumed that yeah what

298
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,910
we're doing is we're putting right food

299
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,338
sources to sustain that microbial

300
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:48,240
process and then the right microbe so

301
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:50,550
that they're in a balance as well so

302
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,500
we've done is we've added the premium

303
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:59,699
mix did you see it and then added a the

304
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:02,789
worm castings as well so we've done both

305
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:06,660
additions here just the classic soil in

306
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:10,230
the hand are you appreciating no shovel

307
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:11,850
or no rake you know this was an

308
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:16,440
old-school method then we're gonna

309
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:20,070
continue it yes so your worm castings

310
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,260
soil is much darker mm-hmm yes you're

311
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,180
pure worm castings mmm there is no

312
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:27,208
compost in that one in that pure

313
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:28,639
castings oh that's pure caster that's

314
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:31,789
the pure worm castings

315
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:35,539
which they are certified organic

316
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:35,539
California Department of Food and

317
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:54,509
Agriculture end product from that

318
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:57,509
digestion process of the worm and we use

319
00:14:54,509 --> 00:15:02,610
the red wigglers as well for the

320
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:07,319
castings and yes appreciating no shovel

321
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:10,110
very much and so a lot of people talk

322
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,570
about you know like bone meal kelp meal

323
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,850
blood meal

324
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:19,410
mycorrhizal fungi like what what are you

325
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:22,350
in the early stages can you talk about

326
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:23,789
kind of like some of the things that

327
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,639
people think they always need to add

328
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:28,649
that you either do or don't add and why

329
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,970
yeah you know a lot of the base soil if

330
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:32,250
you look on the ingredients kind of have

331
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,139
a lot of those or if you look on the

332
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,539
back of the soil they've added a lot of

333
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,159
those ingredients for you and they're

334
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:40,709
pretty experienced and how they put it

335
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,649
together so it's a good ratio you don't

336
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,879
want to put too much too many meals or

337
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:49,559
different blends because it can really

338
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:52,529
get hot but those are good additions to

339
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:56,579
add as you want to add food sources

340
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:58,409
along the way and that's just different

341
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,170
stages for the plant's life as well

342
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:02,669
because you only use a high nitrogen

343
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:05,009
possible source right as you go into

344
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:09,088
flour you'd rather use you know a nice

345
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:12,299
potassium or phosphorus source Ben

346
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:14,040
amendment so how is this blend looking

347
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:17,039
right now it's looking great you can see

348
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:19,289
it lightened up a little bit and and

349
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,969
what do you want to look for is it a is

350
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:23,669
it I like a shade a color

351
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:27,060
or when you know you're you've reached

352
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:30,329
your the consistency that you're looking

353
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:31,859
for for me you'd be water drainage when

354
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,450
you get to the right water holding

355
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,930
capacity oh okay

356
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,670
fourth for your desire for how quickly

357
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,319
it is that's something you can feel in

358
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:42,439
your hands what we can do is we can take

359
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,330
a smaller container

360
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,610
and we can simply fill this up and run a

361
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,410
quick drainage test on it gotcha

362
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,990
and if we put the water through it and

363
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:54,120
we find it just sits on top and it's not

364
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,789
penetrating we're gonna want to add some

365
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,210
more of our high porosity perlite coco

366
00:16:56,789 --> 00:17:03,449
something like that vermiculite pumice

367
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:04,620
lava rock something to fluff it up that

368
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,870
means you probably put too much of our

369
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:10,199
castings or the original soil blend

370
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:12,599
itself was rather dense so that's kind

371
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,039
of our key is bring some water over here

372
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,029
to do it or do it right here absolutely

373
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:17,690
right on the grass

374
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:17,690
okay right here

375
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:31,249
[Music]

376
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:54,740
yeah you know these rows ophea if you

377
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:58,880
put them together they're about 15 miles

378
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:04,279
and long and 58 feet wide and yeah so

379
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:07,310
and they're in there outside where this

380
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:20,539
is near Central California yeah yeah

381
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:22,730
coast a little bit you so there are

382
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:24,920
particular types of worms that provide

383
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:28,519
better castings yeah we find that the

384
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:32,539
red wiggler is a is a great worm because

385
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:36,559
of its its ability to compost and the

386
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:38,450
speed at which it compost it also its

387
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,009
food source is the biology that's doing

388
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,680
the composting so where do you find them

389
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:49,879
red wigglers you can you can they're

390
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:50,960
they're available you know online you

391
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,090
can find them they'll send you a couple

392
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,380
pounds sure if we took a scoop of your

393
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:57,439
soil right later you might have some

394
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:02,900
yeah underneath the grass right in the

395
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,960
root zone what do you you said chitin so

396
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,790
is that something you're you're like

397
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,210
what are you putting into the worm a

398
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:13,579
high chitin diet so anything like a for

399
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:16,910
ask that they can consume you know so

400
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:18,949
you will happen is you have Fras a type

401
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:22,340
of frass or a shell or a chitin shell

402
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:24,410
that you'll that you'll pulverize and

403
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:26,359
what will happen is that will attract

404
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,900
actual chitin degraders and then the red

405
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:31,549
wigglers will consume those and then

406
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:34,040
encapsulated in their casting and then

407
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:36,980
that now that chitin degraders that's

408
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:38,720
part of the recycling part of biology is

409
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:41,329
now encapsulated in that worm casting

410
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,720
when you put it in the soil and water it

411
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:47,000
it basically based it on our recipe

412
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,829
it'll come out of that worm casting and

413
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,750
start to eat some of the chitin elements

414
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:52,069
that are in here so some of the shell

415
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,410
that and that's kind of like why we like

416
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:57,829
more seafood I should say from

417
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,570
to see food sources like the shell and

418
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,519
the crab that Eric was talking about

419
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:03,169
because what that does is that that

420
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,000
gives the ability for food for those

421
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,550
chitin degraders and they'll start to

422
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,559
multiply and kinda graders and cellulose

423
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:12,619
degraders they release cellulase and in

424
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:15,379
chitin days and those actually help with

425
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:19,219
the immunity of the plant and they

426
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:21,200
searched after pathogens so it's a it's

427
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,920
chitin cellulose degraders are a really

428
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,700
important part of the the biological

429
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:31,310
food web looks good that's great

430
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:38,299
so should we test we're ready for a

431
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:42,639
drainage system so we'll go ahead and

432
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:45,109
let it fall in and you can see it really

433
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,360
just absorb into the soil right away

434
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:49,759
it's not getting pooling on top too much

435
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:58,639
and we're doing a pretty quick watering

436
00:20:49,759 --> 00:21:02,619
and gone correct yeah so very nice

437
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,880
concerns now could it drain so quickly

438
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:06,619
potentially yes so once you pick it up

439
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,330
you can actually see how much water

440
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:09,559
holding capacity dies by squeezing the

441
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:12,849
reaming out yeah and what are you

442
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:14,990
looking for well nice medium you know

443
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:17,059
you wouldn't want this to clump together

444
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,190
and to stay together say when you bounce

445
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:21,379
it like that that would mean that you

446
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,480
had too much compost or maybe some soil

447
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,040
and it wouldn't win it standing up like

448
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,529
that is what you want to see correct

449
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,299
yeah so when you clump it together there

450
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:31,099
was too much composted probably more

451
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:36,409
stick together and wouldn't just fall

452
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:38,839
apart nicely in your hand and it

453
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,070
wouldn't quite still be able to mix so

454
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,409
it's like lazy no it's got to be

455
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:44,179
breathable correct yeah it would become

456
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:46,640
very cakey you wouldn't be able to

457
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:53,420
separate it in the back end of the fines

458
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:56,360
like baked it's like how so we can add

459
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,880
more water to it and oh that's okay I

460
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,740
think we have a good reading on it it

461
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,030
looks nice to me for the for the bed

462
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,160
what do you think let's try looking

463
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:08,000
great yeah

464
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,300
so our ratio was about 7 cubic seven and

465
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,450
a half

466
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:17,210
cubic feet of our high porosity mix 10

467
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:20,029
cubic feet of the of the amended potting

468
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:23,329
soil blend and then 2 cubic feet of our

469
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:25,250
castings so far so you got about 20

470
00:22:23,329 --> 00:22:27,710
percent of the the organics live

471
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:30,859
castings in there which is a great great

472
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:34,340
ratio actually out here gets hot - yeah

473
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:36,199
you're up in the hundreds yeah so having

474
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:37,490
it retained knowing that impact so you

475
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,920
want to retain a little bit more

476
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,569
moisture just to keep them happy on

477
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,720
those hot hot days and so you don't have

478
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:46,099
to continuously water I don't save a lot

479
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,039
of water and the plant I'll just kind of

480
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:51,139
stay a cool over overall and also

481
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,659
container size if if we were planting

482
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,460
directly into this container and I knew

483
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,880
that before I was going to be filming

484
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:02,660
you know my six plants but usually she

485
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:07,100
knows what I would probably make a more

486
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:08,960
porous mixture if it was if it was for a

487
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:12,259
small container I would make it slightly

488
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,329
more porous then if it's for the larger

489
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:15,799
bed because we want to sustain a little

490
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:18,049
longer watering you wouldn't want it to

491
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:21,259
dry out on the outside real quickly

492
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:22,759
before the middle does but where this we

493
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:25,670
would if we would afford more of that

494
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:27,859
breathability within the soil blend so

495
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:30,080
it's up for me it's always custom per

496
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:34,659
where I'm going with it is that

497
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,659
modification follows the larger

498
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:42,049
more moisture in there like you can

499
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:44,119
double that yeah because if you think

500
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:46,159
about the soil ground itself

501
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:47,569
that's very retained it has very high

502
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,580
water retention you only need to water

503
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:51,139
every few days if you have a good you

504
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:53,629
know where we're trying to water every

505
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,030
day in these containers just have it

506
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,100
breathe properly and the four by four

507
00:23:56,029 --> 00:24:00,589
maybe we're back to that every other day

508
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:02,449
watering even further out than that on

509
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:03,919
one in the beginning at the end when the

510
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,080
plants are really drinking will end up

511
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,390
watering more frequently but right now

512
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,189
it's gonna hold nice moisture and then

513
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,440
also the way we water the bed is very

514
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,420
important because we don't want to just

515
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,429
continue soaking especially a seedling

516
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,650
when we transplant it so we can go into

517
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:19,880
some of those techniques later but yeah

518
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,890
it's all about you because too much

519
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,050
water can also be there do you guys have

520
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,210
experience with Otto Wow Otto flowering

521
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:29,019
plants we have experience with people

522
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,019
with experience

523
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:43,689
all right so do we want to move that now

524
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:45,130
and let's put it in Italy I'd say we can

525
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,930
drag it to where it's gonna go and we

526
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,550
could probably take the whole tarp by

527
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:50,640
coroner's and everybody just drag this

528
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:56,980
thing over to it and then hump it in and

529
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:59,740
move forward I could possibly try to

530
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,750
pick it up and that's right yeah we can

531
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,390
set it in there and pull try to pull

532
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,400
tarp yeah we're like do you like I put

533
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:08,560
it in there and slowly pour it lift it

534
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,509
up so it slowly funnels in to people

535
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,289
grab this side to people in the back and

536
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:16,390
it will be good cascade in and then we

537
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:19,049
go to the path pulls in there and use

538
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:21,850
the bloom as like a topper when we can

539
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:23,230
so what's that this is our granule I'm

540
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:27,929
just gonna put a little bit in here so

541
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,930
we don't have to go through opening it

542
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:34,470
it's basically our dry soluble

543
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:38,619
fertilizer just prill with a with a bent

544
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:41,319
bentonite clay yeah so it's a like a

545
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:43,569
slow-release form of our fertilizers we

546
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:49,569
just do a little uh a little dab down in

547
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:52,689
the root zone no this is actually our

548
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:56,259
granular fertilizer so I was just

549
00:25:52,690 --> 00:26:06,309
putting a little bit in a bowl so when

550
00:25:56,259 --> 00:26:07,390
we give it the give it our it is it is

551
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:10,659
organic

552
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:13,600
we don't use any polymers or binders of

553
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,700
any sort within within the material and

554
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,139
it's the same derivative as our dry

555
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,900
soluble so it's derived from the

556
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,810
microbial fermentation by-product which

557
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:25,480
is basically a bacterial a bacterial

558
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:29,319
process and then we have it print

559
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,420
so it is a slow-release formula and here

560
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:33,429
we have different granular sizes as well

561
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,019
the small ones will obviously break up a

562
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,360
little bit faster while the larger ones

563
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:39,670
will take a little longer diet digest so

564
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,729
this gives you a nice you know three to

565
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,980
four week slow release of our great of

566
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:48,028
our nitrogen granular

567
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:52,409
the five to two so that's a basically a

568
00:26:48,028 --> 00:26:55,440
slow release nitrogen dominant correct

569
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:57,980
and then as once your plant moves into

570
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,860
flower we're going to leave behind our

571
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:03,720
granular PK as well so all it takes is

572
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:05,668
just a little about a gram a couple

573
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,519
grams per plant around the base and

574
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:11,610
continue watering and it'll give you a

575
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:14,278
continuous slow release grande PK and

576
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:17,339
then we also have in the granular form

577
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:19,259
our k formula the zero to five this is

578
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:21,418
good to finish with so you can write at

579
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:23,220
flower hit it with the granular and then

580
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:25,288
for your final two to three weeks of

581
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,389
finish get the K get a little bit of K

582
00:27:25,288 --> 00:27:29,638
on there for a boost they'll really help

583
00:27:27,388 --> 00:27:32,819
hard and harden up those those flowers

584
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:35,250
and push the pusher bulk in your density

585
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:37,528
and your weight in the end far as your

586
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,750
amount are you kind of eyeballing it for

587
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:42,179
this much soil yeah really

588
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:44,159
about a gram per plant on transplant is

589
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,730
about all you really need not too much

590
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,940
it's very efficient because our

591
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:54,179
fertilizer that has no salt it's

592
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:58,139
actually a carbon chain that the

593
00:27:54,179 --> 00:28:00,179
nutrients are are suspended on and so it

594
00:27:58,138 --> 00:28:02,519
does not get become leached out of the

595
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,919
soil or to have to go through any other

596
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,349
chelation process it's already available

597
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,750
for the nutrient and the carbon helps it

598
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:12,719
to suspend and stay in the soil and not

599
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:16,528
become just part of the grass fertilizer

600
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:20,630
for you and all right so now we'll bring

601
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,630
over the soil and bring it in

602
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:43,460
mush earlier one of pull tight pulling

603
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:43,460
right over and then we'll push yes

604
00:28:49,789 --> 00:29:15,690
something tells me that it's gonna be no

605
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:21,840
shovel methods when you show up to a

606
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:24,299
grill without a shovel the cardboard is

607
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,279
recyclable we could actually put a layer

608
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:29,369
of cardboard down at the bottom help any

609
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:36,940
grass pressure from coming in but that's

610
00:29:29,369 --> 00:30:02,209
a always improvements

611
00:29:36,940 --> 00:30:11,250
[Music]

612
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:19,590
yeah hmm now we just slip her out get

613
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:26,490
the all right

614
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:37,230
beautiful perfect calculation buyer

615
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:38,259
there's good job Wow do you think you

616
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:41,569
guys have done this before

617
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:44,609
[Laughter]

618
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:46,919
notice this what is this like with the

619
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:49,379
waters gonna go in Willy sit down oh

620
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:52,080
yeah that's right and this is so this is

621
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,370
just what you're looking for exactly and

622
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,589
the good thing about what grass roots

623
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:58,469
has done is that you can see the stitch

624
00:30:55,589 --> 00:31:01,709
there we were looking at before was uh

625
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,839
they've added this so you can you can be

626
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:06,000
more consistent but you don't get soggy

627
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,179
down here so they really thought that

628
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,180
through

629
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,259
[Music]

630
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:29,210
oh it's a beautiful pen time Wow that's

631
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:34,609
gonna grill for his mom really healthy

632
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:37,850
plants for you and give it a little

633
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:39,469
press down compaction not too much not

634
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:41,619
too little well give him one more week

635
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:44,200
and Eric and I would making 64 of these

636
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:49,399
[Laughter]

637
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:51,110
Thank You grassroots we're doing hemp

638
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,269
this year yeah we're doing hemp this

639
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:55,429
year down in San Diego we did we had a

640
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:57,259
protest plot last year worked with some

641
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,910
different genetics and and found the

642
00:31:57,259 --> 00:32:00,819
best eye works for our area down in San

643
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:05,690
Diego so this year we're doing 10 acres

644
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:09,859
yeah CBG CBD and yeah something we're

645
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:12,049
super proud of and what uh what genetics

646
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:15,559
did you settle on like what were some of

647
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:18,169
the kind of bleeders whose seeds you

648
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:20,929
were trying out and then you know we

649
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,039
found just do some of our trials last

650
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:25,580
year I mean right this year you've

651
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:27,230
definitely have a a burst of other seeds

652
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:28,699
that have come out in the market and

653
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:31,400
we'll certainly test those but given

654
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,539
last year we we chose to go with HGH

655
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:37,340
high-grade hemp we've got some great

656
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:40,609
CBG matterhorn and then they're cherry

657
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:45,349
wine is is great also you know we tested

658
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:48,049
a 14.4 so it's definitely a and out of a

659
00:32:45,349 --> 00:32:50,419
thousand plants we found not one male so

660
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:52,099
the feminized process is they've got a

661
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:55,539
got a doing they're doing a great job

662
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:57,829
there so but we're looking forward to

663
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:59,690
trying all sorts of different seeds in

664
00:32:57,829 --> 00:33:01,429
the coming in the coming year because

665
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,870
there's a lot of great companies I've

666
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,299
been working hard on putting genetics

667
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:11,029
together so we're kind of excited where

668
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:13,190
that's going well we we have a farm so

669
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:14,750
we've been doing some seed testing yeah

670
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:18,200
we've been doing you know we spent the

671
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:20,690
last 18 19 months doing C testing when

672
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,519
people bring their seeds to you to test

673
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:26,509
them see how they're doing in the soil

674
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:28,460
is that like do they go bit on the down

675
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:33,200
low like that's our information

676
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:36,230
is it is that I would you know some you

677
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:42,470
know depending on how new the seat is

678
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:44,360
that they're bringing to us or we're not

679
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,879
allowed to we don't use them as a breed

680
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:48,498
stock so we don't seed Argentina so

681
00:33:46,878 --> 00:33:51,740
we're not taking other breeder seeds and

682
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:56,058
creating a service for them but you're

683
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:57,798
also learning exactly elevate so you

684
00:33:56,058 --> 00:33:59,538
would prove your product through that

685
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:01,398
process yeah definitely definitely

686
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:03,408
because other breeders are always

687
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:06,378
improving that allows the growers to

688
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:08,148
improve and so it really is a it really

689
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,949
is a friendship that has to take place

690
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:12,469
between growers and breeders I guess my

691
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:14,719
question is as genetics changed and our

692
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:18,168
knowledge and especially in cannabis

693
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,689
well will the soil change with it I mean

694
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:22,848
will the environment I think as of right

695
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,230
now the balance of biology and the soil

696
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:26,809
food web is always going to be the

697
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:28,579
consistent part of anything that's that

698
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:30,589
the process of either genetics or

699
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:33,889
growing or breeding and I think that

700
00:34:30,588 --> 00:34:36,318
actually you can using using a soil food

701
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:36,980
web and the balance of biology and high

702
00:34:36,318 --> 00:34:39,829
diversity

703
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:42,829
you can probably enhance and accentuate

704
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:45,530
some of the genetic maximum that plants

705
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:47,510
have so we feel you know if you have a

706
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:50,298
well-rounded soil you can definitely

707
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:53,359
produce a better quality seed growers

708
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:58,759
are always talking about realizing the

709
00:34:53,358 --> 00:35:01,098
fullest expression we've had many

710
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,500
compliments that allow our products

711
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,390
really enhance the terpene profile the

712
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:09,170
flavors the stickiness the resin that's

713
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:10,759
why going that's that's the Holy Grail

714
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,200
yeah you know the kind that's gonna

715
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,210
stick to the window when you throw at it

716
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:16,879
and that breaks the windows I throw at

717
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:19,880
it you know so basically what do we want

718
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,420
to plant so we got a four by four you

719
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,130
want to do two three you know obviously

720
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:27,200
we if you want to save what we have I

721
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:32,440
think we had an odd number if you want

722
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:32,439
to take a four there

723
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:38,619
if nine well we have for autos so I

724
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:41,739
thought we could put the autos

725
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:44,409
separately just in small pots yeah no

726
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:46,179
that's a great idea yeah and you could

727
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:48,730
put four you can put the rest of them in

728
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:51,609
here and there's a good possibility one

729
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:55,349
or two might be mail and you pull those

730
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,349
out and remain with like three or four

731
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,870
we're not putting autos in that okay

732
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:13,600
yeah autos like less stress that's the

733
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,579
key to autos is you really have to go

734
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,250
you have to find a place for the seed

735
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:19,719
and have it settle and that's really

736
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:22,210
going to be the best case but people are

737
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:25,329
getting better at auto so you know we're

738
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:30,460
encouraged alright so we basically want

739
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:32,769
to put four in there right now your

740
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,500
healthy number one on each quadrant not

741
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:38,110
assuming that fifty percent maybe male

742
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,690
yeah let's start with four that way the

743
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:47,950
one in the middle you know it doesn't

744
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:49,720
get choked out if they all take off all

745
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:51,669
right

746
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:55,209
so you got your before I'm gonna leave

747
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:57,369
it up to you guys you guys are not

748
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:00,159
evenly sure that each route gets equal

749
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:04,119
opportunity within the within the space

750
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:07,569
provided so section it out into a little

751
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:10,410
quadrants get our cups going how does

752
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:13,150
that look fairly straight to everyone

753
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:18,179
alright that gives them all an

754
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:18,180
opportunity to to grow in and grow out I

755
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:30,849
don't want this to fall over and we're

756
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:35,289
just going to take a little soil out in

757
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:37,330
preparation for our hole and these are

758
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:40,539
nice small cups so we don't need very

759
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:42,940
much and being that there's not much

760
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:45,070
root mass in there as well we want to be

761
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:48,849
real careful on the transplant right we

762
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:57,130
don't just drop everything out so it'll

763
00:37:48,849 --> 00:38:01,690
be more of a scoop and hold I mean these

764
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:05,108
are yes we do these are the Pacific

765
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:08,200
Northwest routes great so rascai

766
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:16,440
appalled sent a whole lot of these down

767
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:27,250
into its Harlequin crossed with alien

768
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:28,059
something my sense the Harlequin is

769
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,099
high-cbd

770
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:32,230
yeah it's gonna be and then that I would

771
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,700
assume the other one is a high THC so

772
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,380
it's kind of like a down the middle

773
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:40,710
that's perfect blend those two together

774
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,710
and a lots of terpenes of flavor yeah

775
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,150
one of my favorite things to do is to

776
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,000
add a little extra love right at the

777
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:51,369
root zone upon transplant we have one

778
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,980
bag left it's our bloom usually I'd be

779
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:56,588
using the premium mix but the bloom is

780
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,838
is great as well to use in any manner

781
00:38:56,588 --> 00:39:02,039
this has a little bit of soft rock

782
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:05,400
phosphate in there so instead of

783
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:07,409
our fossilized kelp and volcanic rock

784
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,940
mineral or sorry fossilized kelp we add

785
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:14,909
the soft rock phosphate as well as a

786
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,280
little more fungal dominant compost you

787
00:39:14,909 --> 00:39:20,730
can see how fine this material is as

788
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,340
well it's a very very good well

789
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:26,610
broken-down compost material screened

790
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:29,550
down to 1/8 of an inch and then so

791
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,900
really just literally just a dusting is

792
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:35,670
all it really is gonna take right at

793
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:37,730
that root zone not much at all you know

794
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:40,800
for me it's a little concentration of

795
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:43,110
biology and and mineral and love right

796
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,330
at the transplant zone right where the

797
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:48,150
main actions gonna be taking place right

798
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:50,759
away for for uh I might be as a

799
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,660
stimulant this just stimulate that yeah

800
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,200
exactly

801
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:56,759
little a little buffer between the roots

802
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,739
that are about to grow out in the soil

803
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,110
that there be no place to yeah nice and

804
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:03,299
what I'm gonna do as well is add just

805
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:06,870
literally like we said that little gram

806
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:09,539
of of our slow release I mean it's

807
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:11,849
literally just a couple a couple little

808
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:18,360
granulars that's gonna allow the roots

809
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:20,250
and Emeril who does like the band and

810
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,440
you know you really once again this

811
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,610
won't burn the plants cuz it's not salt

812
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,470
based so you don't have to worry about

813
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,300
that root coming into contact in it

814
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:29,129
potentially burning because it is

815
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,740
carbon-based and it's an all organic

816
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:35,490
coloring as well it may look like a

817
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:37,289
chemical though it is not yeah that's

818
00:40:35,489 --> 00:40:39,479
what I was getting at before cuz it

819
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:42,989
looks like Miracle Grow but obviously

820
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,300
it's okay now we have our nice and then

821
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:47,729
maybe one little final swirl at the

822
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:51,900
bottom to give it that final little

823
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:58,110
bottom of the whole love and spread

824
00:40:51,900 --> 00:41:00,389
everything up and my you you know who is

825
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:02,280
I'll try one you try one you try one

826
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:05,670
that way if someone fails it's on

827
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:09,600
someone else err I don't know now I've

828
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:11,849
sensitive you know it's it's uh usually

829
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,069
what what we could do is you could take

830
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:14,949
just some a scissor and kind of slice

831
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,690
down the cut

832
00:41:14,949 --> 00:41:18,639
kind of open it and then we can that's

833
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,579
way we can observe the route and kind of

834
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:23,769
determine how we want to grab something

835
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:26,769
this size sometimes it's nice to go a

836
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:28,420
little bit for a bigger on the size that

837
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:31,809
will help establish more root mass kind

838
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:34,420
of kind of put things together so

839
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:37,380
definitely but we'll you know we we can

840
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:43,710
manage that's what growing is adapting

841
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:48,160
right bless you

842
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:50,588
should I continue so basically just kind

843
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,779
of making sure I'm squeezing out a

844
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:55,088
little bit not not affecting any kind of

845
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:57,339
route that might occur and you can kind

846
00:41:55,088 --> 00:41:59,078
of sell just just just as we just as we

847
00:41:57,338 --> 00:42:02,320
thought you know so you don't have a

848
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:03,849
giant root zone so what we're gonna do

849
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,280
is we know we're not going to affect too

850
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:07,660
much on the bottom there so I would I

851
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:13,930
would probably just give it a little bit

852
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:15,848
of a side slice to and you know the

853
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:18,489
beauty of what Eric just did is in

854
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:20,260
putting castings on the ground is that

855
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:22,809
even if this does have a little bit of

856
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:25,480
shock you know the biology once you

857
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:27,130
water that that biology goes free and it

858
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,068
starts attaching to the to the root zone

859
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:32,260
you're really gonna find that the plant

860
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:35,019
even if stress would bounce back very

861
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,849
quickly actually to maybe not even the

862
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:39,489
trained eye you probably wouldn't even

863
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:43,920
realize the stress that it would so I

864
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:43,919
would just you know kind of take that

865
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,740
just make sure we are handling because

866
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,960
what happens is that top routes gonna be

867
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:58,809
at the bottom regardless so you just

868
00:42:52,960 --> 00:43:00,130
want to make sure yeah there you go want

869
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:02,619
to set it in and then kind of

870
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:04,750
recalibrate holder up a little bit and

871
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:06,670
we know we got a little sprinkle on the

872
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:11,650
bottom so my hand is still in contact

873
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:13,300
with the the biology there making sure

874
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:15,608
that the bottom of this top root is

875
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:21,220
effectively going to be hitting and then

876
00:43:15,608 --> 00:43:22,929
we'll just do is release and and then

877
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:25,539
this is up to the grower to kind of

878
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:28,328
manage this process just a little bit is

879
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:28,809
you want to bury it so you know if if

880
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:30,490
that you

881
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:32,739
if you planted a little too deep or too

882
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:35,889
little to shower you shallow you still

883
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:39,399
have time to kind of adjust maybe lean

884
00:43:35,889 --> 00:43:42,699
it over and you don't want to strangle

885
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,769
it and would have an ideal amount of

886
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:46,149
stock do you want to see yeah definitely

887
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:49,030
so you see the color starts to change

888
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:51,099
towards the bottom it's wider yeah so if

889
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:52,570
some strands will be darker some strands

890
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:53,889
will be lighter but that's kind of the

891
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:55,660
indication of where it was coming out

892
00:43:53,889 --> 00:43:57,069
from the seed and so you want to be

893
00:43:55,659 --> 00:43:59,589
around that zone you don't want to be

894
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:01,360
too far up or too far low but you can

895
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:03,550
tell if you look real close you can kind

896
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,650
of see some hair development there so

897
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:09,100
we'll do is we'll just kind of observe

898
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:10,450
that a little bit and just look at these

899
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:12,759
are babies so we want to treat them as

900
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:14,409
babies too you know so really easy on

901
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,000
everything that's that's done kind of

902
00:44:14,409 --> 00:44:18,219
move things away give it some breathing

903
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,829
room and this way when you water things

904
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:25,209
don't rush in and and and bury it again

905
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:30,639
so just like that and then we'll do is

906
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:34,840
uh there you go okay so we've added some

907
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:39,039
FPF fpf is a fulvic acid folic acid is a

908
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:41,470
great stimulant it def this one has

909
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:44,409
amino acids as well and it's really good

910
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:46,689
foliar it's it's a great soil drench but

911
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:53,109
fulvic acid amino acid simple and

912
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:57,880
complex sugars is there yes is a great

913
00:44:53,110 --> 00:45:00,099
addition it doesn't take much for this

914
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,440
fulvic acid to take effect it's one

915
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:06,069
milliliter per gallon this being

916
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,599
probably less than a pint I'm literally

917
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,920
gonna and we don't want to stress out

918
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,219
I'm going to take the tip of this thing

919
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,740
get it on there it's really it's it's it

920
00:45:12,219 --> 00:45:16,719
has a nice consistency viscosity but

921
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:18,609
it's a hundred percent soluble it will

922
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,799
become a full part of the water right

923
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:28,570
away and so that's really literally a

924
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:30,190
drop is awesome shaken not yet I'm gonna

925
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:32,620
add a little bit of water and then I'm

926
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:35,530
figuring that that circulation is going

927
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:37,989
to there's a little bit of a shake but

928
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:38,380
it but it but uh but it doesn't separate

929
00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:41,139
okay

930
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,670
so it's just to almost out of habit in a

931
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:48,119
sense but yeah a nice shake is

932
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:52,240
never hurts all right so we have our

933
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:55,329
nutrient filled water and we're ready to

934
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,859
give it a little now once again you

935
00:45:55,329 --> 00:46:00,730
don't want to water right on top of it

936
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:06,550
because you could possibly damage it so

937
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:09,130
we're just gonna get it right around but

938
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:11,080
that's a generous amount I mean it is

939
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:13,269
it's in there like it's brand-new in

940
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:17,139
there definitely and and and the thing

941
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:19,059
about the the seed and and cuts is you

942
00:46:17,139 --> 00:46:21,579
don't really need to just take a hose

943
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:24,909
and water this whole thing down the goal

944
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:28,659
is to again let let the roots know that

945
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:31,599
that it has water you want to activate

946
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:33,519
the biology that's that's a surrounding

947
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,339
root and then you want to water enough

948
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:38,619
where there the water goes just to pass

949
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:41,470
through just pass the root so that when

950
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:43,480
it begins to dry out the root is going

951
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:45,459
to it's gonna signal it to stretch and

952
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,110
try to look for water and so that's

953
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:49,090
really the the case here so honestly

954
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:51,730
that's how much water you need but again

955
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:53,140
like babies you need to just kind of

956
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:54,400
come out especially in hot weather you

957
00:46:53,139 --> 00:46:56,289
come out and just double check on them

958
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,820
and maybe in a hundred and five degrees

959
00:46:56,289 --> 00:47:00,250
it's a possibility you might have to

960
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,539
water twice that day now we're normally

961
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,340
not getting up

962
00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:06,400
let's talk temperature for a minute

963
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:08,680
because sometimes they catch up triple

964
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,380
digits here in the middle of the San

965
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:15,039
Fernando Valley but you but like usually

966
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:18,730
it's like 90s like high 90 so what's the

967
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:21,389
difference between 103 and 95 or yeah

968
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:25,090
like like when are they really sweating

969
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:26,829
what do you think they really is

970
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,269
genetics on that a lot you know you have

971
00:47:26,829 --> 00:47:29,829
genetics that are more tailored to hot

972
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:32,019
drier climates and ones that are more

973
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:33,819
tropical so I would go into that part to

974
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:36,250
know your your zone know your time its

975
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,900
how and then we actually have a product

976
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,670
that helps you with that it's our

977
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:42,519
fermented castor bean and what this

978
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:45,220
actually is as a foliar spray it helps

979
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:47,679
by going onto the the cell yo cells on

980
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:49,419
the leaf surface and diffusing the UV as

981
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:52,000
it penetrates the cells so there's less

982
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,889
intercellular heating on the leaf

983
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,048
surface and then that allows the cell to

984
00:47:53,889 --> 00:47:58,808
continue growing chlorophyll stay

985
00:47:56,048 --> 00:48:02,318
turgid not become heat stress so this is

986
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:05,469
actually a more heat stress maximize

987
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:07,239
light efficiency and what time of day

988
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:08,798
you spraying that would recommend in the

989
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:13,059
morning just like early morning yeah

990
00:48:08,798 --> 00:48:14,679
just into practice you go up until

991
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:17,289
flowered up until you see pistol

992
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:19,568
development yeah once a week every other

993
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:22,390
week is it good is it a miss you miss

994
00:48:19,568 --> 00:48:24,248
correct yep nice mister sprayer and then

995
00:48:22,389 --> 00:48:26,679
we will we will set you up with all the

996
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:28,899
yeah the two of the gardening tools you

997
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:31,119
need everything right so that's what

998
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,519
that does then can you talk so and but

999
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,979
you wouldn't start that now no Creek you

1000
00:48:33,518 --> 00:48:39,188
start that in like a month it's it's

1001
00:48:35,978 --> 00:48:40,688
grown and and for 95 to 100 to three you

1002
00:48:39,188 --> 00:48:43,058
know it just depends because it could be

1003
00:48:40,688 --> 00:48:45,308
a 95 and very humid you know it could be

1004
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:47,019
95 and dry so you know that and then

1005
00:48:45,309 --> 00:48:48,880
there's if you add wind if you take out

1006
00:48:47,018 --> 00:48:51,159
wind so there's a lot of elements but

1007
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,380
that's not like right now so right now I

1008
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:55,058
you know you probably would be okay at

1009
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,829
this point until tomorrow morning

1010
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:59,798
and you would come out and you would

1011
00:48:56,829 --> 00:49:01,929
look at it but your finger down in the

1012
00:48:59,798 --> 00:49:04,449
zone see how deep your water is you say

1013
00:49:01,929 --> 00:49:06,910
okay I have plenty of water my roots

1014
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:09,278
haven't migrated beyond here yet perhaps

1015
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:11,199
it's looking for water and you know wait

1016
00:49:09,278 --> 00:49:13,239
for this top to dry out a little bit and

1017
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:15,749
then you then you know and we want to

1018
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:19,269
continue feeding it with this mixture

1019
00:49:15,748 --> 00:49:22,238
every every time you you water so the

1020
00:49:19,268 --> 00:49:23,828
first mixture will be fpf you know the

1021
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:26,499
second mixture you can add a little

1022
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:28,749
humic acid and then the the third

1023
00:49:26,498 --> 00:49:32,379
mixture as they start to as they start

1024
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:35,018
to feed you can use the dry soluble high

1025
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:37,929
nitrogen sources but you know generally

1026
00:49:35,018 --> 00:49:40,389
for this type of soil and this type of

1027
00:49:37,929 --> 00:49:43,929
blend with the worm castings that we

1028
00:49:40,389 --> 00:49:45,998
added you really only need plain water

1029
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:48,489
yeah it's not gonna yeah you know for

1030
00:49:45,998 --> 00:49:51,068
the until until the plants really start

1031
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:52,420
to develop start eating and needing a

1032
00:49:51,068 --> 00:49:54,548
little bit more you can start to get

1033
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,528
into the regimen but yeah because Eric

1034
00:49:54,548 --> 00:49:58,059
put the granulars in there and a little

1035
00:49:56,528 --> 00:49:59,708
dust of worm castings you're gonna get

1036
00:49:58,059 --> 00:50:02,109
everything that plant needs for at least

1037
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:03,938
the first week or so yeah and then the

1038
00:50:02,108 --> 00:50:07,058
only reason you would add a little FPF

1039
00:50:03,938 --> 00:50:09,308
to the mixture is if your pH may be high

1040
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:09,940
on the water you're using it helps to

1041
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:11,619
bring it

1042
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:14,230
bring that down a little bit so just

1043
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:17,019
just a touch which what's generally the

1044
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:18,909
the canvas plants like that so

1045
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:22,469
essentially should we get the other here

1046
00:50:18,909 --> 00:50:22,469
in there get the other three in there

1047
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:28,440
cutting poor technique yeah I guess that

1048
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,440
might be there

1049
00:50:30,389 --> 00:50:35,730
they're pretty there's not much route

1050
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,730
anyway so

1051
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:47,059
this one got a little more moist

1052
00:50:52,699 --> 00:51:00,478
look at the gentle touch and the great

1053
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:04,259
thing about this plant is that it reacts

1054
00:51:00,478 --> 00:51:06,419
so quickly and then you can react quick

1055
00:51:04,259 --> 00:51:08,309
enough and help it actually there's a

1056
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:14,729
little tap root already coming down in

1057
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:17,009
the bottom of this baby yeah that's

1058
00:51:14,728 --> 00:51:21,328
actually faster I only put those in the

1059
00:51:17,009 --> 00:51:25,639
dirt seven days ago nice I mean

1060
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:29,869
literally it was a it had just popped

1061
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:32,969
jiminee you just put glue down my back

1062
00:51:29,869 --> 00:51:34,670
yeah it's not too hot you know it's only

1063
00:51:32,969 --> 00:51:36,749
hot cuz we're doing a little gardening

1064
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:39,318
yeah I mean when I was growing in

1065
00:51:36,748 --> 00:51:42,598
Topanga we're getting the hundreds and

1066
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:45,088
it was only really like in the second

1067
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:47,940
third of growth that they just wanted

1068
00:51:45,088 --> 00:51:51,599
water yeah like now you you water them

1069
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:53,190
every couple days yeah definitely yeah

1070
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,880
and that's that's a thing just kind of

1071
00:51:53,190 --> 00:52:00,719
have to watch the plant and it really is

1072
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,219
a process you just got to be cognizant

1073
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:05,670
of what you're doing and take care of

1074
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:10,650
the babies until they're I did do the

1075
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:12,059
slice yes and then just sort of I think

1076
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:21,048
that little bit of them don't fuck it up

1077
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:21,048
Tom I was telling myself that

1078
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:31,179
you want to water the next one yeah yeah

1079
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:33,710
definitely

1080
00:52:31,179 --> 00:52:36,609
okay Gemma how about right here but not

1081
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:40,760
on the leaves but around the leaves

1082
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:41,990
perfect oh good job perfect rule thank

1083
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:51,619
this one could probably use one more

1084
00:52:41,989 --> 00:52:57,549
little drink to it over there too thank

1085
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:57,550
you you're the best helper

1086
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:10,840
great so much we're using the solo cabs

1087
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:14,870
solo you solo I always feel like next

1088
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:17,000
time I want to let them go longer so

1089
00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:20,329
that they have like the mass and you can

1090
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,010
just pop them out but you know that tap

1091
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:25,069
roots really gonna like being in here so

1092
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:28,750
it's it's a win-win either way you got

1093
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:28,750
to wait from the put the plants in

1094
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:52,730
upside down and let no no Jemma not yet

1095
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:55,069
okay you got a little patience okay

1096
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:58,130
around the leaves not on the leaves

1097
00:53:55,070 --> 00:54:02,680
because you're looking good that's

1098
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:04,130
beautiful and Gemma why don't you do it

1099
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:10,069
that's right

1100
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:15,410
Yeah right around little circles amazing

1101
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:17,660
okay perfect and then let it wait okay

1102
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:19,389
you wanna do one more very consistency

1103
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:23,049
on this one do it again

1104
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:23,049
all right go for it

1105
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:31,329
here you're up okay all right so we're

1106
00:54:28,748 --> 00:54:32,588
gonna pants match the bag of bloom yes

1107
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:35,019
in your shirt too

1108
00:54:32,588 --> 00:54:38,639
you're the same color as our batters are

1109
00:54:35,018 --> 00:54:38,639
the bag of worm Catherine next to you

1110
00:54:49,679 --> 00:55:02,969
how are you with the scissors should I

1111
00:54:53,559 --> 00:55:02,970
trust you yet master

1112
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:13,820
oh very nice that might have been the

1113
00:55:10,909 --> 00:55:16,940
best one yet okay a little better can

1114
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:18,530
you play Gemma can you push yeah you

1115
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,269
want to push some dirt in here I'll hold

1116
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:21,530
this

1117
00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:23,809
you know another note just to add to

1118
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:29,630
this - no no not on it sometimes I like

1119
00:55:23,809 --> 00:55:31,099
to use a micro rising today but there's

1120
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,570
some great companies that make some

1121
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:34,549
really good mycorrhizae and that's

1122
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:39,109
definitely something that you'd want to

1123
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:40,490
look into it's just different different

1124
00:55:39,108 --> 00:55:43,039
fungi that attach themselves to the

1125
00:55:40,489 --> 00:55:44,959
roots and start to start yeah even at

1126
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:47,480
this stage it's it's a it's great it you

1127
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,519
know they remember not on it'll help to

1128
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:52,179
increase the root mass it'll help bring

1129
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:55,159
nutrients help fight off disease

1130
00:55:52,179 --> 00:55:57,230
mycorrhizae is a great addition - yeah

1131
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:59,659
so we'll get that time and then we'll I

1132
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:00,289
mean so now you just what like sprinkle

1133
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:03,199
it all right yeah

1134
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:14,239
even now even there Sal you boys - you

1135
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:17,589
could put in the penetration and so talk

1136
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:20,629
about kind of your common la tap water

1137
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:24,800
that's not really a problem at I mean

1138
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:27,230
yeah you know tap water is you know it's

1139
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,789
it varies very much from where you are I

1140
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:31,159
mean there's different there will be

1141
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:33,679
different mineral content in there

1142
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:36,618
there'll be different ECEs in there so

1143
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:38,829
you you you want to be cognizant if

1144
00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:41,269
you're if you're gardening at this stage

1145
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:44,599
if you're gardening at this stage you're

1146
00:56:41,269 --> 00:56:47,030
there's there's in the end you have

1147
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:48,618
beneficial biology there's a good chance

1148
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:50,900
that with the addition of humic with

1149
00:56:48,619 --> 00:56:53,180
addition of fulvic you'll be able to

1150
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:55,760
minimize some of the chlorines and

1151
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:57,949
chloramines that are in the water but

1152
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:01,790
generally if you you know if you can get

1153
00:56:57,949 --> 00:57:04,159
one of those hose and just attachments

1154
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:06,199
with the carbon filter and just remove

1155
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:07,159
some of the chlorine that's gonna be

1156
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:09,439
really helpful

1157
00:57:07,159 --> 00:57:11,358
there's obviously you know ro units that

1158
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,769
you know they'll be waste water and you

1159
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:15,799
know depends on the sophistication of

1160
00:57:12,769 --> 00:57:16,969
your grow but generally for a garden

1161
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,890
like this you know just a little hose

1162
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:19,788
end well you know we just got a five

1163
00:57:18,889 --> 00:57:22,818
gallon

1164
00:57:19,789 --> 00:57:24,289
pale and just let it sit overnight that

1165
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:29,298
would help too yeah that would help too

1166
00:57:24,289 --> 00:57:30,589
in yeah you know those are really you

1167
00:57:29,298 --> 00:57:31,909
know you can buy those for anywhere from

1168
00:57:30,588 --> 00:57:34,429
twelve ninety nine to nineteen ninety

1169
00:57:31,909 --> 00:57:36,199
nine and there yeah and there's yeah

1170
00:57:34,429 --> 00:57:37,999
those will have it online they'll ship

1171
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:39,889
go online your your hide your store

1172
00:57:37,998 --> 00:57:41,688
should have a good one yeah depending on

1173
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:43,429
the density of the carbon that they pack

1174
00:57:41,688 --> 00:57:46,009
is how many gallons you can fill through

1175
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:48,979
value some do like ten thousand some do

1176
00:57:46,009 --> 00:57:51,349
30,000 gallons it's helped strip you

1177
00:57:48,978 --> 00:57:52,578
know a little bit of that just because

1178
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:54,409
we're going to be sensitive of our

1179
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:55,969
biology and those chlorines and

1180
00:57:54,409 --> 00:57:58,189
chloramines are designed in the water to

1181
00:57:55,969 --> 00:58:00,108
kill any bacteria so of course when it

1182
00:57:58,188 --> 00:58:02,808
you know goes into the under our soil

1183
00:58:00,108 --> 00:58:05,828
there's potential for it to do harm but

1184
00:58:02,809 --> 00:58:09,048
we have a practice of continuing to add

1185
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:23,539
microorganisms through our bio packs and

1186
00:58:09,048 --> 00:58:26,659
by this guy was made for teller Sunday

1187
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:29,659
morning infomercial will allow us to

1188
00:58:26,659 --> 00:58:31,459
brew up our consistent microorganism

1189
00:58:29,659 --> 00:58:33,409
microbial rich solution so we can

1190
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:35,268
continue to apply beneficial biology

1191
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:37,969
throughout the growing season comes

1192
00:58:35,268 --> 00:58:40,218
ready to go out of the box grab our bio

1193
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:42,019
pack so this is where you would want to

1194
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:43,219
use the non-chlorinated water that's

1195
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,198
kind of why I brought this up while we

1196
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:48,349
were talking about the water issue when

1197
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:50,479
you're brewing biology you use RO water

1198
00:58:48,349 --> 00:58:52,039
use well water use something that's not

1199
00:58:50,478 --> 00:58:53,658
going to have any chlorine or chlorine

1200
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:55,309
in it cuz that will inhibit your

1201
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:57,679
multiplication that we're trying to

1202
00:58:55,309 --> 00:58:58,999
gather in here in your biology once it's

1203
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:00,619
in the bed you have a lot of food

1204
00:58:58,998 --> 00:59:01,968
sources and other organic matter and

1205
00:59:00,619 --> 00:59:04,039
carbon that'll help

1206
00:59:01,969 --> 00:59:05,778
strip some of that chlorine and affect

1207
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:08,479
the way when you water consistently so

1208
00:59:05,778 --> 00:59:10,130
if you're watering with a hose city

1209
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:11,778
water it's not a big deal as long as

1210
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:13,249
you're brewing up your biology very well

1211
00:59:11,778 --> 00:59:16,639
so inside of this pack has all the

1212
00:59:13,248 --> 00:59:19,278
ingredients slided put it inside of the

1213
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:21,679
bio extractor brew it up for 24 hours

1214
00:59:19,278 --> 00:59:24,099
after you pre activate it and you get

1215
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:26,358
your plethora of 30,000 different

1216
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:28,369
microorganisms your balance of biology

1217
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:30,048
and continue to feed your plants with it

1218
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:32,088
throughout the globe what do you mean by

1219
00:59:30,048 --> 00:59:33,369
after you pre activate it so what's the

1220
00:59:32,088 --> 00:59:37,219
pre activation

1221
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:39,019
sure I will we take this put a simple

1222
00:59:37,219 --> 00:59:41,209
cereal bowl or something like that and

1223
00:59:39,019 --> 00:59:43,820
this one takes about a quarter cup of

1224
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:45,530
water and pour it over and what it's

1225
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:47,660
going to do is absorb into the end of

1226
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:49,580
the mix kit and then that moisture

1227
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:51,730
allows some of that slower developing

1228
00:59:49,579 --> 00:59:54,980
biology to start breaking down the carbs

1229
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:58,190
the complex carbs and it grows more the

1230
00:59:54,980 --> 01:00:03,980
fungal and in our slow eaters and then

1231
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:06,920
we have a packet of basically blackstrap

1232
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:08,539
molasses and this goes is as our sugars

1233
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,610
which help feed the bacteria very

1234
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:12,860
quickly so there are sixteen different

1235
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:14,960
ingredients that go into our mix in here

1236
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:18,370
and these are also certified organic

1237
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,369
California Department of Food and

1238
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:23,659
Agriculture anything like that in here

1239
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:27,259
no chemical fertilizers this is a pure

1240
01:00:23,659 --> 01:00:29,389
organic pack and then then you allow

1241
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:31,460
that solution to brew for 24 hours your

1242
01:00:29,389 --> 01:00:33,529
multiplication of biology occurs within

1243
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:35,929
that time and this is what it's bigger

1244
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:37,700
than a five gallon we call this the four

1245
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:39,349
gallon sergeant four gal correct you

1246
01:00:37,699 --> 01:00:41,059
fill it up to the four gallon line so

1247
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:44,000
when I start it is a five gallon kind of

1248
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:50,840
bucket size filled so we actually have a

1249
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:53,409
fist the way out okay and so this one

1250
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:57,400
packet basically once you mix it up

1251
01:00:53,409 --> 01:01:00,409
would you would you feed this whole bed

1252
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:03,650
over how long a period of time so you

1253
01:01:00,409 --> 01:01:05,029
brew it for 24 hours mm-hmm then you

1254
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:06,829
have your tea you want to use that tea

1255
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:08,630
the sooner you get it from the extractor

1256
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:11,119
into your medium the better because

1257
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:13,460
you've packed so much biology in here

1258
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,679
and there's an air pump inside of this

1259
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:16,849
lid and this is an air diffuser so when

1260
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:18,799
it's on what you're doing is you're

1261
01:01:16,849 --> 01:01:21,170
oxygenating the water creating an

1262
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,820
aerobic living environment with the

1263
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:24,320
beneficial microbes and all the food

1264
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:26,240
sources so they have oxygen to breathe

1265
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:28,880
water to live in and food to eat they

1266
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:30,679
multiply through that process and then

1267
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,200
that material gets you could either

1268
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:36,379
dilute it down one to ten one to twenty

1269
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:38,779
or this stuff is so pure if you've used

1270
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,690
it fresh you really if you don't dilute

1271
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:42,830
it you won't kill your plant either so

1272
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:45,950
but it has to be fresh if you're doing

1273
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:46,460
that and so so how long can the tea last

1274
01:01:45,949 --> 01:01:47,929
but

1275
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:50,300
or you just kind of need to dump it and

1276
01:01:47,929 --> 01:01:52,190
rinse it out and yeah you know of

1277
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,650
temperature there's a lot of variations

1278
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:55,880
in tea brewing that a lot of really I

1279
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:58,880
mean I'm sure they'll go over those

1280
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:01,400
segments in here but a general practice

1281
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,170
is I would say four hours six hours

1282
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,940
eight hours would be maximum if your

1283
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:07,608
don't want it to be in the Sun keep it

1284
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:09,740
in the cooler so once you brewed it for

1285
01:02:07,608 --> 01:02:11,960
24 hours you basically wanna I mean we

1286
01:02:09,739 --> 01:02:15,019
would and we could we could use all four

1287
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:17,179
gallons in one application in here I

1288
01:02:15,019 --> 01:02:20,659
would I mean you could potentially but

1289
01:02:17,179 --> 01:02:22,579
then you wouldn't be maximizing its you

1290
01:02:20,659 --> 01:02:25,940
know how what all I could do so I'd

1291
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:28,039
recommend a gallon a solution diluted

1292
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:29,869
into a five-gallon bucket go ahead and

1293
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:30,980
water this with one gallon solution then

1294
01:02:29,869 --> 01:02:33,050
hit all your other plants around the

1295
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:34,579
house with I got it so basically the

1296
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:37,160
grass I'm gonna spray with it as well

1297
01:02:34,579 --> 01:02:39,199
okay this is a fantastic to give

1298
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:41,868
everything a foliar spray with helps

1299
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:43,579
protect the leaf surfaces feed and that

1300
01:02:41,869 --> 01:02:45,440
you do wide it like seven I on the same

1301
01:02:43,579 --> 01:02:46,848
thing you know is there a point in the

1302
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,530
growth stage when you want to use your

1303
01:02:46,849 --> 01:02:53,300
tea or is it using it right away

1304
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:55,760
the sooner we can apply the biology the

1305
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,750
better it is for the plants definitely

1306
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,359
so we could do it today

1307
01:02:56,750 --> 01:03:01,070
yeah by tomorrow it's correct so we'll

1308
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:03,440
go ahead and pre if you have a cereal

1309
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:05,539
bowl and some non-chlorinated water we

1310
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:09,650
can pre activate and begin kicking us so

1311
01:03:05,539 --> 01:03:12,380
you will be treating on Thursday yeah

1312
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:14,480
cuz today is Tuesday ok pre activating

1313
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:18,890
Tuesday Bruins they treat Thursday got

1314
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:21,769
it and so this is enough for one round

1315
01:03:18,889 --> 01:03:23,598
and then you guys sell do you guys sell

1316
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:26,269
like six packs and twelve packs of those

1317
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,170
yeah each box comes with a box cutter

1318
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:31,539
head yeah

1319
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:31,539
comes with sorry how many - two yeah

1320
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,838
absolutely

1321
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:40,250
Jimmy you want to hold this for a second

1322
01:03:38,838 --> 01:03:43,088
you want to aim it at that's perfect

1323
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:43,088
kind of talking yep

1324
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:56,729
[Music]

1325
01:03:57,929 --> 01:04:04,149
don't need much because it's gonna

1326
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:07,269
absorb in like a little cake and what

1327
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:09,070
you also so it'll start off like so

1328
01:04:07,269 --> 01:04:11,079
it'll absorb in there and what I like to

1329
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:13,480
do is after a few hours flip it over

1330
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:14,920
because gravity has pulled everything at

1331
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,719
the bottom that way you flip it over and

1332
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:20,380
let it pull back through middle again

1333
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:22,599
yeah and then let it rest because if you

1334
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:24,579
are manipulating it during this time you

1335
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:27,159
don't allow certain attachments of the

1336
01:04:24,579 --> 01:04:28,509
biology that's sensitive it helps you

1337
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:30,639
know these are just little fine

1338
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:32,380
practices that you learn over time so

1339
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:34,779
what's actually gonna happen is this

1340
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:38,050
loose material will will begin to

1341
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:40,570
solidify kind of become one more dense

1342
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:42,640
cake and that cakiness is microbial

1343
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:44,800
glues beginning to hold together and the

1344
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:48,339
organic matter bonding and that's what

1345
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:49,960
we want to see and so the next like

1346
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:53,140
we're saying this step would be so

1347
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,970
tomorrow about this time and if you

1348
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:57,219
don't get to it tomorrow and you don't

1349
01:04:54,969 --> 01:04:58,599
brew until Thursday or you know two days

1350
01:04:57,219 --> 01:05:00,730
that's okay because as long as you keep

1351
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:05,880
this moist your biology starting to

1352
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:08,409
activate and go so we will use our our

1353
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:10,930
molasses and what I like to do is make a

1354
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:13,480
little dent on top pour the molasses on

1355
01:05:10,929 --> 01:05:17,199
when it's inside of the inside of the

1356
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:19,119
the chimney this is what right before

1357
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:24,549
you right before you so this would be

1358
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:26,529
right before you brew correct we're

1359
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:27,820
gonna throw it in here we're gonna put a

1360
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:29,830
little divot in it like that

1361
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:32,320
squeeze the molasses on top of it and

1362
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:34,119
then drop it into the drop it into the

1363
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:36,070
extractor and that really just helps us

1364
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:37,630
once again put that sugar right on top

1365
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:40,090
of the jelly just quickly show me where

1366
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:41,650
that goes on yeah and then if we could

1367
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:44,400
plug it in you guys we could show the

1368
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:44,400
aeration process

1369
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:51,610
okay so lays on top comes right down and

1370
01:05:49,389 --> 01:05:54,670
the water level will come to about

1371
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:56,950
midway in to the basket because there's

1372
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:59,650
another thing is you don't want that

1373
01:05:56,949 --> 01:06:01,088
by Oh pack to be overly submerged you

1374
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:03,070
don't want the bio pack to end up down

1375
01:06:01,088 --> 01:06:04,690
here in the bottom corner because then

1376
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:08,079
it's not getting the oxygen can you

1377
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:11,740
rotate that so I can see the the markers

1378
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:13,599
on the back there we go okay so you

1379
01:06:11,739 --> 01:06:16,719
basically want to fill it up to 15

1380
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:19,359
liters 16 quarts 16 cores correct and

1381
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:21,929
then okay it runs Midway to through the

1382
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:24,819
chimney and the chimney is designed to

1383
01:06:21,929 --> 01:06:27,009
hold the bio pack just above the

1384
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:29,710
diffusers so the oxygen comes up and

1385
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:31,630
continues the cavitate and agitate and

1386
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:33,760
knock that biology out of the biopatch

1387
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:35,858
and we put it in that little pillow

1388
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,170
because it helps keep all of your

1389
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:40,239
organic matter and sediment in it allows

1390
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:41,800
the biology to escape and it makes it so

1391
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:43,539
that this is a clean solution to use in

1392
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:46,720
sprayers and emitters and you won't be

1393
01:06:43,539 --> 01:06:48,159
clogging your lines so that was one of

1394
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:51,069
one of our yeah how frequently do you

1395
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:53,469
wanna do you want to make tea I like

1396
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:56,500
once a week and in our feeding schedule

1397
01:06:53,469 --> 01:06:58,389
we recommend once a week because and do

1398
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:01,030
you have different like maybe more

1399
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:03,368
fungal dominant teas for early in the in

1400
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:05,140
the plant's life cycle and bacterial of

1401
01:07:03,369 --> 01:07:08,140
dominant teas later in the life cycle

1402
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:10,059
well we go for a balance of biology

1403
01:07:08,139 --> 01:07:14,139
therefore the plant is able to help

1404
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:15,940
indicate and process which it which

1405
01:07:14,139 --> 01:07:17,920
environment it would prefer so in other

1406
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:19,480
words your tea recipe doesn't change it

1407
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,680
doesn't change from beginning to end and

1408
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:25,389
so the the what changes is the plants

1409
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:27,098
indication to the biology to keep the

1410
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:29,259
set that it would prefer during that

1411
01:07:27,099 --> 01:07:31,809
stage of its growth and what are some of

1412
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:34,720
the all-star bacterial and fungal or

1413
01:07:31,809 --> 01:07:37,838
innate organisms that are currently

1414
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:40,209
sleeping right now oh yeah thirty

1415
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:41,769
thousand there's there's so many they

1416
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:43,780
all really I wouldn't say they're all

1417
01:07:41,769 --> 01:07:46,000
important that's the key I mean you know

1418
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:48,760
you can buy a bag of bacterial inoculant

1419
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,530
and read you know 1624 bacterial strains

1420
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,359
that are in it but really the arsh

1421
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:54,369
oh it's underneath our feet we can't

1422
01:07:52,358 --> 01:07:55,929
even count right now you know so that

1423
01:07:54,369 --> 01:07:58,539
the importance is more having the

1424
01:07:55,929 --> 01:08:00,989
diversity and everybody fulfill its role

1425
01:07:58,539 --> 01:08:04,079
in the in the in the in the

1426
01:08:00,989 --> 01:08:06,179
and this this is your nice product - so

1427
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:08,579
you developed this was this a trial and

1428
01:08:06,179 --> 01:08:12,769
error or process yeah we went we went

1429
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:17,100
back and forth with with labs to develop

1430
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:19,259
what ingredients and what elements at

1431
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:21,989
what measurements go in with the

1432
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:24,420
castings in comparison to the volume of

1433
01:08:21,988 --> 01:08:26,159
water and the diffusion of air and so

1434
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:29,039
all these variables with many

1435
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:31,979
calculations we found found the magic

1436
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:34,319
cake recipe and this is what develops a

1437
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:38,419
balance of biology high diversity and

1438
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:41,160
high chitin in cellulose recyclers yep

1439
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:43,310
now we basically absorbed it all flip it

1440
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:45,869
over and it's ready to go for the night

1441
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:48,810
awesome should it is it ideal keep it

1442
01:08:45,869 --> 01:08:52,108
out or put it in the shade shade cover

1443
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:53,880
it not necessarily you know it like once

1444
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:56,489
again the dry Sun you want it in your

1445
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,298
grill now that's all you don't want wait

1446
01:08:56,488 --> 01:09:02,909
you wouldn't want to put in the

1447
01:08:57,298 --> 01:09:07,140
refrigerator or the freezer right okay

1448
01:09:02,909 --> 01:09:09,528
so it looks like for now were so should

1449
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:12,480
we be giving this kind of like a

1450
01:09:09,529 --> 01:09:14,850
all-around watering I would recommend a

1451
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:17,338
nice little cake it down yeah with if

1452
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:20,430
you have a good wand that gives it a

1453
01:09:17,338 --> 01:09:23,939
nice rainwater 1/5 like it got rained on

1454
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:27,750
more than a jet effect that much what

1455
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:30,119
yeah more than a fire hydrant oh my God

1456
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:32,369
look at that and what it will do one

1457
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:34,289
more time is one more little ounce of

1458
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:35,519
love right not even on the plant but

1459
01:09:34,289 --> 01:09:39,659
once again right where those roots are

1460
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:41,219
going to be migrating to and looking for

1461
01:09:39,659 --> 01:09:42,899
that food because as we water it's going

1462
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:48,600
to push that right down into this little

1463
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:50,389
top zone that top inch layer of root

1464
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:53,390
zone is some of the most active and

1465
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:53,390
feeding

1466
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:20,600
you would wanted to wait till it cools

1467
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:20,600
definitely over there all right

1468
01:10:21,149 --> 01:10:26,670
some

1469
01:10:23,729 --> 01:10:30,299
your home grow your you will soon have a

1470
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:31,710
green thumb will have the training

1471
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:34,650
wheels on the whole time will have

1472
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:37,710
professionals coming in every week so

1473
01:10:34,649 --> 01:10:39,738
make sure that you don't f it up I not

1474
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:48,470
on the leaves not on the leaves

1475
01:10:39,738 --> 01:10:48,469
Jen and I just go in between yeah

1476
01:10:55,819 --> 01:11:00,808
beautiful this is my favorite part of

1477
01:10:58,109 --> 01:11:04,368
the afternoon is after its set the first

1478
01:11:00,809 --> 01:11:07,320
watering getting it all ready

1479
01:11:04,368 --> 01:11:10,460
Ann Tom you can you can soak in some of

1480
01:11:07,319 --> 01:11:13,828
that compost that's in there too okay

1481
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:14,460
get that activated a little bit oh yeah

1482
01:11:13,828 --> 01:11:17,518
perfect

1483
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:19,800
good tech so Tom are you excited to not

1484
01:11:17,519 --> 01:11:26,000
have to buy mediocre weed at the

1485
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:26,000
dispensaries that is the most exciting

1486
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:34,559
you know ice it's a conflict if it's

1487
01:11:33,599 --> 01:11:38,630
complicated

1488
01:11:34,559 --> 01:11:38,630
I like supporting small businesses

1489
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:47,540
the industry but you know the media

1490
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:47,539
offers high taxes the taxes are

1491
01:11:49,789 --> 01:11:53,449
you never know where your dollar is

1492
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:55,640
going that you're spending in essence

1493
01:11:53,449 --> 01:11:58,909
yeah you know that that's that's really

1494
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:01,460
true and I marked upon that in one of

1495
01:11:58,909 --> 01:12:04,579
our recent things is you know as a

1496
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:07,569
patient and and a consumer you know 30

1497
01:12:04,579 --> 01:12:07,569
percent where is it all going

1498
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:24,059
so basically for like so we'll whip up a

1499
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:27,300
tea that we're gonna put on in about two

1500
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:29,310
days and then in terms of you said which

1501
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:32,010
one should we be putting like a drop or

1502
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:34,170
two into the watering can so the T by

1503
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:36,210
itself is great you can just add the tea

1504
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:39,300
so low on your first first couple

1505
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:41,760
waterings start to get the the food

1506
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:43,860
sources unlocked ready for biology to

1507
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,300
eat and then once you start to really

1508
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:47,399
once the plans start to really develop

1509
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,960
these first set and start to get real

1510
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:51,089
hungry then you're gonna start the

1511
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:54,000
nitrogen process with a couple other

1512
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:57,060
additives so you'll do a V n dry soluble

1513
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:01,469
high nitrogen ten to two and then you'll

1514
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:04,680
use a fulvic acid and a humic acid and

1515
01:13:01,469 --> 01:13:06,060
those three with the tea will be really

1516
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,829
really helpful to kind of keep the

1517
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:09,120
plants healthy get them what they need

1518
01:13:07,829 --> 01:13:12,210
you know you how you're gonna have

1519
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:14,609
protein development carbohydrates and

1520
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:16,529
then also a high nitrogen to really keep

1521
01:13:14,609 --> 01:13:18,238
that plant healthy you have the premium

1522
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:19,679
mix in there already so you know you're

1523
01:13:18,238 --> 01:13:21,419
gonna have really good biology all

1524
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:26,000
throughout and then you're adding the

1525
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:28,739
the microbial solutions yeah definitely

1526
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,020
yeah and then basically time not on the

1527
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:33,209
leaves and then basically stick to that

1528
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:34,620
regimen and so flour yeah really it's so

1529
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:36,600
simple you just kind of sticking to that

1530
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:40,500
regimen you know when you start to move

1531
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:42,780
into when you when the the Sun switch is

1532
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,310
you start to move into transition into

1533
01:13:42,779 --> 01:13:45,689
flour then what you're going to do is

1534
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:48,360
you're gonna use a four five five and

1535
01:13:45,689 --> 01:13:49,589
all-purpose so you can add a little bit

1536
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:52,170
of this you can add a little bit of that

1537
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:53,489
as you move in so that's a four five

1538
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:54,840
five where it starts to bring in a

1539
01:13:53,488 --> 01:13:58,079
little phosphorous a little potassium

1540
01:13:54,840 --> 01:14:00,600
and then when the flours completely stop

1541
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:03,899
stretching they start to bulk up then

1542
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:05,940
you want to move into a zero ten eight

1543
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:08,699
where you're completely eliminating the

1544
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:10,710
the nitrogen but there's gonna be plants

1545
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:12,809
that in genetics that definitely still

1546
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:14,969
like to have a little bit of nitrogen as

1547
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:17,310
they go so you can take maybe a half a

1548
01:14:14,969 --> 01:14:19,109
teaspoon of this add it to a teaspoon to

1549
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:20,910
that and so you're gonna get you're

1550
01:14:19,109 --> 01:14:22,829
gonna get a little bit of both going

1551
01:14:20,909 --> 01:14:24,510
into flour and then once you're familiar

1552
01:14:22,829 --> 01:14:26,670
with your genetics you know whether

1553
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:28,260
they're the type that like that or not

1554
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:29,579
yeah so you could really play with these

1555
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:32,310
boxes

1556
01:14:29,579 --> 01:14:35,340
based on your genetics and then and then

1557
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:38,130
create your own recipe in a sense create

1558
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:39,449
your own recipe and the VK is a great

1559
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:40,739
flower finisher so that's going to kind

1560
01:14:39,449 --> 01:14:42,210
of you know you want to you want to

1561
01:14:40,739 --> 01:14:45,029
fatten those flowers out you want to

1562
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:48,329
push out some some yield you'll move

1563
01:14:45,029 --> 01:14:52,050
into a VK some genetics don't like foss

1564
01:14:48,329 --> 01:14:55,439
phosphorus and you know sometimes you

1565
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:57,029
know a high phosphate the plant some

1566
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:58,199
people don't like the foxtail some do

1567
01:14:57,029 --> 01:15:01,409
just it's just kind of one of those

1568
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:04,769
taste things but you'll this a high

1569
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:07,349
phosphorus so you pull back and and add

1570
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:09,510
just that high potassium and so that's

1571
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:11,460
gonna help a lot now I have a question

1572
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:14,100
are these plants they're being treated

1573
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:17,279
so well and being fed so well are they

1574
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:22,440
gonna get like massively huge do that

1575
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:24,239
are they gonna need to be repotted okay

1576
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:26,759
so these these will get pretty big but

1577
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:27,960
honestly the time of year plus the size

1578
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,760
of the seed they're gonna be real

1579
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:31,439
they're gonna be nice and we can do Tom

1580
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,909
as you can kind of and maybe you'll have

1581
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:34,409
somebody on there that can that can

1582
01:15:32,909 --> 01:15:36,869
explain it really well but you can start

1583
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:43,349
to prune and start to really train your

1584
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:45,630
plants to stay you wanna have you want

1585
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:46,920
to have some some you know there's some

1586
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:49,319
humidity in the air so you definitely

1587
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:50,789
want to have a nice training kind of

1588
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:52,859
bring them out this way leave a little

1589
01:15:50,789 --> 01:15:54,300
oxygen through the middle here so this

1590
01:15:52,859 --> 01:15:56,849
way you don't create any pockets of

1591
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:58,470
stagnant air and so this is just you

1592
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:59,850
know this is what's fun about growing is

1593
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:01,890
kind of just looking at this and going

1594
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:03,600
man this this looks real chunky let me

1595
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:06,030
take a couple leaves out at the bottom

1596
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,190
and really start to have air flowing

1597
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:09,899
through the bottom you know having a

1598
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:12,299
swoop of air come on the bottom through

1599
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:13,949
the top that breathing again it's all

1600
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:16,590
about that balance and that breathing

1601
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:20,369
between the soil and the plants both

1602
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:22,440
both atmospheres really so it's nice and

1603
01:16:20,369 --> 01:16:25,590
that's the experience you know every

1604
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:27,299
round of growing you learn something you

1605
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:29,279
know and it's it's fun when for our

1606
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:30,810
business it's so great that we actually

1607
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:32,639
work with the majority cannabis growers

1608
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:33,690
because they have four four times a year

1609
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,270
or more

1610
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:38,309
to make mistakes and so they progressed

1611
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:40,950
faster we're an in conventional

1612
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:42,360
agriculture agriculture you have one one

1613
01:16:40,949 --> 01:16:44,279
mistake a year

1614
01:16:42,359 --> 01:16:46,469
so it doesn't grow scale you know scale

1615
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:49,229
you know so you know mistakes are really

1616
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:52,139
how you can become a better grower so

1617
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:53,849
having four mistakes a year you're

1618
01:16:52,139 --> 01:16:55,859
really you know you really start to

1619
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:57,510
experience what the plant loves and you

1620
01:16:55,859 --> 01:16:58,920
just become better at better so because

1621
01:16:57,510 --> 01:17:00,630
of that are you constantly improving

1622
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:02,460
upon these products as well you know

1623
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:04,590
honestly yeah that's that's what it was

1624
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:06,539
you know we we in the beginning we're

1625
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:07,889
using animal by-product as well and we

1626
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:09,750
decided you know we wanted to take it a

1627
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:10,739
step further and go towards the

1628
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:12,810
sustainability

1629
01:17:10,738 --> 01:17:15,899
you know our fertilizers have zero waste

1630
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:18,030
both as a fertilizer itself and the

1631
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:19,559
manufacturing a lot of animal

1632
01:17:18,029 --> 01:17:20,908
by-products a lot of minerals these are

1633
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:22,230
being pulled from the earth and are

1634
01:17:20,908 --> 01:17:23,759
unsustainable you know you're going to

1635
01:17:22,229 --> 01:17:25,678
you're going to large mines to pull

1636
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,119
minerals if you're looking for full lake

1637
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:29,760
you're going to the Himalayas to pull

1638
01:17:27,118 --> 01:17:33,149
from the Himalayan mountains if you're

1639
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:35,340
if you're looking for you know animal

1640
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:36,929
by-product you really you can't do that

1641
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:39,420
on a small scale you're really going to

1642
01:17:36,929 --> 01:17:41,789
conventional farming to pull their waste

1643
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:44,100
product to develop a product that then

1644
01:17:41,789 --> 01:17:46,170
you can put into a garden like this so

1645
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:48,480
we took it a step further and entirely

1646
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:50,310
not only in our products but just the

1647
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:51,868
the philosophy of our company the

1648
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:54,449
culture of our company and that's why

1649
01:17:51,868 --> 01:17:58,139
you see we have post-consumer boxes for

1650
01:17:54,448 --> 01:18:00,089
the fertilizer not plastic essentially

1651
01:17:58,139 --> 01:18:02,159
you could call them vegan yeah no animal

1652
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:04,020
by-product no mining no heavy mining

1653
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:07,170
there's no there's no heavy metals in

1654
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:09,719
these so not only is it available to the

1655
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:12,590
plant via carbon via facilitated

1656
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:14,609
facilitated passive diffusion but also

1657
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:18,510
you know you don't have that breakdown

1658
01:18:14,609 --> 01:18:20,969
the salt so your soil is always going to

1659
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:24,719
be rich in carbon when you use these

1660
01:18:20,969 --> 01:18:28,829
products so you know I think the next

1661
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:30,569
stage and organic gardening will be you

1662
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:32,399
know things these are coming from

1663
01:18:30,569 --> 01:18:35,340
fermentations and more biological

1664
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:37,019
sources rather than animal sources or

1665
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:39,150
heavy mining sources and you guys are

1666
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:40,590
certainly going in that direction yeah

1667
01:18:39,149 --> 01:18:41,670
definitely yeah that's that's the

1668
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:43,279
direction we're headed we've been

1669
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:48,060
working on these for the past five years

1670
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:50,039
you know a heavy research and

1671
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:52,230
development phase I was slowly brought

1672
01:18:50,039 --> 01:18:54,840
it out they also people want that now

1673
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:56,308
exactly yeah exactly and I mean and are

1674
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,319
you just applying this stuff at

1675
01:18:56,309 --> 01:19:00,119
scale on the 10-acre hem farm yeah

1676
01:18:58,319 --> 01:19:02,699
definitely this is all its scale in fact

1677
01:19:00,118 --> 01:19:04,139
the the you can really the scale of this

1678
01:19:02,698 --> 01:19:06,478
is actually easier than the smaller

1679
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:09,179
version so big farms can use this and

1680
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:12,030
the great thing about this because it is

1681
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:15,208
extracted from microbials and and and

1682
01:19:12,029 --> 01:19:17,188
and attached to carbon becomes its it's

1683
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:19,588
a liquid and then we dehydrate that

1684
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:22,469
liquid and becomes soluble so it becomes

1685
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:24,689
solution it doesn't it doesn't have it

1686
01:19:22,469 --> 01:19:27,748
doesn't relay it rely on ionic reactions

1687
01:19:24,689 --> 01:19:29,519
to break down it becomes solution so you

1688
01:19:27,748 --> 01:19:32,458
can put it through all irrigation

1689
01:19:29,519 --> 01:19:35,159
through fertigation Tiptree you know any

1690
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:37,050
kind of a drip tape and so for scale

1691
01:19:35,158 --> 01:19:39,328
when you go to a conventional farmer

1692
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:42,179
which is the goal ultimately is to as to

1693
01:19:39,328 --> 01:19:44,068
help them reduce the the synthetic use

1694
01:19:42,179 --> 01:19:45,449
or chemical use or high salt products

1695
01:19:44,069 --> 01:19:47,309
and say hey look it you don't really

1696
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:49,108
have to do anything just add this

1697
01:19:47,309 --> 01:19:50,338
because it's organic and you have to go

1698
01:19:49,109 --> 01:19:52,769
through everything is it more expensive

1699
01:19:50,338 --> 01:19:55,019
to produce this more like costly

1700
01:19:52,769 --> 01:19:57,149
products um you know at first three

1701
01:19:55,019 --> 01:19:58,619
years ago it was but now that people

1702
01:19:57,149 --> 01:20:00,419
have really taken to it and like it

1703
01:19:58,618 --> 01:20:02,488
gives us the ability to produce more in

1704
01:20:00,418 --> 01:20:04,559
volume so then that helps us kind of

1705
01:20:02,488 --> 01:20:05,998
reduce the cost and then because we're

1706
01:20:04,559 --> 01:20:08,128
reducing a cost we can get it to scale

1707
01:20:05,998 --> 01:20:08,550
which allows us to reduce cost even

1708
01:20:08,128 --> 01:20:10,708
further

1709
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:13,109
it's a virtuous circle yeah virtuous

1710
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:14,668
cycle yeah so costs are coming back

1711
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:16,338
costs are coming down and so and people

1712
01:20:14,668 --> 01:20:18,689
are adopting it and we've had great

1713
01:20:16,338 --> 01:20:21,378
great feedback from from the grower

1714
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:25,199
community I mean absolutely beautiful

1715
01:20:21,378 --> 01:20:28,279
feedback from everybody that's great you

1716
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:30,509
also did you have customers

1717
01:20:28,279 --> 01:20:34,219
international are you guys yeah

1718
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:38,849
definitely you know we Vietnam Thailand

1719
01:20:34,219 --> 01:20:43,349
UK and all the way down to Colombia to

1720
01:20:38,849 --> 01:20:45,059
Jamaica to turned out to Bay go yeah all

1721
01:20:43,349 --> 01:20:48,659
over you know they're bringing some

1722
01:20:45,059 --> 01:20:51,029
righteous acreage on on in Colombia

1723
01:20:48,658 --> 01:20:52,799
anyway yeah yeah definitely and so we're

1724
01:20:51,029 --> 01:20:54,059
we're it took a little while but people

1725
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,260
are adopting the products down there

1726
01:20:54,059 --> 01:20:56,668
governments are letting them come

1727
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:59,248
through once they learn what they are

1728
01:20:56,668 --> 01:21:00,510
and so the process of sending things

1729
01:20:59,248 --> 01:21:04,469
down there has become much easier

1730
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:06,300
definitely yeah yeah yeah there's a lot

1731
01:21:04,469 --> 01:21:09,010
of taxes maybe essentially double the

1732
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:13,699
price before it hits the land yeah

1733
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:18,010
all right well I think episode number

1734
01:21:13,699 --> 01:21:22,939
one of Tom's green thumb is in the books

1735
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:24,320
in the books whoa we're eventually gonna

1736
01:21:22,939 --> 01:21:25,909
fill them up and we got a foot more

1737
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:28,939
plants we thought we were gonna have

1738
01:21:25,909 --> 01:21:31,250
that option well we have some of those

1739
01:21:28,939 --> 01:21:32,949
perfect we do have some of the Fox farm

1740
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:35,300
that we could put in some of those and

1741
01:21:32,949 --> 01:21:37,939
so with that stuff like we just took a

1742
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:40,630
bag of Fox Farm you'd put which which

1743
01:21:37,939 --> 01:21:43,519
ones did you you added the worm castings

1744
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:47,900
so to the base mix what should we just

1745
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:49,790
put like a spoonful of into well if you

1746
01:21:47,899 --> 01:21:51,139
wanted to have a similar consistency

1747
01:21:49,789 --> 01:21:53,060
these are a little smaller so you

1748
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:55,039
actually probably want to have a little

1749
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:57,560
bit more water attention given the size

1750
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:59,539
of the pots but basically just add take

1751
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:01,070
and since you're using these types of

1752
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:03,649
pots I would probably go 10% worm

1753
01:22:01,069 --> 01:22:06,649
castings of our worm castings in in like

1754
01:22:03,649 --> 01:22:10,099
a fox farm or a roots or something at

1755
01:22:06,649 --> 01:22:11,449
the store that's good quality soil and

1756
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:14,060
then you would do the same thing out a

1757
01:22:11,449 --> 01:22:16,609
little granular to the root zone take a

1758
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:17,930
little worm casting dust in the dust in

1759
01:22:16,609 --> 01:22:24,369
that in the root zone and then I'd get

1760
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:24,369
some mycorrhizae we didn't have to yeah

1761
01:22:25,329 --> 01:22:29,720
where do people go to check out more

1762

yeah and then also our instagram which

1765
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:39,649
is at organics alive and yeah we you

1766
01:22:37,579 --> 01:22:42,019
know we've we're having a good time

1767
01:22:39,649 --> 01:22:45,619
farming and yeah you got to send us some

1768
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:55,820
pictures from that yeah stuff yeah yeah

1769
01:22:45,619 --> 01:22:58,849
we're we're documenting thanks for

1770
01:22:55,819 --> 01:23:00,949
thanks for having us this one's already

1771
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:02,720
growing look it's already praying you

1772
01:23:00,949 --> 01:23:05,300
see that honestly look at that thing

1773
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,840
it's so happy look at this look at this

1774
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,699
one

1775
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,590
you know what I mean like right away

1776
01:23:07,699 --> 01:23:12,199
they're just you know they're just like

1777
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:19,190
oh thank you so much you know but you

1778
01:23:12,199 --> 01:23:21,250
don't yeah yeah I mean already well they

1779
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:21,250
were

1780
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:25,700
yeah good genetics you know this is

1781
01:23:24,319 --> 01:23:27,319
that's great it's so that's a great

1782
01:23:25,699 --> 01:23:29,869
sight to see that when they start to

1783
01:23:27,319 --> 01:23:30,920
reach for the Sun that means those soils

1784
01:23:29,869 --> 01:23:33,949
are eaten you know the roots are

1785
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:36,020
reaching for soil so it's fantastic not

1786
01:23:33,949 --> 01:23:42,679
it's it's gonna be good a good garden

1787
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:44,600
tom well this is exciting so yeah I

1788
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:46,340
think Tom we need to I mean we don't

1789
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:51,530
necessarily need to do it today but we

1790
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:53,420
should get basically some soil and and

1791
01:23:51,529 --> 01:23:57,019
then what we'll do is we'll leave all

1792
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:58,909
the pounds behind because for this

1793
01:23:57,020 --> 01:24:00,830
garden you really it's going to be such

1794
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:03,019
a minimal amount so this will stay for

1795
01:24:00,829 --> 01:24:07,130
you and then we'll leave the pints as

1796
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:08,420
well and then you could just and what

1797
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:12,500
we'll do is though there's a there's a

1798
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:14,270
feed chart so this we should just throw

1799
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:16,779
in his garage right yeah throw that in

1800
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:18,950
the garage with the sad tom

1801
01:24:16,779 --> 01:24:21,679
should we put a little more water is

1802
01:24:18,949 --> 01:24:23,659
that totally just needs to be moist yeah

1803
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:26,270
really just kind of that quarter cup

1804
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:29,779
just to kind of get things moist arrived

1805
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:35,000
so it stays nice and cool you know out

1806
01:24:29,779 --> 01:24:37,279
here is actually not that bad yeah so

1807
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,659
yeah since so those four plants really

1808
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:41,420
this is going to be all you need for the

1809
01:24:38,659 --> 01:24:43,699
whole three months yeah this this little

1810
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:45,949
package here will get you through no

1811
01:24:43,699 --> 01:24:48,229
problem and then we're gonna leave you

1812
01:24:45,949 --> 01:24:51,130
that bag and then maybe if we come back

1813
01:24:48,229 --> 01:24:53,179
for another you know part three or four

1814
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:54,739
what you want to do Tom's you want to

1815
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:56,930
come back when when they start to flower

1816
01:24:54,739 --> 01:24:59,479
you give them a nice top dress with this

1817
01:24:56,930 --> 01:25:02,320
and another round of castings and

1818
01:24:59,479 --> 01:25:07,809
compost and and this will really help

1819
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:10,809
you know reinvigorate that that's soil

1820
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:10,810
yeah

1821
01:25:11,469 --> 01:25:15,670
I will be here we can eat you and

1822
01:25:13,719 --> 01:25:18,399
honestly if traffic keeps up like this

1823
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:30,760
we can be up here no problem to help out

1824
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:36,969
honestly so where most of you got your

1825
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:39,340
guys a lot of bigger farms actually yeah

1826
01:25:36,969 --> 01:25:41,170
you know we're we do some retail - up in

1827
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:42,969
Humboldt you know here and they're

1828
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:45,460
scattered but honestly we go direct us

1829
01:25:42,969 --> 01:25:46,630
farmer yeah yeah we're in some shops

1830
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:49,689
here and they're all pretty much all

1831
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:51,520
over the country Michigan was that's

1832
01:25:49,689 --> 01:25:53,889
what I was wondering because there's no

1833
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:58,469
limitation to where you can sell your

1834
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:58,469
products and how so you be go into

1835
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:08,800
actually you know we do you started this

1836
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:11,579
business in 2002 Eric and I we started

1837
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:15,190

1838
01:26:11,579 --> 01:26:19,260
2013 is really when you start up and you

1839
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:21,789

1840
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:23,770
just like generally like how many

1841
01:26:21,789 --> 01:26:25,180
employees do you guys have right now at

1842
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:27,130
this moment because we're working on the

1843
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:28,000
farm a 13 ploy ease it's good sites

1844
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:30,609
that's a good number

1845
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:33,640

01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:56,050
community yeah yeah our name really

1857
01:26:54,488 --> 01:26:58,569
means a lot to us how we treat our

1858
01:26:56,050 --> 01:27:01,590
customers is paramount to we'll review

1859
01:26:58,569 --> 01:27:04,299
our customer service we answer calls we

1860
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:06,579
why it was Nick Thomas Eenie who gave

1861
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:09,310
you guys the shadow cuz I was like give

1862
01:27:06,579 --> 01:27:12,010
me for me I was kind of like I know you

1863
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:14,580
and Scott and whoever probably like

1864
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:17,140
don't use a lot of commercial products

1865
01:27:14,579 --> 01:27:19,238
but not everybody's you guys and knows

1866
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:21,340
what the fuck they're doing so if you

1867
01:27:19,238 --> 01:27:24,099
were a Tom hi I'm just wanting to do

1868
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:28,659
stuff in his backyard like what do you

1869
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:30,940
prove of and and so you mentioned you

1870
01:27:28,659 --> 01:27:32,710
guys because I think I'd originally said

1871
01:27:30,939 --> 01:27:38,409
to him I was like you know what do you

1872
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:40,949
think of down to earth right oh yeah yes

1873
01:27:38,409 --> 01:27:43,869
that's more like the meals and yeah and

1874
01:27:40,949 --> 01:27:47,439
the animal you know so that's not really

1875
01:27:43,869 --> 01:27:49,180
what you guys do know a little bit or

1876
01:27:47,439 --> 01:27:49,829
you are doing like Santa Barbara those

1877
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:53,890
fall

1878
01:27:49,829 --> 01:27:55,750
Barbara Salinas yeah yeah so you do

1879
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:57,850
everything like you you like DAP and you

1880
01:27:55,750 --> 01:28:01,750
and every everything everybody yeah from

1881
01:27:57,850 --> 01:28:03,940
oranges to apples to Protestant really

1882
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:05,829
small to large you know we even went

1883
01:28:03,939 --> 01:28:11,009
through a period which people have

1884
01:28:05,829 --> 01:28:16,149
adopted the business but we used to help

1885
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:20,380
the pine trees repel pine bark beetle by

1886
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:23,789
injecting that tea into the soil so so

1887
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:23,789
what you can do the biology's yeah

1888
01:28:32,119 --> 01:28:37,769
one thing I forgot to ask was kind of

1889
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:39,659
like sometimes people you know people

1890
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:41,460
talk about like building your soil and

1891
01:28:39,659 --> 01:28:43,529
then letting it sit for six months

1892
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:50,100
because it's way too hot so this is not

1893
01:28:43,529 --> 01:28:54,059
way too hot because your stuff is not

1894
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:59,310
the main component it's the like 2%

1895
01:28:54,060 --> 01:29:01,860
additional stuff or five 10% so what was

1896
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:03,660
the ratio of worm castings in here 10

1897
01:29:01,859 --> 01:29:10,769
percent is what 20 percent oh we didn't

1898
01:29:03,659 --> 01:29:12,739
twenty percent twenty percent yeah let

1899
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:18,570
me look before you get close to it that

1900
01:29:12,739 --> 01:29:20,639
one that's a wasp yeah so don't get near

1901
01:29:18,569 --> 01:29:31,889
that guy yeah he's not gonna come after

1902
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:33,150
you as long as you don't go after him so

1903
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:35,340
basically what we can do is we can put

1904
01:29:33,149 --> 01:29:39,299
like I have a shoot like one that's only

1905
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:42,119
two feet wide by four and then you could

1906
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:44,550
put like tomato on a build here is what

1907
01:29:42,119 --> 01:29:48,119
a home would be which is the tomato is

1908
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:50,909
the basil the you know the squash the

1909
01:29:48,119 --> 01:29:53,460
and then just like a couple cannabis

1910
01:29:50,909 --> 01:30:01,309
plants around yeah it's like the wife's

1911
01:29:53,460 --> 01:30:01,310
happy the husband's have yeah now we go

1912
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:13,030
oh that's a great idea

1913
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:13,030
here in America there they actually have

1914
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:24,800
that's that's our next episode is

1915
01:30:19,489 --> 01:30:26,719
actually companion planting we have the

1916
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:29,329
biology and then we get some other

1917
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:31,610
components that are working in unison

1918
01:30:29,329 --> 01:30:33,710
with that right set of biology on the

1919
01:30:31,609 --> 01:30:37,609
you know it all get off the minds to

1920
01:30:33,710 --> 01:30:40,420
each other so we just got one marigold

1921
01:30:37,609 --> 01:30:42,319
or let go I would go in each corner and

1922
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:44,590
but just you know you get those little

1923
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:46,909
single - start with a little small

1924
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:49,159
cancers not gonna take over

1925
01:30:46,909 --> 01:30:50,479
yeah you guys you want them to be able

1926
01:30:49,159 --> 01:30:53,659
to have one to grow up but then your

1927
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:55,489
marigold concealers you'll be teleported

1928
01:30:53,659 --> 01:30:58,720
and right in the middle wait a little

1929
01:30:55,489 --> 01:31:01,219
bit what a way way a little bit on

1930
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:05,470
marigolds these these will grow very

1931
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:05,470
fast okay yeah check the miracles back

1932
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:09,010
there already
