00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:11,550
you do a favor and pack a bag for me I

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:16,829
use prayer press is that is there one I

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:21,829
already packed okay all right so first

5
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:24,899
of all what flower is this this is MK

6
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:26,368
mk91 is what it is it's a cross that we

7
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:32,989
have for my friends here

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,990
I think it's tri-state distribution

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,730
[Music]

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:50,370
these are different types so yes where I

11
00:00:38,729 --> 00:01:00,149
was there a flower I guess since I have

12
00:00:50,369 --> 00:01:04,469
this hat all right the one we're doing

13
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:07,590
is yours so what is this right here

14
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:12,420
decima Scotty the Scotty yeah and

15
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:14,909
galactic guys fuck yeah what's your name

16
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:20,060
in I'm sure you got an Instagram yup i

17
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:22,250
TS alright

18
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,260
where it up and if you're also looking

19
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,359
on for the DAX tractor you can go on the

20
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,228
Instagram it's just Dax tractor same at

21
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,650
the website

22
00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:33,228
when did you built this recently so I've

23
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,080
been making hash since like 1994 I

24
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:37,908
started with a friend of mine in

25
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,920
Columbus Ohio he owns a company called

26
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:43,100
Eden labs that still exists in

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,899
Washington they do co2 extracts I've

28
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:47,750
smoked every type of hash in the world

29
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:50,060
I'm you know a connoisseur of fine

30
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,149
extracts I've been you know at a young

31
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,689
age I someone's guinea pig eating labs

32
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:58,969
help me get there and they do co2 people

33
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:02,689
do a butane people do alcoholics tracks

34
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:06,228
I personally like solvent list extracts

35
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:13,870
so lucky for me I married my wife over

36
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:13,870
here this is put you on the spot

37
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:22,909
so without my 1d by the way thank you so

38
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,689
without my wife I basically couldn't be

39
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:28,819
right here because her uncle is my you

40
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:31,150
know I'm an artist so I drew up the plan

41
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:34,219
and came up with the whole design but

42
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,080
he's my engineer and my machinist they

43
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:38,569
have a machine company or machine shop

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,120
in Johnstown Ohio and they build my

45
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:43,310
equipment and rosin tech is my

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,110
distributors so I invented this and

47
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:49,849
basically it's built the pressed flower

48
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,760
bubble hash and dry sift is what I

49
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:56,210
prefer which is the three solvent list

50
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:58,849
passes you can make I tell me like there

51
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,740
were presses on the market so like what

52
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:03,530
what were you like I want to press that

53
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,360
does this like whoa it's business well

54
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,150
when I started building this press there

55
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,160
wasn't any presses on the market so in

56
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,010
Ohio it's pretty underground we're only

57
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,549
medical just this year but I've been

58
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:28,069
making hash like I said for a long time

59
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:29,930
in legal places well I basically came up

60
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:31,849
with this design because I'm an artist

61
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,040
and I needed to get high but if I slip

62
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:36,500
too much product that has bad solvents

63
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:39,049
in it it gets me sick or it makes my

64
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,780
skin break out or it makes me not

65
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,239
healthy so I wanted to do so solving

66
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:48,770
this model so I went ahead and invented

67
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,920
this at my machine shop and in my art

68
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:54,020
studio and there wasn't uh any other

69
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,139
companies other than a few hair

70
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:59,439
straighteners and

71
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:01,989
some Chinese like shit presses and

72
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,449
people would modify plates to go on to

73
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:07,540
shop presses which I was doing in the

74
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:12,119
beginning but this is the only truth

75
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:14,799
this is the first DMC like electric cut

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,189
carbon steel there's no welds on this

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,829
machine it's just it's all it's like a

78
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:22,779
refined racecar a fried sports car it's

79
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:26,079
built better than any machine out there

80
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:28,359
and it also is able to take 25 times the

81
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:32,579
pressure is inside of this beast and

82
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:36,639
it's all American mates the hydraulics

83
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:39,550
the the frame all the heating elements

84
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,709
are made by watt left even the

85
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,520
electronics our future designs from in

86
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:47,859
the United States SPX the hydraulics

87
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,810
that are inside and here are the best

88
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,389
hydraulics you can get on the market and

89
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,418
I just wanted to be a solid USA product

90
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:57,719
so tell me what goes into making a good

91
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:57,719
price

92
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,759
well you I wanted a compact machine that

93
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:06,519
didn't take up a lot of room in my lab I

94
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,490
also wanted a machine that was quiet so

95
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:11,978
I've been in this silent and it's also a

96
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,530
life time frame and a lifetime warranty

97
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:16,629
on the hydraulics because I'm trying to

98
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:18,849
build something that I can not have to

99
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:20,529
reinvest my money in like and I also

100
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:25,000
don't want to waste my money on solvents

101
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:28,629
so all we need is parchment paper and a

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,329
filter and you can make really really

103
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:34,019
good hash this one here was from flour

104
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:39,599
that we've been pressing all day and

105
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:39,599
this is their flour to try stay in the

106
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:48,279
and this is the flour one we also make

107
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,949
bubble hash and pass rosin here at the

108
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:54,728
show lab we have a rosin techlabs now

109
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:56,649
and we distribute and make ash so it's

110
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:59,649
awesome to make the best ash and we need

111
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:02,918
it a small machine because with a lot of

112
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:05,949
power and you also have to have some

113
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:08,649
times more power for flour so this work

114
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:11,740
into flour and hash it so it's an on one

115
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:14,259
machine when you're pressing how do you

116
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,430
like to dial it in like temperature wise

117
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:19,379
micron size fresh

118
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,490
on the side of the machine over here

119
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,610
come around

120
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,590
I put the temp over here and this is the

121
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,229
heating and the tip that you can raise

122
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:30,538
and lower I put it over here so no hash

123
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:33,029
gets on it so it's protected and when

124
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:38,310
you carry it has the Pelican case so I

125
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:40,258
can today because of the heat outside

126
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,819
and I think it's a good number for the

127
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,009
type of humidity we have in the flower

128
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,659
that we're pressing because it's still

129
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:48,240
nice and moist and it's still flow

130
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,729
really good so what do you get at lower

131
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,439
versus higher temperature so if you want

132
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:55,800
to press flower you can usually start

133
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:58,620
around 160 and you can take it up to 220

134
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,939
or those safe safe temperatures and have

135
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,769
you gone between those temperatures

136
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,199
you'll get a nice terpene profile and a

137
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:06,538
good poll extract but the lower number

138
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,000
you'll get a smaller extract for flower

139
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:10,620
but a tastier oil and a little higher

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,110
it'll be a little bit more of an extract

141
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,329
with more Highness like more it's more

142
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,370
more of a percentage on the extract and

143
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:21,180
what do you like to do it at I press my

144
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:23,579
flower so if I'm pressing flower I like

145
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,478
to press my flower about 8 days off the

146
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:29,728
plant maybe about 55% 60% humidity in

147
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:32,899
the plant still and I press it at 180

148
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:35,639
and I usually press it into a jar and I

149
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:37,769
put it in on a lid on it as soon as I

150
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,930
can once the jars filled and I'll either

151
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:42,000
jar take it or I'll just cold tech like

152
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:45,120
a natural cure on it and that's my

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,038
favorite way for both well that's the

154
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,990
rosin one for the flower you know rasa

155
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,478
for you younique you either need to be

156
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,610
growing yourself or have French it helps

157
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,800
you that earlier it helps if you want to

158
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,080
have the best patch you can still go to

159
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,908
the dispensary and buy house plants or

160
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,189
flower and it's still will yield and

161
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:04,379
taste good but if you're picky and you

162
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:06,569
want the best to sell you should grow

163
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:08,310
your own or know somebody that grows I

164
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,409
say you're pressing before

165
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,990
released our securing right because I

166
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:15,390
want the terpenes to still be there so

167
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,210
in the older they get the less they

168
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:20,969
degrades and then my favorite type of

169
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:24,180
hash is bubble hash it's a live bubble

170
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:29,700
hash so we do we take basically the

171
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:31,379
plant well I made a press because to

172
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,029
make my bubble hash better I need to

173
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,549
make a press and I need it to be perfect

174
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:38,250
because the hash is really expensive so

175
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,539
if the plates are not right or the

176
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,669
dimensions aren't right and the

177
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,370
machine's not right you know the hash

178
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,659
won't be good so I basically you can

179
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,580
make it with a hair straightener but

180
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,259
you're going to lose a lot or if you can

181
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,639
make it with almost any of these presses

182
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:52,049
but if you're in a lab and you're doing

183
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,330
a lot you're gonna lose a little bit

184
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:56,519
maybe one force there's a lot on a long

185
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:59,970
run you know a lot of running so

186
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,340
basically I like live rosin the best

187
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,009
because you take the plant when it's

188
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,410
growing when it's done ready to harvest

189
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:09,569
instead of drying it you trim it while

190
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:12,149
it's on the plant you put it into a

191
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:14,550
freezer bag you freeze it and then you

192
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:17,850
wash it bubble hash wise and wash it in

193
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:19,979
a and you put it in a freeze dryer and

194
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,710
what that does is dries your bubble hash

195
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:26,779
faster so the Terps are better and then

196
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:29,129
you wait 24 hours usually maybe 36 and

197
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:31,470
depending on where you live it's very

198
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:35,809
humid and you go from there

199
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,810
okay Nick of T you know Nick

200
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:47,920
so this guy right here yeah yo come here

201
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:49,629
I'm video right now brother we got you

202
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,860
on a video let's do it this is Nick of

203
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:55,899
T's a world renowned hashtag he's been

204
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,450
around he's used the Dex track there and

205
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,429
we make this product for hash makers

206
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,980
like us that needs the best machine

207
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:04,299
because we don't want to have something

208
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,879
break on us during the middle of our

209
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:09,159
making or squashing I could get stuck or

210
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,600
the hose could break whatever but I just

211
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,839
wanted to let you say hi to him real

212
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,690
quick

213
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,750
talk to me about pressing hash because

214
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:19,210
you you like you don't have fries driver

215
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,549
drives that hash it's it's straight up

216
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,410
blonde bubble hash really chrisley it's

217
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:26,709
usually full milk I like to take that

218
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:29,889
full mount for 4 star 5 star and I like

219
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:34,120
to take that put it into a 25 micron bag

220
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:36,610
like one of these and basically if you

221
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,690
fill this up with bubble hash you can

222
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,330
put it right in here

223
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,850
and if it's live like like I said live

224
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,710
material it's the terpenes are going to

225
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,889
be higher than normal and it's also

226
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:49,660
gonna be a very neon in color depending

227
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:52,210
it could be purple even depending on

228
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:53,769
what flower your your president or what

229
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,200
type of bubble house your presence so

230
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:58,689
like we put it in a jar as quick as

231
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,509
possible and we and and that preserves

232
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:04,270
all the turps people sometimes put it in

233
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:06,819
a heat oven and then turn into more of a

234
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:09,220
saucy diamond or you can just cold cure

235
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,200
it and it's more of a batter but both

236
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,920
are some of the best hashes in the world

237
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,110
in my opinion

238
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,299
and this machine is what you need

239
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,629
currently like like who's

240
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:22,629
whose cannabis with what like terpene

241
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:25,629
profile are you digging around well I'm

242
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:27,960
not from Cali so I'm from Ohio

243
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:30,279
so I smoke a lot of Michigan hash

244
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,050
Michigan right now has got some of the

245
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:35,289
best selling list hash that I can find

246
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:38,259
on the market there's multiple cups

247
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:40,779
because we're like hard workers in the

248
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:43,029
Midwest I think and they make a lot of

249
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:45,100
stupid laws that we got to go around so

250
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:46,959
we gotta hide in our basements and make

251
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,300
bubble hash but we've gotten so good at

252
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,730
it it's just how we make our hash but

253
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:53,439
the rest of the world buy all the fancy

254
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,629
butane equipment and they're making

255
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,760
shatter they're making diamonds

256
00:11:55,629 --> 00:12:00,279
while we're back here making you know

257
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,139
water hash so but we've we had to make

258
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:05,259
it better than there so that's where

259
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:10,240
we're about like what are the strains in

260
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:12,069
Michigan that that you're pressing I

261
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,379
have a lot of favorites from Michigan I

262
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:17,680
have a friend called his name Sabbath

263
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:21,460
flower grows he and a bunch of other of

264
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:25,899
his friends I've met basically sh sh o

265
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:28,000
rosin we have superior we have we and I

266
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,759
could go down a huge list but my

267
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,769
favorite ones like a purple pebbles and

268
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,929
then they have a motor breath which is

269
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:37,809
really good at Michigan and it's really

270
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:39,969
gassy and then the purple pebbles tastes

271
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:43,349
just like purple Pebbles cereal when you

272
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,940
hit it like it's it's unbelievable that

273
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,710
that's just my favorite probably too up

274
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:51,580
there the GMO is really good at which is

275
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:53,440
garlic mouth odor is GMO and it tastes

276
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,480
like old man's breath really it's like

277
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,640
really gassy with the stinky stinky

278
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,830
finish but it gets you high as fuck it's

279
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:01,809
super guest

280
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,750
California today so how would you

281
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:09,449
compare kind of like Michigan Ohio and

282
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:13,840
California we've a little bit more heady

283
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:15,850
here more no more more recreational here

284
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,610
maybe a little bit more heady in the

285
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,930
Midwest because smaller batch so with

286
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,820
marijuana you can pay a little bit more

287
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:24,429
attention with it in hand trim it where

288
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,810
a lot of the stuff I see out here people

289
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:28,000
are doing big batch and they have

290
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:30,159
machines that trim it and so the track

291
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,960
curbs get knocked off so but it's really

292
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,719
good weed I'm not putting any Callie

293
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:37,720
weed down and a lot of Callie has you

294
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,550
know small grows as well so now I just

295
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,920
am new here so I haven't been out here

296
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:43,809
is nice but people here have definitely

297
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,509
made some really smoking the weed so

298
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:49,169
yeah it's good all this is really good

299
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:49,169
we for sure

300
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:59,799
I'm just partial yeah what did she like

301
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:03,340
to say we have less what is the wife

302
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:07,059
life does he know you I have yes let her

303
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:14,530
guess this so I whispered to you well I

304
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:16,189
heard what she likes what's your real

305
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:21,329
favor

306
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:23,070
you got it what's my favorite my

307
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,050
favorites Death Star so we're gonna

308
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,560
smash smash this guy's fucking shit here

309
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:32,089
[Music]

310
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:32,089
what's the name of this variety again oh

311
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:43,019
[Music]

312
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:51,510
yeah alright so what we have it right

313
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,850
now at 203 degrees which I think would

314
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:56,279
be a good chirping and a good yield and

315
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,920
what about the flight dial the pressure

316
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,110
yes so the dialing and the pressure is

317
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:03,509
very key so you want to take it slow at

318
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,639
first and build the pressure because we

319
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:10,289
have about how much marijuana do we have

320
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:13,529
here about maybe 10 grams maybe I'd say

321
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:15,870
10 grams by guesstimate so 10 grams you

322
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:18,230
don't need as much as an ounce an ounce

323
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:21,060
I'll take all the way up to 20 tonnes

324
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,070
because this is smaller the pressure is

325
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:24,719
only on this amount of space and it's

326
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,340
less space taken up so you need a little

327
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,920
bit less pressure so I'll take this up

328
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,430
to about 8 tons of pressure which is

329
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,769
right here

330
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,959
and you can do that with only two pumps

331
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:36,139
once the plates are together about two

332
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,230
pi

333
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:39,230
[Applause]

334
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,139
[Music]

335
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,000
[Applause]

336
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,000
so I move around here to the front

337
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:59,850
[Music]

338
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,168
[Music]

339
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,769
I said this is the end press I like it

340
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:28,720
yes sir we can take it nice and slow

341
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:29,370
it's already gushing so what do you

342
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,000
feeling

343
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:34,220
[Music]

344
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,289
right there I was just holding it open

345
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:42,829
so you could see it and I wanted to show

346
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:44,448
you that drip I got it so that's a

347
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:46,969
really good sign when you see it drip

348
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:50,078
like that because he's got mad Terps and

349
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,079
mad THC

350
00:16:52,970 --> 00:17:03,529
and if you smell that smell the Terps

351
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,529
upset

352
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:22,170
[Music]

353
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,410
[Music]

354
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:35,559
we smash that is about as much as you

355
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:39,690
could smash a bag for the size and the

356
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:39,690
extract is clean as you can see

357
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:44,058
[Music]

358
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:50,919
oh yes yeah this guy seems like he's a

359
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:57,990
master he probably makes them really

360
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:57,990
good look at his hat right here this guy

361
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:11,558
very good family there's a huge there's

362
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,960
a huge have talked about the hash seat

363
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,029
like well basically you're like the

364
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,890
middle the reason why I'm here is

365
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:21,009
because I wanted to join an army of hash

366
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:23,669
makers and they have built a team the

367
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:26,408
rosin tech the show labs the dab nation

368
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:29,890
LeBron's and techlabs Dex tractor now

369
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:33,490
we're all the family I was a competitor

370
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:35,200
of theirs for about three years and they

371
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,929
I think realized this was the Machine

372
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,580
they wanted to sell so I've decided I'll

373
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:42,070
get back to painting and doing art and

374
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:44,649
inventing more Wow they sell these for

375
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:46,720
me and we're just gonna be a team and I

376
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,090
need a Salesforce like they and they

377
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,100
allowed to use and we're here I think

378
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:56,259
I'm moving out here we'll see let's see

379
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:58,449
more me out here probably we don't we

380
00:18:56,259 --> 00:19:00,750
don't waste these either so do you want

381
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,750
to move

382
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:12,490
will you miss Ohio the winter she's

383
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:13,960
gonna cry if you ask her that yeah so we

384
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:17,740
don't waste these either we take them

385
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,779
and we collect them after the show we

386
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,660
collect these and we donate them we

387
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:24,430
either make them into food product by

388
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,920
with sokham and alcohol or it make a

389
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,570
tincture or like a coconut oil because

390
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,029
there's a lot of terpenes a lot of stuff

391
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:32,500
stuck in the bag still and you can make

392
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:34,569
a lot of tics here whether it's food

393
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,400
grade or you can make it for whatever if

394
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:39,309
you're pressing hemp you can make it for

395
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,250
CBD a sort go back to like the Ross and

396
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:45,099
sac headquarters and this goes this is

397
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,289
our which is that the recycles might

398
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:49,809
Mike that you it depends on where we're

399
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:51,369
at so if we're at a place doing it they

400
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:54,369
keep their product because that's their

401
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:57,159
product if we're at a tonight this is

402
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:59,199
our product so this is product we own so

403
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,560
we're gonna probably keep it and donate

404
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,410
it

405
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:05,679
somebody is what I think like in LA yeah

406
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:07,870
for friends or family okay whoever is

407
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,250
worthy or whoever is around I guess I

408
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:13,239
don't know I don't know how they handle

409
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:17,200
that I think that it's probably family

410
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,720
and friends maybe maybe me I get a cupid

411
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,580
I don't know I'm pretty nice I mean I

412
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,259
like to make like a salad dressed anyway

413
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:25,359
that are like an oil because it mixes it

414
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:29,049
and you can keep it in a bottle on your

415
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,819
fridge press you ever do a second

416
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:33,509
impression yeah you want to see a second

417
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:35,889
president or there's not a lot of oil

418
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:39,190
but is that something that you normally

419
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:41,770
like would you smoke the second yeah

420
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:45,940
yeah no no no hi oh definitely cuz

421
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:47,500
there's not as much room my second press

422
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:52,950
is just as good as a lot of people's

423
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,950
first press I've good ax tractor

424
00:20:56,349 --> 00:21:02,839
this is John rosin here he's the pimp

425
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:04,970
look at this fucking box he's got look

426
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:05,750
at this thing he's an evil hash dweller

427
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,240
over here

428
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:11,980
he'll dab you out you probably did you

429
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,980
do that to the lady that went out in the

430
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:30,019
you want to pump this one I'll record

431
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:31,759
you here I'll record you so he's going

432
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:34,879
to pump this second press so hold down

433
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:37,700
here while you pump it it's like just

434
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,120
right there so it doesn't come up and

435
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:43,100
then you can go fast now but go ahead

436
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:46,209
and take it to the 5000 you'll feel it

437
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:49,099
shift into second gear once these touch

438
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:54,288
it's easy but once yeah now it's in

439
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:56,119
second gear so take it at 5,000 that's

440
00:21:54,288 --> 00:22:02,990
12 and a half tons of pressure you're

441
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:05,148
creating that's down here so it's

442
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,220
pushing up so that's good you're at

443
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:10,668
Omaha well you don't have to go any more

444
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:15,019
because right now you're at 6,000 psi

445
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:16,759
which is roughly about 14 tons of

446
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:19,069
pressure because we have a 25-ton

447
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:21,679
cylinder inside of here and we're gonna

448
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:23,119
let it sit there but this is a good

449
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,759
video and a good thing to do because

450
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,798
you'll see that the first time you press

451
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,390
on mind you get a lot of oil out that

452
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:31,278
you don't have to do multiple presses

453
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,778
some machines aren't strong enough right

454
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:34,278
so I don't need to do anything there

455
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:36,230
eventually it's gonna come out yeah

456
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:38,929
we're waiting for to see if we got it

457
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:41,329
all the first time which as of right now

458
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:43,340
nothing's coming out except for a little

459
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:45,079
bit right through yeah so we wait for

460
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:46,579
you don't want to waste but if we didn't

461
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,199
do that you could get that in the food

462
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:51,618
product like I was talking about

463
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,419
there's so we don't waste so let's do it

464
00:22:51,618 --> 00:22:57,528
for another ten seconds and then just

465
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:59,769
unscrew that left knob to the left you

466
00:22:57,528 --> 00:23:04,278
have to kind of grip it hard and turn it

467
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:11,899
go ahead you see that pressure release

468
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:14,089
the plates came down so that's the

469
00:23:11,898 --> 00:23:16,849
suited press and you just extracted it

470
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:19,959
yeah and that's how much is in each bag

471
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:24,769
left to do that look at that donation

472
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:29,230
boom and that is how you do a flower

473
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:29,230
rosin now you want to smell the second

474
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,409
still smells really good that's like a

475
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:35,409
first press right
