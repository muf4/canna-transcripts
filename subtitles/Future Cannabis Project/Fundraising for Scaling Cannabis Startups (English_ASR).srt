[Music]

2
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:19,259
we're gonna go into discussion about

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,060
some issues on formation and go into the

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,359
a little bit company culture and then

5
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,518
the fundraise process for for who in a

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,618
in Amanda when you guys first started

7
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,000
forming your companies when when do you

8
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:31,439
think it was necessary to first engage a

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
lawyer and like the kind of lawyers that

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,429
you thought were necessary along the way

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,689
I know for companies for example to

12
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:38,128
touch the plant you know they make them

13
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:39,390
everything oh I need to get my my

14
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:40,949
license first and we go get our

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,780
regulatory 'el you know attorney and

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,520
then I regulatory might end up saying

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,840
you know I can do everything for you but

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,030
they might have the corporate expertise

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,430
so we sometimes have clients that come

20
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,439
over to us with that issue and said that

21
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,420
it might be interesting to see so what

22
00:00:52,439 --> 00:01:00,269
your perspective is on when lawyers

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:02,070
became relevant okay I won't tell you

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,920
why did I want tell you it may not be

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:10,438
what you want to do so I met my lawyer

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:14,180
over oysters at UH and Tomales Bay at a

27
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:16,829
friend's birthday party yiii lawyer and

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:21,000
wanted to get into the space and wanted

29
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:23,090
to help and so he actually formed a lot

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,799
of our documentation in the early days

31
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,909
then we got into Y Combinator my

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,320
O'Connor inna has a whole legal

33
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,868
department thankfully he didn't mess

34
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,298
anything up and they validate it and it

35
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:37,409
worked out pretty well but I kind of

36
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,990
hacked I had as well in the industry was

37
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:45,060
leveraging the legal of my counterparts

38
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:47,699
or my partners which has helped bridge

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,350
some gaps here and there where you can

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,519
see a lot of different documentation and

41
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:52,379
compare notes and then you can bring it

42
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,769
to a lawyer and kind of like understand

43
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,359
how to formulate your own those are you

44
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:00,718
know some ways I've been able to

45
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:03,840
navigate legal but any of your raising

46
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,839
financing you know it's really important

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,700
to get your structure right otherwise

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,909
you may be at the finish line and can't

49
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,909
cross

50
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:16,719
um I mean granted I'm a lawyer so I

51
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,759
probably started earlier as soon as

52
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,039
money was being spent that was you know

53
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:22,509
something other than just our time I

54
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,639
think once the check was written over

55
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:28,929
like two grand

56
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:30,729
we should probably sort this out but I

57
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,400
didn't pick the right lawyer the first

58
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:35,859
try that's for sure and I made plenty of

59
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,420
decisions that were bad decisions that

60
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,280
you know you would think as a lawyer but

61
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:42,579
lawyers aren't entrepreneurs I've

62
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,810
learned that through and through so you

63
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,170
know as we go through these questions

64
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:50,800
tonight I am going to share a lot of

65
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:51,969
screw-ups because I in the very

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,010
beginning when I wanted to start this

67
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:56,080
business I went to an event called

68
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:58,269
Denver startup week and it's like the

69
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,769
largest free entrepreneurial event in

70
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:01,870
the world over ten thousand people a

71
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:03,610
year plus show up and the best panel I

72
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,800
went to was called founder fuck-ups and

73
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,330
these now successful founders got on

74
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,550
stage and told everything they screwed

75
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,980
up and I like notes on things not to do

76
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,390
and hopefully I can also tell you some

77
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:17,048
lessons and things not to do now that

78
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:18,488
said we're doing really well it's okay

79
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:19,840
to make mistakes you just have to not

80
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,450
repeat them and if you can have people

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,069
tell you about mistakes that they made

82
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:27,849
and you can avoid those ones that's one

83
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:30,639
less mistake to make one thing I would

84
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:34,229
say is it's a piggyback on what Amanda

85
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:38,500
said is and maybe atriums different but

86
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:41,469
don't let lawyers run your business you

87
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,479
know that's a big that's a big one if I

88
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:48,039
did everything lawyers time we started

89
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:49,899
ArcView in 2010 right so if I did

90
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:52,629
everything lawyers told me to do for the

91
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,060
last you know in nine years we wouldn't

92
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:56,680
we wouldn't be here right so you know

93
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,349
you got to look at the risk factors you

94
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,969
got to look at what what you're doing

95
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:03,609
and understand what's that what's that

96
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:05,949
risk when you take take different

97
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,750
actions but you know particularly

98
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:09,759
because so many things can cost so much

99
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,229
now if you're able to read and maybe

100
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,569
this is what atrium is working on is if

101
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:15,159
you can lower the cost to be able to do

102
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:17,889
a lot of those things you can you can

103
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,478
protect yourself even more so and for

104
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,579
lower cost which gives you the ability

105
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:25,068
to protect yourself more

106
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:26,060
we're working on it and I hope for for

107
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:27,560
the clients that are in the crowd that

108
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:32,269
that we're doing a pretty good job so

109
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,439
far so I think the next thing I want to

110
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:35,389
sort of discuss is a little bit more

111
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,759
technical but also an important point

112
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,710
with respect to when you go to form your

113
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,050
company it's obviously a little bit

114
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:43,519
different for you know if you're in the

115
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,919
business of touching the plant versus

116
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,649
just sort of a tech company operating in

117
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:51,408
the space I just wanted to hear your

118
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:52,609
thoughts on you know from an investor's

119
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:53,750
perspective what you liked if you're

120
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,669
investing in a company that touches the

121
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,658
plants sort of like the the entity

122
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:59,478
structure that you like to see for

123
00:04:56,658 --> 00:05:00,800
example a holding company that holds a

124
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:03,468
wholly owned subsidiary that holds the

125
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,038
license and operating entity that's in

126
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:09,259
California and sort of your opinions on

127
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:13,938
sort of what you think works best under

128
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:16,750
the current regulatory scheme I can

129
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:19,610
speak to it a little bit

130
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:23,418
basically it really depends on the state

131
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:26,408
and also there our elements to where

132
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:28,519
that a lot of investors can get kind of

133
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:30,050
thrown off by a little bit because

134
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:33,968
you'll see a company come that has like

135
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:37,668
multiple LLC's in order to accomplish

136
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:40,310
certain things with 280e rules that

137
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:43,579
they're you know looking to avoid you

138
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:46,098
know looking to to be tax efficient with

139
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:48,050
with LLC's and stuff and you'll see

140
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:49,550
investors just be like whoa that just

141
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,870
looks weird they're used to seeing a

142
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:55,848
Delaware see corporate different

143
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,860
companies trying different things and

144
00:05:55,848 --> 00:06:01,218
being innovative it's very tough as an

145
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,710
investor to know you know what's okay

146
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:06,259
what's not okay how that all works and

147
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:09,168
so that's where law firms come in really

148
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:14,449
handy on both sides to really understand

149
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:15,829
that are at ArcView specifically we even

150
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,449
though we bring investors and

151
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:19,908
entrepreneurs together we're not the

152
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:22,189
ones in the deals that touch the plant

153
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:25,848
at least so far we haven't placed any

154
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:27,800
capital there so we've stayed in the

155
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:31,668
ancillary side when it comes to us

156
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,800
placing capital but we certainly see a

157
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:36,468
wide range of

158
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,999
of setups but I would not call myself an

159
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:42,558
expert on that that's why I'm on this

160
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:44,479
panel with these guys the thing I would

161
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:47,300
say when it comes to formation and

162
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,878
entity type is that you don't need to

163
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,009
necessarily plan to be one entity type

164
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:56,569
your entire life if you are planning to

165
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:57,860
go and raise on day one certainly there

166
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:00,110
are things that make more sense than

167
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,930
others but you know I have a cousin

168
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,449
that's a top VC down the valley does not

169
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,278
touch family deals but his advice to me

170
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:09,588
was I take money from early-stage

171
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:11,269
startups for a living and as your cousin

172
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:14,629
I'm going to tell you to bootstrap as

173
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:17,058
far as you can humanly bootstrap and in

174
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:19,099
doing so a different entity type made

175
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:20,899
sense for me in the early days we were

176
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:23,028
an LLC and we were able to take

177
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,129
advantage of partnership taxation and

178
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:26,718
when you're taking on losses and

179
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:29,419
bootstrapping it's a really good

180
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:32,088
structure and so it you really have to

181
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:34,639
not get set on one type once we went to

182
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:37,430
take on serious capital yes we convert

183
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,168
it into a Delaware C Corp but I have no

184
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,959
regrets about forming the way we did

185
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:44,538
because it made sense and once you make

186
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:47,718
a corporation election you can't go back

187
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:49,490
from that so easily so you know there's

188
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:52,308
no need to you have to look at what your

189
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:57,499
situation is and where you're going and

190
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:59,180
not be dead set on day one and one thing

191
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:02,088
I did for those in there I know Troi

192
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,559
touched on this idea of 280e if if

193
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:06,319
you're unaware as to what that is it's

194
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:07,669
basically something in the tax code that

195
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,050
says that if you you know traffic and

196
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:11,359
illegal drugs you don't get the benefit

197
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,218
of certain tax deductions and so if

198
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,588
you're in the cannabis business you have

199
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:17,118
to work around that and so for a lot of

200
00:08:15,588 --> 00:08:18,499
businesses in the cannabis industry it

201
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:21,259
means you don't get the benefit of your

202
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:22,669
general administrative deductions and so

203
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:24,288
you come up with these more complex

204
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:28,008
corporate structures to be able to work

205
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:29,899
around that and one other thing I wanted

206
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,908
to piggyback on what Amanda's saying and

207
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:34,158
yes the you know in the traditional text

208
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:37,818
sense the and you guys feel free to

209
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,889
correct me if I'm wrong if you you see

210
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:42,198
the you know Delaware company and it's

211
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:43,610
great for taking VC investments but for

212
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:45,109
touch the plant businesses it's not

213
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,100
always the best because for example

214
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,690
cannabis is illegal in Delaware

215
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,680
so as a result if you hip holding the

216
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,449
court there that creates a lot of

217
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,919
problems so you need to think about you

218
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:55,049
can't just go on coolly go and you know

219
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,250
use their Delaware and corporation Docs

220
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:57,569
if you're gonna be applying for a

221
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,269
license in California because that

222
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:03,028
changes sort of you know the place

223
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:05,759
you're gonna be in and the morale that

224
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:07,948
story is simply you this is where you

225
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,568

226
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:11,338

and discuss what you're trying to

228
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,639
accomplish

229

because right we're tech company and

230
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,250
many of you guys are plant touching

231
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:19,919
companies and so you have different

232
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,929
needs and that's we're trying to you

233

234
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:25,439
answers to everything tonight but these

235
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:28,588
are one of the why you have to talk to

236
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,350
your attorneys yeah I can speak to to

237
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:33,839
corporate structures meadow la reunión

238
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,230
where seek Delaware c-corporation

239
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,360
we don't touch the plant we have four

240
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,420
founders everyone's an equal shareholder

241
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,149
we have an option pool that is dedicated

242
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:48,448
to hiring talent as well as providing

243
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:51,568
advisory shares how I paid for my

244
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:54,328
initial lawyer hoister guy Doug who's

245
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:55,799
awesome was initially advisory chairs so

246
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:59,099
that can come into play if you with a

247
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:01,799
you know having a seat work my wife

248
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,319
Crete has an edible company she's a

249
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,969
c-corp in California for exactly the

250
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:09,719
same reason that you said we didn't want

251
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:13,740
a licensed entity in Delaware in case of

252
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,040
any issues you know she's a solo founder

253
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,589
but as an option pool and is taking

254
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,809
capital through a safe vehicle it's

255
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:24,000
kinda what we use as a convertible

256
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:26,669
without an expiration date without terms

257
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,509
and you know payback periods it's what

258
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:32,009
YC continually uses which I recommend

259
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:33,958
but it might not be the best for you

260
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:36,049
it's just an easy way of getting capital

261
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,929
without having to convert that equity

262
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:42,028
initially ya know those are really good

263
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,739
insights who and for all of you who

264
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:45,328
haven't heard of his wife's company it's

265
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,680
called Melos and you should 100% try

266
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:51,809
them they're fantastic so I think

267
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,328
another big step along a formation

268
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:56,309
highway is dealing with banking I know

269
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:57,539
it's gotten a lot easier but I know

270
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:59,309
Amanda had some really great stories

271
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,129
about it and you know great to hear from

272
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:02,709
you as well

273
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:04,720
on sort of any roadblocks you've you've

274
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:07,210
hit in that space and or just like how

275
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,259
you got banking services from from the

276
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:13,360
get-go oh so well as the former bank

277
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:16,120
regulator I can't really lie to bankers

278
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,610
about what I do I'm like the absolute

279
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,950
perfect target for you know I know your

280
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,060
costumer investigation what do you mean

281
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,629
you didn't know you had to tell your

282
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:27,489
banker you're a former bank regulator I

283
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:29,259
couldn't really lie so I'm day one you

284
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,930
know there was challenges with that but

285
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:34,750
I basically had to use my entire network

286
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:36,129
of banking attorneys and whatnot to find

287
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,889
a bank that would take us and we're

288
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:41,439
ancillary but we found one thankfully

289
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:44,919
and we've been with them for many years

290
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,900
but they're like most banks that want to

291
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:49,149
deal with people like us not a ginormous

292
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:51,220
bank and as such they don't have their

293
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:53,470
own merchant services so merchant

294
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:57,670
services have been really challenging

295
00:11:53,470 --> 00:12:00,580
for us over the years denials and then

296
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:02,349
having merchant services no problem for

297
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,570
two and a half years now when you're

298
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:08,639
bootstrapping a company and you pay

299
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:11,470
payroll off of revenue and come February

300
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,860
first Intuit calls you and they're like

301
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,660
hey based on who you take money from

302
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:20,289
we're cutting you off and we're not

303
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:21,789
decrypting any of the information oh and

304
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:23,139
not to mention your lawyer so of course

305
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:24,879
you're not keeping this stuff on your

306
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:26,529
personal servers you're making sure it

307
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,470
gets entered directly into the encrypted

308
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:31,720
system let's just say I had 97 accounts

309
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,759
outstanding at that point of customers

310
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,460
who I didn't have payment information

311
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,319
for and I had to make payroll this is

312
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,690
not for the faint of heart this is hard

313
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,220
stuff and that could have ended my

314
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,010
company could and did any company that

315
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,470
was bootstrapped on it I got scrappy and

316
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:49,240
I took on some consulting projects and I

317
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,570
also had a team that knew what we were

318
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,490
getting into all along so I was very

319
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,960
transparent with them but I made thirty

320
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,759
thousand dollars of consulting money

321
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,700
show up in about seven days and I paid

322
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,139
payroll and I called everybody I knew

323
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,670
and got a million rejections everyone's

324
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:04,750
like oh yeah well you're an Slayer we'll

325
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:07,120
be able to get you a bank account it was

326
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,440
all around the Jeff Sessions scares at

327
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,600
the time

328
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,130
eventually I got it done and I never

329
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,600
thought I would jump up and down for a

330
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:18,429
6.9% hate and then eventually we found

331
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,580
one at 5.9 and now we're back into the

332
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:23,679
twos but to say the least save as much

333
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:27,490
money his you humanly can it's not the

334
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:29,969
in case fund it's the when fund and

335
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:35,250
again it's not for the faint of heart

336
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:37,660
but we survived that one too yeah

337
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,990
getting it back in count is difficult if

338
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:43,029
you're a licensed entity I'm just I

339
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,080
think what we've also seen is all the

340
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:46,870
structures where there's a holding

341
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,550
company so you know that's kind of my

342
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,429
advice it's more about creating a

343
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:56,829
holding company that manages the payroll

344
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:58,629
or expenses for businesses that you know

345
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,430
that allows you a little bit more

346
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,559
distance from it

347
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:04,899
and that's where you kind of run a lot

348
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,869
of your your your payroll and expenses

349
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:09,970
so if you go the route of just saying

350
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:15,700
what you do you're gonna get denied just

351
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:19,050
Sam the biggest advice I would have on

352
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:22,840
this is to have multiple bank accounts I

353
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:24,399
got caught once not having another bank

354
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,960
account lined up and I'll never have

355
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,259
that happen again we almost weren't able

356
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,370
to make payroll and it was really it was

357
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:32,049
one of those things where they're like

358
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,580
we're gonna send you the money they're

359
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:36,159
gonna kick us they're kicking us out and

360
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,139
they're gonna send us the money but we

361
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,730
if we take it out by this day we can

362
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:41,169
actually have it to be able to open up

363
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,330
the other account otherwise you'd have

364
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:45,429
to wait like 15 days or something for

365
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:48,460
this cheque to come to then goes but I

366
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:50,799
had like a lot of bills during that time

367
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:55,410
I was like oh no I can't not pay people

368
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:58,389
so but we got right under the wire and

369
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:59,679
now you look back you laugh at a so we

370
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:01,539
got through it you know those were the

371
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:05,679
good old days or whatever right but no

372
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:08,289
don't have multiple bank accounts even

373
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,879
when the bank says oh yeah no it's

374
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:14,889
totally cool we're allowed to work with

375
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:17,950
cannabis companies every bank we've ever

376
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:19,689
been in has told well except for one has

377
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,480
told us that they're totally cool with

378
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,940
cannabis

379
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,589
because we're ancillary but the way

380
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,110
these banks work is they've got their

381
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:28,940
regulatory Department and a lot of times

382
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,220
it doesn't go all the way up there or

383
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,199
somebody from the regulatory department

384
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,910
does give ok but then a banking

385
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,309
regulator comes in and starts giving

386
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:40,370
them a hard time and then they have to

387
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:44,239
go back on their word and so this is

388
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:46,070
happens like a domino and so have

389
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,329
multiple accounts so when one Falls you

390
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,320
got another one and then when that one

391
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:53,000
Falls you get a new one

392
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,250
right it's getting easier it's you know

393
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,850
I think it's you can get a bank account

394
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,589
now but it takes work and sometimes it's

395
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,480
not always the best banks and sometimes

396
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:04,970
they want to charge you a lot of money

397
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,769
to bank with them which usually goes the

398
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,079
other way around in banking but not

399
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:11,778
anymore not with cannabis so there's

400
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:13,819
these different pieces of it but it's a

401
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:17,299
lot better than it was a few years ago

402
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:22,459
and I have a good sense that banking

403
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:25,250
will get resolved very very shortly I'm

404
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:26,778
hopeful too when when we went down to

405
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,578
that six point nine and that five point

406
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,559
nine and down to twos we still run

407
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:32,629
certain transactions and swallow the

408
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,489
extra fees and run things in that six

409
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:36,470
point nine in that five point nine every

410
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,480
month because we still need those guys

411
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,240
to be there in case we lose one of the

412
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,720
other ones also we changed our name

413
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,519
corporate wise like we we don't need to

414
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,819
have kin in our name and neither do you

415
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:53,209
you don't need green Verde virtus any

416
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:57,379
iteration of bloom Farms flowers

417
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:58,969
whatever and you know we have multiple

418
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:01,519
reasons why we changed our name to regs

419
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,019
technology but our company and our

420
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,699
project are very much kin of eggs and

421
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:06,650
we're very transparent with our bank and

422
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,029
her bank thankfully has always been on

423
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,919
our side so they opened us the regs

424
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:11,629
technology account the data probably

425
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,880
haven't they they they're VPS were

426
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:17,179
trying to get us merchant services as

427
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,490
well so just keep those things out of

428
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:22,309
your name to make yourself and your life

429
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:25,640
less painful sweet I think that was

430
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:27,439
tremendously helpful for everybody so

431
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,190
let's move on to sort of structuring the

432
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,940
founding team how like what

433
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,490
recommendations would you have into

434
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,660
of from you know the investors

435
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,130
perspective as to what you like to see

436
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,200
in terms of the equity split leaving

437
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,270
room for you know future VC money to

438
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,039
maybe come in to making sure your

439
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,809
founder team is founding team is

440
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,029
everybody's properly incentivized maybe

441
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:50,970
on similar terms nobody feels slighted

442
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:52,920
for example I don't sure you want to

443
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:56,130
start first yeah I mean it really

444
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:59,190
depends on what at what stage you're

445
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:01,350
investing into a company and also every

446
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,330
company is totally different in terms of

447
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:06,689
the incentives and and and things like

448
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:08,699
that I would say I mean this kind of

449
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,160
gets a little bit into value what you

450
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,960
can't talk about yeah we can talk about

451
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,269
valuation cuz that's really important we

452
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,029
wait on that a little later but I mean

453
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:20,910
yeah let's just assume you know seed

454
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,779
stage companies right really early maybe

455
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,740
just starting to go through the

456
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:24,899
licensing process at the beginning

457
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,059
founding team just kind of well I mean

458
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,769
in terms of what what what I would look

459
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,089
for in a founding team or like

460
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:30,569
structures I think I think that's

461
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:32,159
helpful

462
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,720
okay and then maybe just the proper

463
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,060
vesting at a minimum that you like to

464
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,160
see all right oh got it right yeah one

465
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:40,169
of the mistakes a lot of people make is

466
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,880
they get a group of four people and they

467
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:45,000
split up all the equity and then they go

468
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,650
out to the and then like what four

469
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,869
people stays together

470
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:52,019
for I mean like it's really rare and

471
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:54,750
really rare and very few people actually

472
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:58,109
think to do to actually have everybody

473
00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,809
vest or to think about what happens if

474
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:02,309
somebody doesn't work out or if one

475
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,980
person put some more energy than the

476
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:07,409
other so that's that's super important

477
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:11,430
and one of the key reasons to be talking

478
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:15,509
to a lawyer early on as well to have

479
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:17,190
that so that's one thing to be really

480
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:19,349
that's probably the biggest thing I'll

481
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,240
leave I'll leave that one ever would I

482
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:22,319
know you had some stuff to comment on

483
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,779
this when we were talking before this

484
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:30,210
panel just said no founder equity yeah

485
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:32,129
so it's myself and three other

486
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:36,090
co-founders in a meadow there's four of

487
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,800
us we split up equity equally I think

488
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:40,199
that was important we all vested at the

489
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:42,119
same time as well we left enough for

490
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,549
investors that were not issued and we

491
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:45,928
had an option pool I think one thing

492
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:48,509
that we've done

493
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:50,909
is you know when we made the decision to

494
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:53,058
do this you're really getting into

495
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:55,769
marriage I think I don't know if

496
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:57,118
someone's gonna leave maybe but you know

497
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:59,868
we kind of committed that we're gonna do

498
00:19:57,118 --> 00:20:03,028
this thing all the way through and I

499
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:05,249
think when you you kind of commit to

500
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:06,868
that you have to be able to think if

501
00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:09,690
you're gonna be with this person how

502
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:12,418
they complement you how do they make the

503
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,340
product better or the team better we

504
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,139
ended up creating a set of values as

505
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:18,148
well to pull from and kind of like help

506
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:20,158
direct the the moral compass of the

507
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:22,589
company I think that's quite important

508
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,970
and then you know once you formulate

509
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:25,769
your founding team

510
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,110
it is like marriage you do need to check

511
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:32,190
in you can't just let them go off and

512
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:34,288
kind of gallivanting around it's about

513
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,909
checking in we do it every week we have

514
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:38,849
a founders meeting every week at the

515
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:40,889
same time if we miss it that dates the

516
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:43,349
scheduled the next day and that's where

517
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:45,298
we talk about what's again what's

518
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:47,998
happening what well what could be better

519
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:51,298
and bring up any other things that you

520
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:56,850
know could bubble up if it left too long

521
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:58,408
unattended one another you another story

522
00:20:56,849 --> 00:21:01,980
I know you had a good story that you

523
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:05,309
wanted founder mess-ups so when I

524
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,319
started this and I was co-founding with

525
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:09,599
a you know an attorney who'd been a

526
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:11,278
mentor of mine so of course you know I

527
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,158
looked up to him and I had trusted him

528
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:16,019
and had 20 years of practice on me so

529
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,090
when the attorney we used suggested

530
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:19,798
vesting periods and he convinced me why

531
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:22,798
we didn't need them you know that was

532
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:24,898
mistake number one so I had a co-founder

533
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:28,138
that you know he had maybe five percent

534
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:30,118
less than me and you know it started

535
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:31,918
with okay well I'm the older attorney

536
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:35,128
who knows how to do stuff I'll I'll turn

537
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,869
the need be layaway is hard you try and

538
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:39,418
eventually I did everything and he did

539
00:21:36,868 --> 00:21:42,569
nothing and then he got a day job that

540
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:44,970
doubled his day job salary and I was

541
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:46,470
left with an extremely toxic cap table I

542
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,618
did everything myself and I had a guy

543
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:51,569
that owned nearly 40% of the company and

544
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:53,099
I was pretty much done fundable I

545
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:55,168
eventually was able to raise a

546
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:57,449
convertible note to buy him out and I I

547
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:58,540
mean by far and away if all the

548
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,970
negotiations I've done

549
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:02,829
the entirety of this company it was the

550
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,360
one with this man that led to more

551
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:07,240
yelling fights screaming matches

552
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:09,250
painfulness and threats that I've ever I

553
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,380
mean I basically had to threaten at one

554
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,880
point I'll burn it down and build it

555
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,400
again if you don't take this money and

556
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,700
go away I got it done

557
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,200
spare yourself sounds like moral the

558
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,470
story is make sure everybody testing

559
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:26,710
periods for everyone okay I think we got

560
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,509
it I think to wrap up sort of the whole

561
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,980
formation discussion so we can move into

562
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:32,890
fine fundraising which I think everybody

563
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:35,349
is probably really interested about any

564
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:37,900
big sort of regulatory blockers that you

565
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:39,429
ran into outside of baking obviously

566
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:45,970
just when you're starting your company

567
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:48,519
and and how you worked around that when

568
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,850
we can't came out of YC our product was

569
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:53,079
really around like an uber for wheat

570
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:56,259
meadow would really facilitate

571
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:59,439
deliveries between delivery operators

572
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:02,079
and consumers and as we started moving

573
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,180
forward in the regulatory process it

574
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,569
wasn't clear to us whether delivery

575
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:10,509
would survive we advocated for it we

576
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:12,189
created trade groups around it we you

577
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:15,910
know fought at a local level to issue

578
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:18,130
licensing and all that but we had to

579
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,200
make a decision on seeing what license

580
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:23,590
types would survive and that was an

581
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,539
evolution into retail point of sale and

582
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:28,539
I think as you look at your business

583
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:31,240
models the regulations are so important

584
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:33,909
because any model can be written out or

585
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,339
written in to the regs thankfully we did

586
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:40,390
get a type 9 license and delivery exist

587
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:42,250
today unfortunately 67% of the state

588
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:45,910
didn't have any local laws and it was

589
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:47,710
prohibited and now we have another set

590
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:51,550
of regulations as perhaps allowing

591
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:54,970
statewide delivery and so I think

592
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:56,139
overall it's if you're not reading the

593
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,660
regs and reading the playbook and

594
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:01,270
understanding how this is going to come

595
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,980
down the pipeline then you know you may

596
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:06,279
find yourself in an obsolete business

597
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:09,579
model come the next session and you know

598
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:11,619
the way I get around that or help get up

599
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:12,849
that curve is really surround yourself

600
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:14,919
with great people

601
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:17,679
you know obviously joint trade

602
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,360
organizations they they really helped I

603
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,009
mean they advocate but they keep you in

604
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,240
the loop you can't help but go to a

605
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:27,009
meeting and just start talking about

606
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:30,250
regs it's what we do it's what we do you

607
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:31,629
don't like it in the wrong industry but

608
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:40,869
yeah I think that's really important to

609
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:44,460
think about in in 2011 I think it was we

610
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:47,919
had just started me and Steve DeAngelo

611
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,779
went into business for to start ArcView

612
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,850
and he was our first investor and

613
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:54,670
everything was going great we were high

614
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:58,689
on this idea of Obama had come out and

615
00:24:54,670 --> 00:25:02,200
said they was gonna allow states to to

616
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,880
to do their own thing and the Attorney

617
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,309
General was in favor everything was

618
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:11,080
wonderful and then all of a sudden he

619
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:14,200
changed his mind and had this company

620
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:17,470
that was bringing investors and

621
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:20,799
entrepreneurs together and doing all of

622
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:23,200
this great stuff and all of a sudden in

623
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,940
like mid 2011 nobody wanted to do

624
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,920
business at all like people didn't want

625
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,660
to come to our events anymore

626
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,580
and it was still early enough so there

627
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,680
wasn't enough momentum really to like

628
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:35,759
kind of be like yeah whatever and like

629
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:39,490
like what happened a few few months ago

630
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:43,180
but it was so small at that time that it

631
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:46,839
really did cut it off and so believe it

632
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:50,140
or not I wound up we had no money but I

633
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:52,599
was so committed to it that I kept at it

634
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,940
and had to decide whether I wanted a

635
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:57,339
social life or a home and I decided a

636
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:00,220
social life and I lived in my car and in

637
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:03,309
friends couches for about six or seven

638
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:06,430
months during that time so that was one

639
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:10,509
regulatory hurdle we ran into and found

640
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:14,529
our way through thank you those are some

641
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:16,420
really good insights so one actually

642
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:19,149
last topic before we move into fundraise

643
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,980
is that a joint yes I've never been on a

644
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,179
panel with a joint this is a shortage

645
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,759
this is amazing

646
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:42,249
imagine I'm excited any Lea's left-hand

647
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:44,519
side so I go first it's all about

648
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:47,259
community at the end of the day it's not

649
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,999
I am NOT gonna be stoned while I'm on

650
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:54,819
this I don't want it to be like a bad

651
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:57,100
after-school special I'm good it's a

652
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:59,648
banana breath from a Humboldt farm

653
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:01,569
called Debbie that's result this is

654
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:09,158
Davey's friend's farm right yeah yeah

655
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:12,220
nice thanks Davey so I've actually never

656
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:13,990
I've never been high while on a panel

657
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,759
ever before well then maybe I should try

658
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:18,730
and eat right now now we're not not with

659
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,378
a bunch of lawyers you kidding me I'm a

660
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:25,839
lawyer and I did it so I think that kind

661
00:27:20,378 --> 00:27:29,079
of all right let's move on to better

662
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:32,398
things like fundraising all right all

663
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:35,199
right so I figured we would start with

664
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:37,239
three series eight companies so maybe

665
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,740
you know you've gone you form your

666
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,128
company founding teams together maybe

667
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:44,950
done your first key hires issued some

668
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:46,148
equity and maybe you've gone through a

669
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:50,048
licensing process or you're in the

670
00:27:46,148 --> 00:27:51,579
middle of a licensing process what what

671
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:53,349
does that order of operations look like

672
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:54,730
in terms of I shouldn't say order of

673
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:56,618
operations but what would be the the

674
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,089
preferred financing vehicle that you

675
00:27:56,618 --> 00:27:59,918
guys generally see for seed stage

676
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:01,118
companies I know we get founders that

677
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,559
come in the door and like oh I want to

678
00:28:01,118 --> 00:28:04,359
do a price round because it's so much

679
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:05,940
cleaner on my cap table but you know

680
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:08,258
sometimes the only raising like 500k and

681
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:11,288
transaction costs might not be worth it

682
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:13,749
it's really hard to value a company in

683
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:14,859
those early days is very very hard to do

684
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:18,159
it so that's why we see a lot of

685
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:20,709
convertible notes and safes in in those

686
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,778
areas and then also you know for if

687
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,879
you're pre-license and this really

688
00:28:22,778 --> 00:28:28,240
depends on the state a little different

689
00:28:24,878 --> 00:28:29,589
in California but if there's a chance

690
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,240
you're not going to get your license

691
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:36,538
it's really hard to raise money

692
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,880
that's that's changed a little bit with

693
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:41,038
what's happening in the in Canada with

694
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,010
the with the markets going crazy cuz now

695
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:46,200
with the way that they're buying these

696
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:49,440
these companies up there are now

697
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,288
investors who are like alright I'll take

698
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,048
I'll take a swing on on the chance of

699
00:28:52,288 --> 00:28:58,220
getting a license in ways that they

700
00:28:55,048 --> 00:29:04,889
haven't before because of that arbitrage

701
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:06,450
opportunity there but yeah that's what I

702
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,130
would say unless that's how no III

703
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,538
completely agree and I know you know I'm

704
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:12,240
and I know you've done convertible notes

705
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:13,500
who saves convertible notes from from

706
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,390
your perspective of your seed stage

707
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,769
company I mean even if you're raising a

708
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,450
few million dollars does it really make

709
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:20,250
sense to a price around at that point or

710
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:25,740
from simplicity as like a founder would

711
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:27,390
would you prefer to it depends I mean

712
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:32,640
can I give him more lawyerly answer but

713
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:34,950
I mean we're I mean it depends on who

714
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,049
you are and what your appetite is for

715
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,840
certain things like I had done

716
00:29:37,048 --> 00:29:43,408
convertible debt and I converted that

717
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:47,099
and were pretty close to closing our

718
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:48,630
Series A and we did price it I didn't

719
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:49,980
want to operate with debt but there's a

720
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,778
lot of benefits to operating with debt

721
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,509
and and simultaneously ended up taking

722
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:56,609
on a I was swor going into it that I was

723
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:58,769
gonna not take any debt in this round

724
00:29:56,609 --> 00:30:03,269
but I ended up taking a line of credit

725
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:05,190
to I was like okay so there's so many

726
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:08,879
pros and cons to it it's really just

727
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:09,960
depends on you as a company and what

728
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,049
you're trying to accomplish in your

729
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,750
appetite for different things yeah I'm a

730
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:18,240
huge fan of the safe you know not gonna

731
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,398
lie I think it really helps bring down

732
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,500
the cost of compliance but bring down

733
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,689
the cost of getting a lawyer to review

734
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,119
documents it standardizes everything for

735
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,679
everybody right no investors trying to

736
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,538
put their stake in the ground and saying

737
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,788
giving you specific terms and dictating

738
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:35,308
what you need to do or anything like

739
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:38,099
that we raised over two and a half

740
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:40,558
million dollars on safes we have over 40

741
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:42,359
different investors we didn't have a

742
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,548
discount but you could provide a

743
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:46,250
discount basically people that get in

744
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:48,170
early he can be discount on the round

745
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,789
you can price it pricing it as

746
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,590
evaluation which Troy's talking about

747
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:53,539
that's a little bit more of a dance but

748
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:56,720
in the early days it's more art than

749
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:59,240
science so make sure your narrative is

750
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,650
very compelling if you need more

751
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,900
information about creating a compelling

752
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,690
narrative Justin Kahn of founder of

753
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:08,630
atrium has a great blog post on it it is

754
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,170
what sells the dream and it what is what

755
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:13,130
sells

756
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:16,400
you know the investors in to get it one

757
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:18,620
thing though to be cognizant of on safes

758
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,780
you can do a Most Favoured Nation so

759
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:22,759
early people there is no valuation

760
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:24,740
whatever valuation comes down the pipe

761
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:27,289
that's the first one that they get

762
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,859
whichever best terms so you could do

763
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:31,909
that as well

764
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:34,369
and then I think you know you can go

765
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:37,730
pretty long on safes but you have to be

766
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:39,859
very cognizant on dilution and what

767
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:42,230
happens when that equity when that safe

768
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:44,179
converts to equity and why be mean by

769
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:47,420
that is you have an assistant pool of

770
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:49,730
equity that you sold in in that note and

771
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:52,400
that safe and when your equity converts

772
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:54,440
that whole piece shifts into the cap

773
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,420
table and the percentage is that you

774
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,980
thought you owned get diluted down

775
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,980
because now people are getting the

776
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:05,089
equity that they have paid you know for

777
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:08,240
via that safe model and if you're not

778
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:10,459
careful you can over sell your company

779
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,259
on safes and an equity conversion comes

780
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,269
and everyone looks around and doesn't

781
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:17,660
have as much as they owned before and it

782
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:19,609
can get pretty demoralizing and so quick

783
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,600
primer then for those who don't know the

784
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:22,879
difference between is safe and a

785
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:24,259
convertible note a safe is on its on his

786
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,520
face is very similar to a convertible

787
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:28,220
note but the really the big difference

788
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,379
is safes don't have interest or maturity

789
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,089
date and there are a little bit more

790
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:37,810
bare bones on you know some more low

791
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:40,490
early jargon terms but yeah so I think

792
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:45,970
it's super quick you can get money

793
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,970
quickly money fast I guess all right

794
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:49,879
well one thing that they were talking

795
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:53,990
about is dilutions and company

796
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,250
valuations I know some pitch book data

797
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,740
came out I don't I don't know people

798
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,700
sort of follow pitch book but Troy and I

799
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,019
were actually talking about this before

800
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,549
the panel and

801
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:04,549
and so the average pre-money valuation

802
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:07,308
of a tech company was around I believe

803
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:08,960
eight million pre-money and then average

804
00:33:07,308 --> 00:33:10,910
you know size of a seed round was about

805
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,289
two million so then that brings us your

806
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:15,440
post money roughly to about ten million

807
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:16,490
so in the cannabis space are we seeing

808
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,320
something similar I know you mentioned

809
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,789
there's a difference between it founders

810
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:23,058
think you know it's a premium versus a

811
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:25,369
discount and you know let's hear more I

812
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:27,769
think that we're not seeing that at

813
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:29,779
least with at least with you know you

814
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:31,429
might see that with limited licenses and

815
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:33,319
stuff and some of the some of the states

816
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:34,880
are if you know you're in a town where

817
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:36,619
that only has a few licenses or

818
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,780
something like that then you can start

819
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:41,029
to see really high valuations early on

820
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:42,889
but for everybody else and everything

821
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:44,779
I've seen coming through we are not

822
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:48,200
seeing eight million dollar pre-money

823
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:50,329
seed rounds even even as things have

824
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,308
started to go up I mean this is just a

825
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:53,689
much more nascent industry and then

826
00:33:52,308 --> 00:33:56,000
there's the big question as to whether

827
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:59,480
or not cannabis gets a premium or

828
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,720
whether it gets a discount if you're an

829
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,549
entrepreneur it definitely has a premium

830
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,990
right definitely

831
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:08,449
right this is the hottest industry in

832
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:11,269
the world it's growing at 27% compound

833
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:13,009
annual growth rate look at it 66% public

834
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:15,259
support this stuff is changing get on

835
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:23,090
the bandwagon we're gonna win right now

836
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:25,310
if you're an investor if you're an

837
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:28,250
investor it's really it's it's it's

838
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:30,259
often the other perspective where people

839
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,719
are saying well this is you know this is

840
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,520
the the the funding ecosystem isn't

841
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,709
there you know we don't we don't we're

842
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:39,320
not seeing the the funding ecosystem

843
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:43,240
fill its fill itself out who's gonna be

844
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,950
the the next round of funding on this

845
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:48,019
what are all the risks of the regulatory

846
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,269
risks I mean a regulator wakes up one

847
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:54,050
day and decides you know they're not

848
00:34:50,269 --> 00:34:56,179
gonna allow delivery what happens these

849
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,310
are kinds we they can point to thousands

850
00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:00,320
of examples all across the country of

851
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:03,190
examples where entire businesses were

852
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,019
wiped out from a regulatory change

853
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:09,230
including ancillary businesses and so

854
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:10,940
there's a lot of pressure from investors

855
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,820
to say look there's a lot of ways to

856
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,639
make money

857
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:18,760
and so if I'm coming into the cannabis

858
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:21,429
sector do I want to pay a premium or or

859
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:25,150
a or a discount because of the added

860
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:27,369
risks associated with that I do think

861
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:30,309
that that story is changing I think

862
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:32,739
we're seeing that change a little bit in

863
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:35,590
the last few months like literally like

864
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:37,479
since like you know two three months ago

865
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:39,130
I think we're starting to see that

866
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,150
narrative change and I think there are

867
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:47,500
more investors willing to pay a premium

868
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:49,420
but the the bar for how good a company

869
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,340
needs to be in order to get that and

870
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,039
what their path needs to be is changed

871
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:55,990
as well because if you go back six

872
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:57,820
months or even a year there are very few

873
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:59,859
people who would say that they thought

874
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:04,480
federal prohibition was gonna end in the

875
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:07,870
next two years very few people now there

876
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,559
is almost a consensus starting to brew

877
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:13,839
that by 2020 we will see very very

878
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:19,090
meaningful federal reform that will in

879
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:22,030
effect be legalization and that has

880
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:25,390
changed the trajectory of most companies

881
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:27,880
in terms of what your path is in a in a

882
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:32,079
world where where all the big dogs are

883
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:34,269
here and every major company that has a

884
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,000
solution is gonna want to be in the

885
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:37,989
space are you a builder you'll buy there

886
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,840
they're gonna they're gonna they're

887
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:42,489
gonna they just gonna build it

888
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,140
themselves or they gonna buy you and are

889
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:46,239
you gonna be far enough along when that

890
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:47,769
happens in order for you to be in the

891
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:49,569
mix for that buyout

892
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:53,289
or if to be able to compete with them

893
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:55,539
etc so the whole calculus has really

894
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:59,769
changed in the last three to four months

895
00:36:55,539 --> 00:37:03,070
and we're starting to see some of that

896
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:06,699
premium in conjunction with that so and

897
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:08,350
I think that's that's great I think one

898
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:10,299
other question I want to get to you

899
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:11,710
before we wrap up that I think there's a

900
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,019
lot of first-time founders here is just

901
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:15,880
you're in the cannabis space a lot of

902
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:17,949
the best pool is obviously seemingly

903
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,440
smaller one how do you identify

904
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:22,029
investors how do you approach them you

905
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,440
talk to them in sort of what's that

906
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,720
order of operations to getting that

907
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,159
first term sheet or dollar in the door

908
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:29,169
it's friends and family money or more

909
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,299
formal you know feces that are active in

910
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:37,360
the space it wants to take this one

911
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:39,310
first we were fortunate to go through Y

912
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,860
Combinator and so we pitched at demo day

913
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:45,489
and we got introduced to 600 investors

914
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:50,050
but before that my first pictures at

915
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:52,569
ArcView and props to to ArcView for

916
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:57,240
setting that up which ended up we didn't

917
00:37:52,570 --> 00:38:00,640
raise money there this is Vegas 2014 and

918
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:02,829
but I got introduced to my mentors Emily

919
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:06,599
from Emily Morgan for poseidon asset

920
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:09,009
management who eventually invested later

921
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,589
but I think it was really about putting

922
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:14,320
yourself out there and meeting different

923
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,850
people being present not just like lobby

924
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,410
conning you can't just go to every

925
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:21,940
conference like got to build your

926
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:23,349
business what you don't blog econ like

927
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,599
don't buy a ticket to the event just

928
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:27,130
hang out the lobby everyone else we're

929
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,139
outside in the smoke circle just bring

930
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:36,430
some good if I see you outside work for

931
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:41,949
you but don't spend your precious

932
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:46,059
diamond oh there are ways the hack

933
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:48,099
that's you but anyway so that's one area

934
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:50,110
you go you speak with people you know

935
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:51,969
people like Justin over there that just

936
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,289
came he's looking at invest in you

937
00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:55,259
should hit him up I'm not sure why he's

938
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:57,759
investing in but I know he's an investor

939
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,410
and then the other area is looking

940
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,480
online AngelList

941
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:04,179
is a really good area of seeing who's

942
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,280
invested in other companies CrunchBase

943
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:08,529
is also pretty good most of the time

944
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,150
you're gonna get funds but if you drill

945
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:12,160
down you can see kind of who's

946
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,170
participated or what other deals they've

947
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:16,119
participated in you can you can really

948
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,639
see the whole history of what someone's

949
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:20,739
doing and then you have the idea

950
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,150
syndicates so if you have like the

951
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:24,189
ability of getting people together they

952
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:26,170
can form a syndicate invest in you

953
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,849
and now all the crowdfunding so you

954
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:31,030
could do you know something on seed

955
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:32,739
invest or we funder I'm not sure if

956
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:34,720
they're doing cannabis so republic o

957
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:36,159
some of these platforms that allow you

958
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:38,619
to have your friends and family your

959
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,250
neighbors all put in money too but you

960
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:41,980
need to have

961
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:44,199
of the narrative the narrative super

962
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,900
important and you need to have a big

963
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:49,119
dream especially you're doing like VC

964
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,829
money if you're doing VC money you have

965
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,289
to understand that their economics is a

966
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:55,000
hit out of the Grand Slam ballpark you

967
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:56,440
know they want big returns if you're

968
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,840
pitching angels if you're pitching

969
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:02,679
smaller funds they may not have those

970
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:05,230
high aspirational value targets and

971
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:07,509
that's why it's as you're researching

972
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,490
the investor you want to research the

973
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:11,080
sector that they're investing in the

974
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:13,179
stage that they're investing in and

975
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:15,039
their typical cheque sizes and as you

976
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:18,309
have more of these conversations you can

977
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:20,320
start layer in your pipeline and do the

978
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:22,690
dance because raising money is a dance

979
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,880
it's like your spot shows birds and the

980
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:26,889
peacocking thing like one dances over

981
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,079
here and one dances over there it's

982
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:33,759
totally like that you need to reject

983
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,319
confidence and the ability of executing

984
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,200
on your vision but you need to also be

985
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:41,500
humble enough to understand that they

986
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:43,929
could help you you know move forward and

987
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:47,739
have enough friends that you pitched

988
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:49,389
along the way so that your narrative and

989
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:52,119
the way you explain it and the questions

990
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:53,500
that come up you're ready to just spit

991
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,269
off of everything you should know

992
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:59,440
everything if you don't you're going to

993
00:40:55,269 --> 00:41:01,869
get back to them and you do and I'll

994
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,300
just add everywhere you go it's

995
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:06,819
networking be it the conference be it on

996
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,100
the stage of ArcView you never know when

997
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:12,910
those people are going to come back in

998
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:16,029
and around of your life and I flat out

999
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:18,849
I've been told no many times and it's it

1000
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:22,240
I just say no for now that's K okay

1001
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:27,099
sucks in a bit but big fun we just

1002
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:30,159
closed was a flat no in May and now

1003
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:31,900
they're big yes so one thing to know is

1004
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,509
that keep them updated on your progress

1005
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:36,519
and keep them updated when new things

1006
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:39,340
come about because somebody who's in

1007
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:42,309
know today or know in may might be a yes

1008
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,890
in December and you know a lot of people

1009
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:46,869
are going to be a no forever but

1010
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:48,159
continue to meet new people and come

1011
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:50,109
back around to the ones that weren't

1012
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,759
interested with those who are interested

1013
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:55,309
because let's be frank cumin or

1014
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,770
or definitely you know bandwagon in

1015
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:59,239
general and so once somebody takes

1016
00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:02,000
interest that they respect they might

1017
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:03,589
start to take interest too and so be

1018
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,789
cognizant wherever you are you never

1019
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:08,900
know it might be on the chairlift in

1020
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:10,340
Aspen and it could be you'd be amazed

1021
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,200
where you'll meet your investors and

1022
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,570
I've definitely you know one of our

1023
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:16,759
investors we met on your small event in

1024
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:19,160
New York when you're doing the local

1025
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,950
town one so it can be anywhere talk to

1026
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:24,649
everyone in anyone thanks you want to

1027
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:27,169
finish this up sure sure well I think

1028
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,760
with raising money for cannabis

1029
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,639
companies there's a bit of a signal

1030
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:34,690
verse verse noise issue which is that

1031
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:38,359
everybody wants to talk about weed

1032
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:41,480
everybody it seems you know if you're

1033
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:46,070
talking to somebody like everybody will

1034
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:48,099
take a meeting but being able to figure

1035
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:52,519
out who will actually write a check is

1036
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:55,190
another project altogether and for

1037
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:58,250
people who've raised money in other for

1038
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,990
other businesses it's like you know

1039
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:02,989
we're just getting somebody to like take

1040
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:05,750
a look at your whatever right is like

1041
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:09,469
hard to do and then this everybody will

1042
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:11,900
take a look at it and then and then when

1043
00:43:09,469 --> 00:43:13,669
you're when you're with investors that

1044
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,500
are specific to cannabis one of the

1045
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,940
biggest mistakes I see people do that

1046
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,250
you know somebody who's a dedicated

1047
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,599
cannabis investor they've made plenty of

1048
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,590
bets in the cannabis sector and then

1049
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:23,750
they're looking at you and then the

1050
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:25,640
first thing that entrepreneurs will do

1051
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,889
will start going through the growth

1052
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:29,929
charts of like how the markets gonna

1053
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:32,809
gonna grow and all this kind of stuff

1054
00:43:29,929 --> 00:43:35,119
it's like don't waste your time on they

1055
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:37,219
already in they're already in talk about

1056
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,049
your solution talk about your team talk

1057
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:42,109
about you know so you got an arc your

1058
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:44,269
your perspective differently but I think

1059
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:47,059
that a lot of people put a lot of

1060
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:49,219
attention into their pitch and of course

1061
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:50,779
at ArcView that's the whole idea right

1062
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:53,659
it's a pigeon so people put so much

1063
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:57,350
attention into their pitch and the pitch

1064
00:43:53,659 --> 00:44:00,440
is a very small piece of the puzzle it's

1065
00:43:57,349 --> 00:44:03,170
it is important but it's also about

1066
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,260
follow up follow up follow up because

1067
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,480
life starts

1068
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,280
and people see lots of things that they

1069
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,039
like you gotta figure out how to keep

1070
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:13,140
people interested over the long haul and

1071
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:17,519
that means you got to develop a

1072
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:18,929
relationship so many I see a lot of

1073
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,239
entrepreneurs that are just sort of like

1074
00:44:18,929 --> 00:44:22,230
constantly pitching like they oh you're

1075
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:25,649
an investor oh let me tell you about

1076
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:28,559
mother you know like and it's just like

1077
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:30,660
whoa whoa whoa whoa human I mean hello

1078
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,239
okay like and I one thing I always want

1079
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:36,598
to remind people is that this is a peer

1080
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:38,909
it's a it is a peer-to-peer relationship

1081
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:40,950
and some entrepreneurs go out there and

1082
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:43,858
it's like it's like a scene out of like

1083
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:46,799
Oliver they're like you know and then

1084
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:49,980
and then and then and then some

1085
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,289
investors are like the opposite they're

1086
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:55,199
like walking or like you know like like

1087
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:57,449
got their suspenders and like you know

1088
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,009
they're like they look down on on on

1089
00:44:57,449 --> 00:45:01,949
folks or like pepper them with like

1090
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:03,300
really big questions or whatever and

1091
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,549
then are sitting back kind of like oh

1092
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:08,700
they have all the cards that's not how

1093
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:11,068
it is it's just not how it is any deal

1094
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:13,799
that happens is gonna happen because

1095
00:45:11,068 --> 00:45:16,670
there's an even trade because that

1096
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:20,460
investor needs you that investor needs

1097
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:23,400
and and a company that they can get

1098
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:25,318
behind that can help make them money and

1099
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,450
also in a lot of cases is more than

1100
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:29,509
money it's about making it's about them

1101
00:45:27,449 --> 00:45:32,219
feeling like they're having an impact

1102
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:34,770
and a bunch of other things that come

1103
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:37,980
with why somebody backs particularly a

1104
00:45:34,769 --> 00:45:41,159
seed or early-stage company often has to

1105
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:44,000
do with a lot more than the tangibles of

1106
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:46,368
money a lot of intangibles and so

1107
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,769
realizing that this is a peer

1108
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:51,780
relationship and how would you speak to

1109
00:45:49,769 --> 00:45:56,219
appear that you wanted to build a

1110
00:45:51,780 --> 00:46:02,069
long-term relationship with you would

1111
00:45:56,219 --> 00:46:03,419
act in a way that was confident and

1112
00:46:02,068 --> 00:46:05,068
assertive and would you would ask

1113
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,690
questions you would ask questions of

1114
00:46:05,068 --> 00:46:07,829
them what are you into what do you what

1115
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,630
do you do what do you do besides

1116
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:11,519
investing in cannabis right I mean

1117
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:14,099
there's a whole host of other things

1118
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,909
because when you work with an investor

1119
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:17,680
it's a long-term

1120
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:21,219
thing it's not just about getting that

1121
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:23,379
investment it's about building and being

1122
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:26,199
able to enlist their support over time

1123
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,519
as well so that's what I would say about

1124
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:30,159
that thank you

1125
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,989
I think we are out of time in terms of

1126
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:34,899
additional questions but are there any

1127
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:40,538
questions from the crowd that we didn't

1128
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:43,869
answer take 5 minutes or so the question

1129
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:45,760
was which bank which bank actually I say

1130
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:49,869
don't even know at this point my CFO

1131
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,700
handles it my banks in Colorado there

1132
00:46:49,869 --> 00:46:53,619
called Alpine but they don't touch plant

1133
00:46:51,699 --> 00:46:55,389
touching so only ancillary in everything

1134
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:58,269
I've been able to get at least a half a

1135
00:46:55,389 --> 00:46:59,858
dozen ancillary providers in there but

1136
00:46:58,269 --> 00:47:01,210
you also have to you can't just go in

1137
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:03,460
and say I hear you do this you got to

1138
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:05,769
find so many banks there to make

1139
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:08,710
introductions relationships are key but

1140
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:10,150
it's also a Colorado bank so not quite

1141
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,639
as relevant here we're a Colorado

1142
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:15,630
company yeah we're ancillary to so it's

1143
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,629
it's a different

1144
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:30,910
silent partners investors what what's

1145
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:32,469
your analysis on taking on people for

1146
00:47:30,909 --> 00:47:33,969
operating agreements and licensing

1147
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:35,949
agreements so it's not it's not like

1148
00:47:33,969 --> 00:47:37,838
white labeling but you know you're

1149
00:47:35,949 --> 00:47:40,588
having a management firm or real estate

1150
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:47,380
firm and then the second thing would be

1151
00:47:40,588 --> 00:47:49,869
how exactly does it benefit a company by

1152
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,670
dividing your different operating

1153
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:53,170
agreements since a different cup your

1154
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:55,778
different operating arms is different

1155
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,460
companies how does that how do you how

1156
00:47:55,778 --> 00:48:01,389
do you gain advantage through the tax

1157
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:02,920
system exactly everybody's looking at me

1158
00:48:01,389 --> 00:48:04,929
but I don't I don't have an answer to

1159
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:08,680
any of that I have that's what I have

1160
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:09,278
lawyers for are you asking specifics of

1161
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:12,038
280e

1162
00:48:09,278 --> 00:48:14,199
issues right now yeah and then also

1163
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:16,089
there's there's there's that and then

1164
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:17,679
there's also there's the tax piece but

1165
00:48:16,088 --> 00:48:20,679
then there's also the question about the

1166
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:22,808
licensing and the creating operating

1167
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:24,250
agreements I think this is called the

1168
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:25,660
time when when you really want to go

1169
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:29,230
call a lawyer and ask them these kinds

1170
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:32,199
of questions yeah that's right first

1171
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:33,730
ones free one thing though to keep it

1172
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:36,639
cognizant about the white label in the

1173
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:39,809
licensing in the regs 5032 and the

1174
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:44,739
proposed regs that now are now post

1175
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:48,519
commented updated oal regs in the gray

1176
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:51,729
zone there is regulation that doesn't

1177
00:48:48,518 --> 00:48:54,338
allow non licensed entities to work with

1178
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:57,130
licensed entities to do white labeling

1179
00:48:54,338 --> 00:48:59,259
so if that's kind of the the route that

1180
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:02,140
you want to go it may or may not exist

1181
00:48:59,259 --> 00:49:04,929
in 30 days yeah just wait don't hurt

1182
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:07,150
your brain regard so I was just

1183
00:49:04,929 --> 00:49:10,328
questioningly talking to Jeff Jones in

1184
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:12,880
class about the Delaware account so I'm

1185
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:15,400
actually interested in probably

1186
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,990
cooperating but why didn't you or how

1187
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,269
did he go with the Delaware account with

1188
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:21,189
you as far as it being an LLC C and like

1189
00:49:19,268 --> 00:49:24,088
how can I protect myself best in that

1190
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:24,088
process

1191
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:31,108
yeah so the the software side of the

1192
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:35,240
business which is my side in our

1193
00:49:31,108 --> 00:49:37,920
household is Delaware's C Corp

1194
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:40,459
traditional pretty much you know how you

1195
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:44,039
would see it and most my wife is a

1196
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:47,010
California C Corp you know one thing

1197
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:48,989
that you you want to do I mean I guess

1198
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:51,690
it's like how you divvy up your equity

1199
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:53,819
right like if you're granting it all to

1200
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:57,240
yourself you should fill out an IAT 3 B

1201
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:59,338
or 83 B that allows you to if you do

1202
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:04,019
sell and not to pay that much taxes on

1203
00:49:59,338 --> 00:50:05,250
it and I guess like it really depends on

1204
00:50:04,019 --> 00:50:06,900
your business and like how your business

1205
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:09,088
partners are and how you're structuring

1206
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,588
it but if you're trying to go for

1207
00:50:09,088 --> 00:50:12,509
investment and you're trying to get

1208
00:50:10,588 --> 00:50:15,269
founders and you're trying to get equity

1209
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:18,119
and ability of to do advisory shares um

1210
00:50:15,269 --> 00:50:21,960
the C Corp I don't know many other

1211
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:27,210
groups are doing it but see yeah I mean

1212
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:30,720
also yeah from from a liability

1213
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:32,670
perspective LLC versus C Corp is in

1214
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:34,319
theory gonna you know provide for I do

1215
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:37,338
the the shelter from personal liability

1216
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:39,480
just on a you know just an operating

1217
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:40,829
standpoint like if you know you got sued

1218
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,230
for running your business but if we're

1219
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:45,329
talking on a cannabis level it's a

1220
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:47,670
little bit different because you know

1221
00:50:45,329 --> 00:50:49,170
cannabis is not legal in Delaware so you

1222
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,389
know you can't form like a Delaware

1223
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:53,250
corporation to apply for your for

1224
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:55,529
example cultivation permit in California

1225
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,880
so in that instance you need to be

1226
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:58,589
looking at alternative structures and

1227
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,660
generally what you know we have our

1228
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:03,480
clients dues they're either gonna see we

1229
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:05,129
do have some where they will have the

1230
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,900
form a Delaware company that's a holding

1231
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:09,150
company for another company that is

1232
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,309
formed in California to apply for the

1233
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,930
license and so for example you'll take

1234
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:14,849
your investments through the holding

1235
00:51:12,929 --> 00:51:16,618
company level but you're actually

1236
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:20,760
operate your cannabis business in this

1237
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:22,769
subsidiary feel free to reach out and we

1238
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:25,760
can provide you a little further

1239
00:51:22,769 --> 00:51:28,849
resources that you can read up on this

1240
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:32,700
so my question is regarding fundraising

1241
00:51:28,849 --> 00:51:34,338
did you ever tap into other communities

1242
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:36,948
that you belong in

1243
00:51:34,338 --> 00:51:39,048
it's being a cannabis entrepreneur so

1244
00:51:36,949 --> 00:51:40,759
you know for me I'm a queer woman of

1245
00:51:39,048 --> 00:51:43,038
color and so I'm trying to tap into

1246
00:51:40,759 --> 00:51:44,688
networks where they're trying to support

1247
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:46,939
you know entrepreneurs in that kind of

1248
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:51,679
community and if you did you know what

1249
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:53,989
were some of those I definitely you know

1250
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,608
when I first did art you actually I

1251
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:58,188
honestly hadn't had much experience

1252
00:51:55,608 --> 00:52:03,528
pitching and thankfully my pitch is much

1253
00:51:58,188 --> 00:52:05,298
better now but I when I first moved here

1254
00:52:03,528 --> 00:52:06,588
to San Francisco I tried to find all the

1255
00:52:05,298 --> 00:52:08,298
interesting pitch events and one of the

1256
00:52:06,588 --> 00:52:11,599
best ones I went to was a female

1257
00:52:08,298 --> 00:52:15,048
founders pitching female funders and it

1258
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,969
was it was super valuable thankfully I

1259
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:20,208
mean helps to win so I have lots of nice

1260
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:22,429
things to say but honestly those were

1261
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:25,038
funds that were very conventional VC

1262
00:52:22,429 --> 00:52:27,169
funds not canvas focused and our tech is

1263
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:28,819
gonna scale outside a cannabis but today

1264
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:30,739
we make all our revenue in cannabis so

1265
00:52:28,818 --> 00:52:33,139
that definitely is limiting but it was

1266
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:34,818
great because I got relationships out of

1267
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:37,098
that with urban innovation fund and

1268
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:39,318
Bessemer and they both check in on me

1269
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:41,568
quite regularly and so they might not be

1270
00:52:39,318 --> 00:52:44,509
our investor today but I've got I knew I

1271
00:52:41,568 --> 00:52:45,920
was gonna run up against an issue with

1272
00:52:44,509 --> 00:52:49,188
the rest of our financing based on

1273
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,959
something our leader had put in there

1274
00:52:49,188 --> 00:52:53,469
that I couldn't really fight him on and

1275
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:56,509
so I was able to call them and say hey

1276
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:58,338
how do you suggest I frame this when I

1277
00:52:56,509 --> 00:53:01,130
go to do the next part in and they both

1278
00:52:58,338 --> 00:53:02,869
answered me and maybe we'll use them

1279
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:04,519
down line but I really the female events

1280
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:06,829
are good if nothing more for mentorship

1281
00:53:04,518 --> 00:53:10,728
and the introductions that come through

1282
00:53:06,829 --> 00:53:13,699
that yeah I would also say that I'm

1283
00:53:10,728 --> 00:53:15,889
looking at like you know college you

1284
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:18,048
know alma mater is all alumni networks

1285
00:53:15,889 --> 00:53:20,778
these sorts of things especially because

1286
00:53:18,048 --> 00:53:22,099
cannabis is exciting you know for a lot

1287
00:53:20,778 --> 00:53:25,009
of people I think there's a lot of

1288
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:26,869
circles that you can kind of tap into

1289
00:53:25,009 --> 00:53:28,608
and there's a certain novelty factor

1290
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:29,749
about this that people be like oh yeah

1291
00:53:28,608 --> 00:53:31,929
let's let's check that out

1292
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:34,548
and then I know through through our few

1293
00:53:31,929 --> 00:53:38,798
about a year ago now we started the

1294
00:53:34,548 --> 00:53:38,798
women's investor network within our

1295
00:53:39,909 --> 00:53:44,509
command mentorship and camaraderie

1296
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:47,930
within the group

1297
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:50,420
where we have a lot of women investors

1298
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:54,109
who are specifically interested in

1299
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:55,610
backing women founders so that's

1300
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:56,210
something that's been been happening a

1301
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,760
lot as well

1302
00:53:56,210 --> 00:54:01,840
someone encouraged that the common

1303
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:04,310
wisdom is that when times become hard

1304
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:08,180
people tend to gravitate a little more

1305
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:11,469
towards their vices a lot of people

1306
00:54:08,179 --> 00:54:11,469
think that a recession is on the way

1307
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:18,890
curious to hear your opinion on whether

1308
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:20,449
you think that a current entrepreneur in

1309
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:24,079
the space looking to raise say a series

1310
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:27,529
a should maybe try to accelerate their

1311
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:30,409
fundraising process in anticipation of

1312
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:32,360
an coming recession or if you kind of

1313
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:34,609
think that even with the oncoming

1314
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,910
recession there won't be a tightening of

1315
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:40,370
the capital markets in this space yeah

1316
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:43,819
money money is very finicky right get it

1317
00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:45,500
one you can't is a good good motto right

1318
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:47,510
I mean not too much don't raise too much

1319
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:51,139
but but usually what I find is is is

1320
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:53,810
invest is companies raise too late and

1321
00:54:51,139 --> 00:54:55,219
not enough right it's usually not the

1322
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:56,989
other way around

1323
00:54:55,219 --> 00:55:00,919
so I would say that the other thing I

1324
00:54:56,989 --> 00:55:03,709
would say is that when the economy goes

1325
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,269
down it's not good for us because it

1326
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:07,909
means people have less money they're a

1327
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:10,789
little more protective but it's also in

1328
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:14,089
a lot of ways we're a little bit

1329
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:16,550
recession proof too because if if other

1330
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:19,039
things are going down this becomes one

1331
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:20,900
of the few places where you see the CAG

1332
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:23,300
or the compound annual growth rates

1333
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,950
still being really strong I don't think

1334
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:27,289
it has too much to do with people

1335
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:29,629
clinging to their vices I mean this that

1336
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:31,670
that particular thing I think is maybe

1337
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:34,010
after everything's legal everywhere and

1338
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:35,750
you've got a something going on like

1339
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:39,290
that that it would have that but the the

1340
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:44,449
the factor of new states legalizing is a

1341
00:55:39,289 --> 00:55:46,759
far more of a push from from that from

1342
00:55:44,449 --> 00:55:50,659
that side of things so that would be on

1343
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:52,940
saying yeah I just wanted to answer

1344
00:55:50,659 --> 00:55:55,879
Nancy's question who I have it

1345
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:58,070
investors are everywhere they have

1346
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:01,460
different meetings and groups to

1347
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:03,530
there's a lot conferences I chose to go

1348
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:05,150
in my startup community so a launch

1349
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:08,230
festival is something that you know

1350
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:11,000
we've been a part of that we've gone to

1351
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:13,250
runway was another group in the cannabis

1352
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,650
space that had something you know

1353
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,960
lesbians who tech there's a whole nother

1354
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:19,880
group in there usually investors are

1355
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,619
going to those spaces and trying to

1356
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,789
figure out who to invest in so jump

1357
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:24,980
around you can meet new people

1358
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:27,259
everywhere and this space is interesting

1359
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:29,960
enough that a lot of people may may

1360
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:34,400
consider it as far as the recession

1361
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:37,130
question I think it's a founder this

1362
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:40,160
feels very like dot-com II but also like

1363
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:42,920
you know 2008-2009 when he had a little

1364
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:45,409
bit it's not like that dire so I don't

1365
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,440
see that happening but I do think when

1366
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:50,269
you feel recession coming in then as a

1367
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,130
founder you have three ways to really

1368
00:56:50,269 --> 00:56:55,460
sort of bulletproof it one sure you can

1369
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:58,099
go raise money but more importantly like

1370
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:00,108
cut your costs figure out where yours

1371
00:56:58,099 --> 00:57:02,269
not don't need to be spending money and

1372
00:57:00,108 --> 00:57:05,449
then figure out how to make some money

1373
00:57:02,269 --> 00:57:07,759
right sometimes the best cure of four

1374
00:57:05,449 --> 00:57:11,179
founders not to go pitch twenty people

1375
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,310
is to go sell or pitch twenty potential

1376
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:16,059
partners that way it gives you traction

1377
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:19,460
it gives you you know money the bank

1378
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:21,019
gives you product feedback to see if

1379
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:24,050
you're resonating and if your pitch is

1380
00:57:21,019 --> 00:57:26,900
resonating you don't want to be in a

1381
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:29,380
situation where you need to raise

1382
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:31,700
because like investors you can smell it

1383
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:34,789
they just smell it and they know you

1384
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:36,319
need it and if you do that you lose a

1385
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:40,639
little bit of leverage and you're

1386
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:44,420
negotiating but if you're like I don't

1387
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:46,789
need you I got my business we're running

1388
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:49,670
you know we're strong team we've cut our

1389
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:51,108
costs and we'll be profitable later you

1390
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:53,869
know I think the the biggest thing that

1391
00:57:51,108 --> 00:57:55,219
we've learned is it's not about the

1392
00:57:53,869 --> 00:57:56,358
first one out of the gate it's one of

1393
00:57:55,219 --> 00:57:59,089
the last you won't be one of the last

1394
00:57:56,358 --> 00:58:01,670
ones standing and by making sure you

1395
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:04,280
constantly have a runway right whether

1396
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:06,079
it's three months six months ideally 12

1397
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,600
to 24 I think that gives you enough

1398
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:11,929
longevity in this thing to ride out the

1399
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:15,000
three six-month interim waves

1400
00:58:11,929 --> 00:58:18,329
then you you're gonna be there but if

1401
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,889
you ramp up costs if you ramp up hiring

1402
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:21,900
and you know you're not going to be able

1403
00:58:19,889 --> 00:58:25,259
to hit your growth targets then you're

1404
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:28,440
gonna be in a situation that just is a

1405
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:29,770
downward spiral I think that was a very

1406
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:43,068
good note to end on

1407
00:58:29,769 --> 00:58:43,068
