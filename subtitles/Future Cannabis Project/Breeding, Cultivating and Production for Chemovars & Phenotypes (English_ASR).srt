2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,298
years ago the situation with cannabis

3
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,100
was there was a lot of low potency

4
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:20,309
material around but don't let anyone

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,100
tell you that there wasn't good potent

6
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:27,710
material there was it was just a little

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:31,349
bit rarer harder to find more expensive

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:34,439
also at that time there were a lot of

9
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,829
what we called land races so these were

10
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:40,459
cannabis types that had been grown in a

11
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,549
particular area for many generations

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:46,739
they were ecologically adapted to the

13
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:49,919
local environment they could deal with

14
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:55,039
the past they were vigorous but beyond

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,559
that they had very interesting psychic

16
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,390
psychological characteristics a

17
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:03,599
psychopharmacological

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:06,450
effects that we just don't see today one

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,420
of the big problems in cannabis breeding

20
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,810
from my standpoint is something we heard

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,659
about earlier that we've had this

22
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,070
homogeneous Asian part of this is a

23
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,040
byproduct of prohibition and basically

24
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:25,978
in a situation where a drug is illegal

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,590
it makes sense to have it as potent as

26
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:32,539
possible so it's the lowest volume of

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:38,100
possible which helps prevent discovery

28
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:41,009
by law enforcement in particular so what

29
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:44,099
we've had is selective breeding for the

30
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,590
last 40 years for high THC to the

31
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,390
exclusion of everything else what we've

32
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,149
ended up with in the market is a

33
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,710
situation in which we've got almost

34
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:58,649
everything is high THC and high merci

35
00:01:54,709 --> 00:02:02,280
that combination is notorious for

36
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,189
producing couch lock now I know that

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,560
people some people like this effect but

38
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:10,560
most consumers of cannabis aren't really

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,620
looking to be immobilized they're

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,469
looking to

41
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,709
either a good experience or a

42
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:20,109
therapeutic experience and if you have

43
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:22,180
pain and have to sleep that's a good

44
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:26,920
combination but if you have to work or

45
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:29,920
study it's not basically cannabis has a

46
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:31,809
great deal more to offer and part of

47
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:39,759
what we'd like to discuss this evening

48
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:41,530
is that and why targets and goals I'd

49
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,159
like to share with you because I think

50
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:48,939
that this represents an avenue going

51
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:51,129
forward where what I like to call

52
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:54,519
barefoot breeders I hope nobody thinks

53
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:56,318
that that's derogatory in any way but

54
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,090
these would be the people like many of

55
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:01,238
you that have been dedicated to the

56
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,939
plant maybe living off the grid for a

57
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,579
long period of time I've never had the

58
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:08,709
rewards from your effort maybe on a

59
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:10,900
personal level but certainly not on a

60
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:14,650
commercial level where you could make

61
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,109
this a living a viable living doing this

62
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,109
and this is I think a worthy goal it's

63
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:22,659
not about making millions of dollars

64
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:25,840
it's about being able to do what you

65
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:28,150
love on at the same time helping a lot

66
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,729
of people out there and I don't mean to

67
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,159
exclude what some people call

68
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:37,149
recreational use of cannabis because if

69
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:40,269
the question is can we make recreational

70
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,250
cannabis a lot better you bet and I

71
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:44,650
think we could help with describing

72
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,299
those characteristics but I'm going to

73
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:53,500
primarily talk about medical

74
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:56,500
applications so beyond the high THC high

75
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,299
Mersin this is spilt over now there in

76
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,939
the last several years there's been

77
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:04,120
great interest in cannabidiol for all

78
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:07,090
its medical attributes but we've ended

79
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,609
up with an analogous situation and that

80
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,120
now we have a bunch of CBD kiemce of

81
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:12,400
ours

82
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,549
they're also rich in Mersin which has

83
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,949
created the misconception that

84
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:20,918
cannabidiol is sedating it's not when

85
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:23,439
you've got CBD without mersin it's

86
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,538
actually innovating and a lot of people

87
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,089
or you

88
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:29,788
CBD preparations instead of caffeine in

89
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:33,478
the morning but what we'd like to have

90
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:36,568
people aim for is CBD predominant chemo

91
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:41,060
VARs with little or no THC that could

92
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:44,098
qualify as hemp although I have

93
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,288
difficulties as a scientist and the

94
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:51,329
current definition in this country of

95
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:53,818
just 0.3 or less percent THC so we're

96
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:57,959
also interested in CBD key movers with

97
00:04:53,819 --> 00:05:00,930
little or no Mersin rather to emphasize

98
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,149
some of the other terpenoids the

99
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:07,590
aromatic components that modulate the

100
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:10,429
effects of cannabis specifically CBD

101
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:14,668
with high limonene limonene is a great

102
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:17,158
antidepressant you combine that with the

103
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:20,870
anti-anxiety effects of CBD and you've

104
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:23,668
got a great agent for a variety of

105
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:28,079
psychiatric conditions or just

106
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:28,819
garden-variety bad day anxious that kind

107
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,359
of thing

108
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:35,490
similarly cannabidiol with hi Linda Lou

109
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:39,150
Lin Aloha like CBD is an anti-anxiety

110
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:41,658
agent famous for coming from lavender

111
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:46,288
but but you on that both of them are

112
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:47,759
anticonvulsant and from colleagues who

113
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:50,550
have used these types of combinations

114
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,098
and patients with severe epilepsy

115
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:58,050
they're seeing success where there

116
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:59,939
wasn't any before with just CBD so these

117
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,449
are the kinds of potentials that we can

118
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:06,149
see another really interesting target is

119
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:08,490
CBD with hi Carrie awfully Carrie

120
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:12,870
awfully tends to be the predominant

121
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:15,810
turpenoid in a lot of extracts so it'll

122
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,120
be preserved say in a co2 extract

123
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,879
whereas you'd lose some of the lower

124
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,500
molecular weight monitor annoyed the

125
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:27,629
limonene the myrrh seen on the pining

126
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,240
but CBD with high Carrie awfully knows

127
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:33,680
ents a very broad spectrum of medical

128
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,478
activity both are anti-inflammatory

129
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,788
together they can be analgesic being

130
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,889
relieving

131
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:42,199
ah both have anti addictive properties

132
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:45,769
and could help people get off of opioids

133
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,740
in any other addictive drug and then

134
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:51,680
they would have application in

135
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:55,788
autoimmune conditions so it's really

136
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,439
limited only by the imagination another

137
00:06:55,788 --> 00:07:00,408
thing we'd like to see inbreeding is

138
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:03,249
more type 2 preparations so a balance of

139
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:03,248
THC and CBD

140
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:07,430
additionally selective breeding where

141
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:10,699
you're going to have that kind of

142
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:14,889
combination but with high selective

143
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:17,559
terpenoids as well especially pining

144
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:20,389
pining is an acetylcholinesterase

145
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:23,330
inhibitor acetylcholine is the memory

146
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:26,509
molecule on the brain and when you have

147
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:29,359
more of it you don't have the Oh what

148
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:33,309
was I saying the short-term memory

149
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,949
impairment for which THC is infamous

150
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:39,860
that's funny in a social setting but

151
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:42,288
again if your chronic pain patient and

152
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:46,729
you have to work you don't want to be

153
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:50,088
forgetting so four alertness and clarity

154
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:56,028
of a high pining is what you want to

155
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:58,788
look for then a big one how many of you

156
00:07:56,028 --> 00:08:03,139
are familiar on an experiential basis

157
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:08,269
with cannabis Jarrell CBG so I see a few

158
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:12,079
hands go up canapa girolle is the parent

159
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:14,748
of the other cannabinoids in the plant

160
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:18,318
of course it's in the acid form so can a

161
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:21,889
bird can can of bigger Olek acid easy

162
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:25,789
for me to say we know almost nothing

163
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:30,168
about what CB GA does but we do know

164
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:32,679
quite a bit about CB g in my way of

165
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:35,958
thinking this is the next big thing in

166
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:39,708
cannabis and heretofore it's really been

167
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:42,439
pretty much ignored but this is a very

168
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:46,068
unusual molecule

169
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,860
first of all odd has very pronounced

170
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:50,539
antibiotic activity including against

171
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,389
some really bad

172
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:58,059
like methicillin-resistant Staph aureus

173
00:08:53,389 --> 00:09:00,620
that has caused some Hospital epidemics

174
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:02,659
and this is why they scrub you before

175
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:08,149
surgery so that you don't get horrible

176
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:11,480
wound infections beyond that it has a

177
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:14,269
very interesting profile in that it's a

178
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,620
very powerful anti-anxiety agent without

179
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:20,480
being sedating anybody who's taken

180
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:24,500
medicines like the benzodiazepines

181
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:28,240
valium at all almost all the drugs that

182
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:32,720
have been used pharmaceutically to treat

183
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,750
anxiety have been sedating and often

184
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,690
addictive on this presents a profile

185
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,330
that's really benign in comparison to

186
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,520
those drugs

187
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:46,310
additionally CBG is very active against

188
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:51,110
a number of types of cancer particularly

189
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:53,629
prostate cancer which is number one or

190
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:58,450
number two most common type of cancer in

191
00:09:53,629 --> 00:10:01,340
men so a great potential there

192
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:04,070
additionally it seems like we have

193
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,259
evidence of a variety of chemo VARs that

194
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,140
are very rich in CBG that will have

195
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:12,319
little or no THC and could qualify as

196
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:15,039
hemp and eventually if we get the laws

197
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,390
right could go across state and

198
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,309
international borders and I'm hoping

199
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:22,909
that Dale will talk more about

200
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:25,699
strategies there we think with the right

201
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:28,339
legislation or even without it there may

202
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,310
be some work around so that your work in

203
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:34,610
one state could reach other

204
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:36,439
jurisdictions I'm also interested in

205
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,470
something that almost nobody is is

206
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,140
working on and that would be zero

207
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:46,639
cannabinoid plants now why would you

208
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:49,309
want that well there are two reasons one

209
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:52,039
is very interesting for research work

210
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:55,489
where you want to compare the entourage

211
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:57,679
of the terpenoids against a similar

212
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,379
entourage of terpenoids with

213
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:04,009
cannabinoids but that's a little bit

214
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:06,500
nerdy another reason is that

215
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:09,730
you can make essential oil of cannabis

216
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:13,370
without the liability we'll call it of

217
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:16,670
THC content and some people are going to

218
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:21,950
want to use this as a flavoring or as a

219
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:23,360
perfume or a Roma therapy agent and they

220
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,960
may want to use this to make

221
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,820
preparations to help if you have a keema

222
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,340
var that has one profile that you like

223
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,300
but you want to add more line meaning to

224
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:37,790
it you can selectively breed for that

225
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:40,159
you know ideally we would prefer to have

226
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:42,679
chemo VARs that have the exact profile

227
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,379
we want but that's that's hard that

228
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:47,839
takes multiple generations and there are

229
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:51,590
some shortcuts where you're still

230
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:54,830
working just with cannabis and it may be

231
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:57,740
that pharmaceutical agents are made this

232
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:00,379
way sativex which is approved in 30

233
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:03,769
countries is actually a combination of

234
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:11,230
two chemo VARs one high in THC one high

235
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:14,870
in CBD next THC V tetrahydrocannabinol

236
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:18,470
is THC with the three carbon sidechain

237
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:21,110
instead of five this is a really

238
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:24,200
interesting agent as well it's found in

239
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:29,990
low amounts in cannabis from southern

240
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:31,790
Africa it is different to THC however in

241
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:35,659
that it's what's called a neutral

242
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:38,750
antagonist at low doses it opposes the

243
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:42,079
activity at the cb1 receptor so it

244
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:45,679
actually allows hunger it's very good

245
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:50,509
for diabetes metabolic syndrome but

246
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:53,709
beyond that it is anticonvulsant and it

247
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:55,669
is good for neuropathic pain

248
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,280
experientially when there's a good

249
00:12:55,669 --> 00:13:02,179
amount of it with THC it makes for a

250
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:06,919
clearer high rapid onset a more rapid

251
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:10,370
offset as well so we think that this has

252
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:12,439
great potential and then you can get

253
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,990
into things where you're really seeing a

254
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,660
combination of ingredients that can be

255
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,700
therapeutic so

256
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:23,750
Keem there are key movers that combined

257
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:27,500
CBD CBD V Lynaugh Lowell and carry off

258
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:29,990
allene maybe with a touch of THC all of

259
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,600
those can have beneficial effects on

260
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,879
epilepsy so together there's every

261
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,389
reason to expect they'll be synergistic

262
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:42,049
and provide much better medicine than

263
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:45,679
say CBD alone which now is an FDA

264
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:49,509
approved drug in this country just a few

265
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:53,089
words about others I haven't mentioned

266
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:54,980
cannabic Romijn so CPC is considered one

267
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:58,970
of the major cannabinoids but we

268
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:02,120
actually see very little of it in most

269
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:05,680
types of cannabis the reason for that is

270
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:10,909
unlike THC and CBD which are products of

271
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:14,419
dominant genes CBC can a macro mean is

272
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:17,469
produced by a recessive gene so it's not

273
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:20,120
going to tend to be expressed

274
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:24,970
additionally it's going to appear in

275
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:28,159
higher concentrations in immature plants

276
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:31,100
it's actually possible if you've got a

277
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:35,629
plant that has a good amount of cannabic

278
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:38,720
Romijn you could make hash out of it at

279
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:43,549
a younger age to produce what my former

280
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:47,810
colleague David Potter called ETP an

281
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:52,279
enriched trichome product otherwise

282
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:54,439
known as Keef but this is again a very

283
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:57,069
versatile age and it's shown some

284
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,320
antidepressant effects in the animals

285
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:03,350
again has anti-inflammatory activity

286
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:08,300
it's good for a wide range of cancer

287
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:11,269
cell types and we really haven't had it

288
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:15,709
available in insufficient amounts to do

289
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:19,939
the kind of work that would make it good

290
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:24,259
commercial target then the acid

291
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:26,330
cannabinoids many of you live in this

292
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:30,669
area may be familiar with juicing

293
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,670
cannabis but that's like

294
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:36,899
headed for the right target but using

295
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:39,240
the wrong technique juicing is generally

296
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:41,730
done with fan leaves massive amounts

297
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,909
often people are juicing 30 big fan

298
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:47,759
leaves a day and it's just an impossible

299
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:52,679
thing for most people to sustain unless

300
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:55,350
they've got acres of material rather if

301
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,509
we're going for the cannabinoids their

302
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,960
concentration of course is greatest in

303
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:04,549
the the flowers on that should be the

304
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:08,490
source of it why are we interested in

305
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:10,500
THC a tetrahydrocannabinol ik acid which

306
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:14,070
has been billed as being non

307
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,679
psychoactive and has been actually in

308
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:20,010
the past called inactive which is

309
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:22,469
absolutely wrong well as many of you may

310
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:25,649
be aware this also has therapeutic

311
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:30,149
activity is quite distinct from THC

312
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:32,459
itself about in the prior decade it was

313
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:34,519
established that this works on something

314
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,259
called tumour necrosis factor alpha

315
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:40,879
which is very important in certain

316
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:43,470
autoimmune conditions including the

317
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,039
inflammatory bowel conditions Crohn's

318
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:50,370
and ulcerative colitis but also an MS

319
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:54,449
rheumatoid arthritis so we've seen a lot

320
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:57,529
of people that will juice or get THC a

321
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,520
from flowers that have had very positive

322
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:02,129
influences on their autoimmune

323
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,139
conditions and then two years ago in

324
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:07,769
Spain it was noted that there was

325
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,449
another important activity various of

326
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:12,869
the cannabinoids work on something

327
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:16,650
called P / gamma this is a nuclear

328
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:21,568
receptor it affects gene transcription

329
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:24,390
which sounds really scary but you can

330
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:27,809
have good effects or bad effects the

331
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:30,450
good effects of P power gamma are that

332
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:33,659
it can contribute to weight loss and

333
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:36,509
people who are obese it can positively

334
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,779
affect cancer on a variety of other

335
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:42,690
disease conditions and as it turns out

336
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:43,490
THC a is much more potent on the people

337
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,529
are gamma

338
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:49,220
laughter than any of the other

339
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:51,829
cannabinoids so part of the problem with

340
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,769
THC a is it's unstable it breaks down

341
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:57,769
into the stuff called THC it gets people

342
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:59,779
intoxicated which again can be a good or

343
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:04,910
bad thing but there may be ways to

344
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:06,799
stabilize THC a and certainly when

345
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:09,440
people are making fresh material it's

346
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,819
freely available and again makes a good

347
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:18,259
target it's a now analogous product is

348
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:20,419
CBD a cannabidiol like acid again we

349
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:23,000
know a little bit less here but we do

350
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:26,390
know is tantalizing some of you may be

351
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,970
aware that cannabidiol also works on

352
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:32,570
serotonin receptors this is the basis

353
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:35,390
for it's anti-anxiety a fact as well as

354
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:37,369
a number of neuro protective benefits in

355
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:41,210
the brain and possibly its

356
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:43,519
anticonvulsant effect but cannabidiol ik

357
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:47,410
acid does a hundred times more potent on

358
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:51,609
the 5ht serotonin when a receptor

359
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:55,850
additionally based on the accounts from

360
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:59,449
the renaissance herbalists they used raw

361
00:18:55,849 --> 00:19:02,089
hemp which would have been relatively

362
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:04,640
rich in CBD a and treating a variety of

363
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:07,730
tumors so we really haven't looked at

364
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,179
that yet but this soul is a product that

365
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:14,019
deserves a lot more attention on I

366
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:19,519
wanted to finish this section with

367
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:23,720
cannabinol CBN now I'm sort of amused by

368
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:25,190
this CBN is an oxidative breakdown

369
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,130
product at THC

370
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:31,279
if you have cannabis that's been sitting

371
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:35,929
out for a couple of years its THC is

372
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:38,240
going to turn into CBN we've got a lot

373
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:41,509
of companies touting this as having some

374
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:45,130
real advantages I think that a lot of

375
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:48,679
this is wishful thinking it is true that

376
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:50,600
there's a misconception that CBN is very

377
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:54,559
sedating and they're there for a good

378
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:56,829
for sleep rather it's a case of CBN is

379
00:19:54,558 --> 00:20:01,028
and it's basically

380
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:03,490
25% of the potency of THC the reason

381
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:06,069
that old cannabis makes you sleep isn't

382
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:10,750
because of CBN it's because you've lost

383
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:16,470
the more alerting monitor Pinoys in

384
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:20,169
favor of sedating sesqui terpenoids and

385
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:23,048
beyond that I think that this quest for

386
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:26,250
CBN is a way of trying to use up old

387
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:29,619
dope that wasn't good for anything else

388
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:31,929
now some people may disagree with me but

389
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:35,739
I guarantee that most of the people that

390
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:40,570
are heavily marketing CBN have this in

391
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:43,179
mind just a very little bit about the

392
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:46,058
terpenoids beyond what we've said

393
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:52,080
already have mentioned limonene pining

394
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:55,928
and Mersin and Lyn Ahlul Turpin allene

395
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:58,509
terpene lean is an interesting terpenoid

396
00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:01,269
we seem more in California than other

397
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:03,849
places it's beginning to get popular and

398
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:08,169
in Washington where I live

399
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:10,839
odd one in that got discrepancies and

400
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:13,960
how it affects different species its

401
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:18,339
sedating in animals but when people use

402
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:21,308
it it has more of a buzz and again like

403
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:24,788
pining it may have some effect to boost

404
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:29,859
acetylcholine levels on a lot of people

405
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:32,879
like it if they have to do use cannabis

406
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:37,689
and do work like cleaning the garage

407
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:40,960
might increase their focus and I

408
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:45,429
mentioned Kerry awfully Nazz well again

409
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:48,399
very impressive agent this is working it

410
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:51,190
has the distinction of not just being a

411
00:21:48,398 --> 00:21:55,048
terpenoid but a cannabinoid as well it

412
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:58,360
is directly affecting the cb2 receptor

413
00:21:55,048 --> 00:22:02,138
so this is the non psychoactive receptor

414
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:05,259
which nonetheless has important pain

415
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:10,449
reducing and anti-inflammatory activity

416
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:12,759
as well as being anti addictive so

417
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:15,490
having carry off lien in a good amount

418
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:18,029
in a cannabis based preparation is going

419
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:21,910
to cover a lot of bases therapeutically

420
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:26,319
and quickly mention in carol carry off

421
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:29,470
allene oxide this may be what is

422
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:34,029
responsible for is the scent that

423
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:36,220
sniffer dogs key in on but beyond that

424
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:39,700
it seems to be an extremely strong

425
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:41,920
antifungal even working on nail fungus

426
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:47,319
and there's one of the prescription

427
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:49,929
drugs that's advertised on TV you can

428
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:53,319
spend five thousand dollars over six

429
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:58,390
months and have a 50% chance of curing

430
00:22:53,319 --> 00:23:01,119
your nail fungus but apparently on an 8%

431
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:04,240
solution to this reportedly can cure

432
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:07,239
nail fungus in in two weeks so what's

433
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:12,160
wrong with this picture so there's great

434
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:15,700
potential out there i think that's all i

435
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,370
wanted to say now i want to start by

436
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:21,789
just saying that one of the things i

437
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:26,279
like doing is talking to audiences that

438
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:29,230
are kind of new to cannabis i i spoke at

439
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:31,690
the association of university technology

440
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,490
managers so these are these are the tech

441
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:36,340
transfer offices and universities that

442
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,079
try to get patents on whatever it is

443
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:40,329
their professors have discovered and

444
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,730
then they once they get the patents or

445
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:44,589
lately a patent applications filed then

446
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,779
they find a licensee that wants access

447
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,490
to that and they'll pay a fee and the

448
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:50,710
university can replenish its its

449
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,779
research funding and so on but

450
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,039
universities have completely stayed away

451
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:55,740
from cannabis because they don't want to

452
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:58,960
lose their federal research funding and

453
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,609
you know you touch the plant and you

454
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,019
might lose all your research funding and

455
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:04,389
a lot of universities would just dry up

456
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:06,700
so i had a chance to talk to them about

457
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,920
the cannabis industry and i think about

458
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,470
february and i realized

459
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,450
alright these people might be where I

460
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,980
was a couple years ago where well a few

461
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,080
years ago when I first got into the

462
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:20,410
cannabis industry from just my more

463
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:23,439
conventional law practice I didn't know

464
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,950
what CBD CBD was I went to MJ biz con

465
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,480
one year

466
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,569
talking about CBD I had to look it up

467
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,069
and I realized now you all I mean some

468
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:33,730
of you've been in this for generations

469
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:36,579
as many of you your whole life but I was

470
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:39,278
talking to an audience that had had

471
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:42,579
begun to hear about CBD you know well

472
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:44,079
what I said is a few years ago none of

473
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:45,609
us in this room had heard of it and now

474
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:48,819
your grandma and your dog are both

475
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:53,168
taking it and they knew that's true and

476
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:57,369
then the news flash was cannabis has way

477
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:58,960
more than just THC and CBD and you know

478
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:00,579
depending on which number you believe it

479
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,940
might make a hundred and fifty different

480
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:06,879
cannabinoids plus all the terpenes and

481
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,320
and ethan talked about many of them but

482
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,049
it makes way more than the ones he

483
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:16,089
talked about plus the the flavonoids and

484
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:18,788
what's really interesting is at the

485
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:20,939
receptor level and I learned a lot about

486
00:25:18,788 --> 00:25:23,798
receptors some in grad school but also

487
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,509
some working with a company that that

488
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:28,569
found natural insecticides that were

489
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:30,519
based on the way essential oils

490
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:32,379
completely safe essential oils acted on

491
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:35,319
the receptors the olfactory receptors in

492
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,429
insect system okay now let's stop there

493
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:38,648
for a second why would that happen

494
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:42,009
because plants evolved their essential

495
00:25:38,648 --> 00:25:43,778
oils as defenses and so somebody thought

496
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:45,190
well okay let's look at instead of

497
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:47,950
looking at these one at a time let's try

498
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,389
making pairwise combinations and some of

499
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,720
them were more potent than the most

500
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:54,969
potent chemical pesticides others were

501
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,409
extremely potent repellents and was

502
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,788
completely natural stuff you could spray

503
00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:00,399
it on your kitchen counter and all the

504
00:25:57,788 --> 00:26:01,599
Flies would die but you could wipe piece

505
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:03,250
of bread on it and eat it you wouldn't

506
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:06,908
wouldn't taste very good but you could

507
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:09,548
do that so the point of all this is that

508
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:14,769
as soon as we start to look at the plant

509
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:18,579
as not just THC or CBD or soar it's way

510
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:20,169
more than just how high is the THC how

511
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:22,898
high is the CBD what is the terpene

512
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:25,210
profile it's there are so many different

513
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:27,158
active molecules that could act at

514
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,829
different receptors in combination and

515
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:31,330
create amazing synergies and sometimes I

516
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:33,339
don't think that even shows up in a CoA

517
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:35,319
because some of these some of these

518
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:37,778
molecules will be active at levels that

519
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:39,460
are either just at detection or even

520
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:41,618
low detection but they're at receptor

521
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,538
activity the receptor could be really

522
00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:46,238
powerful especially in combination

523
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:48,700
so the reason I'm going into all this is

524
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:52,509
that I honestly believe that the future

525
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:54,788
of medicine the next century of medicine

526
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:57,729
is going to come from this plant it's

527
00:26:54,788 --> 00:26:59,710
not going to come from you know

528
00:26:57,729 --> 00:27:01,840
manufactured molecules in the

529
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,798
pharmaceutical industry I'll just stop

530
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:05,769
there for a second have you heard of

531
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:08,229
combinatorial chemistry the wave farmer

532
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:10,210
discovers many of its drugs it starts

533
00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:12,278
with some core and then it makes a

534
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,929
million variations on this core molecule

535
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:15,729
and then it has something called

536
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:17,619
high-throughput screening where it tests

537
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:20,200
those on cell cultures to see if

538
00:27:17,618 --> 00:27:23,168
anything happens and it's just

539
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,629
completely random you know random works

540
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:28,629
if you if you have enough of a sample

541
00:27:25,628 --> 00:27:32,138
size and you can afford it but instead

542
00:27:28,628 --> 00:27:34,388
how about if we look at molecules that

543
00:27:32,138 --> 00:27:36,638
we already know operate on human

544
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:40,118
receptors in many cases for an amazing

545
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:42,158
array of benefits so what does this have

546
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:45,519
to do with this what ethan calls

547
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,580
barefoot breeders I've worked with plant

548
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,319
breeders my whole career since I I was a

549
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:50,978
plant scientist before I went to law

550
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,798
school

551
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:55,359
and so I kind of got channeled to that

552
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:57,668
in the first law firm I was in and I

553
00:27:55,358 --> 00:28:00,308
worked with some companies that were

554
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:03,190
developing special fruits and flowers

555
00:28:00,308 --> 00:28:06,388
that had great commercial potential and

556
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:08,369
we helped them launch their their

557
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:12,069
licensing programs all over the world

558
00:28:08,368 --> 00:28:14,829
well when I get into this industry and I

559
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:18,398
and I start seeing what the struggles

560
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:20,408
that plant breeders who are passionate

561
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:24,548
about the plant the struggles they face

562
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:29,528
with taxation regulation licensing just

563
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:31,989
funding and I realized okay I've talked

564
00:28:29,528 --> 00:28:33,788
already about standing up to big AG we

565
00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:35,558
need to be different from big AG big AG

566
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:37,509
is going to have the firepower to do

567
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:40,778
marker-assisted breeding and genetic

568
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:44,378
engineering all of that stuff let them

569
00:28:40,778 --> 00:28:47,979
have it my sense is that we have in this

570
00:28:44,378 --> 00:28:49,538
community in this and yeah is it I would

571
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:51,500
say in the community is a better word

572
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:54,769
than industry especially in this contact

573
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,628
we have people who have decades

574
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:59,240
individuals who have decades of

575
00:28:56,628 --> 00:29:02,269
experience breeding the plant and we

576
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,149
have at least hundreds of them maybe

577
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:07,548
thousands and if you think about how we

578
00:29:05,148 --> 00:29:09,949
can be different from big AG and

579
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:14,240
actually be way damn better than big AG

580
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:17,298
we've got the biggest R&amp;D team in the

581
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,179
history of pharmaceuticals or medicines

582
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:22,190
and and it's all this is this isn't even

583
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:24,500
this is jus if we just took a snapshot

584
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,570
of what people have in their greenhouses

585
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:32,048
in their seed collections we've already

586
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:34,519
got way more person years of R&amp;D on

587
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:37,369
plants that are promising to be way more

588
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:41,298
powerful than combinatorial chemistry or

589
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:43,339
even marker-assisted breeding and so my

590
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:45,829
sense is we don't know all the things

591
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:48,288
that cannabinoids Ethan's been talking

592
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:51,798
about we know what cannabinoids 1 &amp; 2 is

593
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:53,929
THC and THC and CBD he's been talking

594
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:55,190
about maybe cannabinoids 3 through 10

595
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:58,129
and they've got all these amazing

596
00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:02,409
potential potentialities but then let's

597
00:29:58,128 --> 00:30:04,878
talk about cannabinoids 11 through 150

598
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:07,190
we've got to be able to find him we've

599
00:30:04,878 --> 00:30:08,359
got to be able to at least detect him in

600
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,240
high enough levels that we know which

601
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:13,519
plants to breed to elevate those levels

602
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,288
and then elevate the levels enough that

603
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:19,970
we can start to figure out what the hell

604
00:30:15,288 --> 00:30:23,359
they do but is there any doubt that you

605
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:26,120
know if if 1 through 10 have these

606
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,490
incredibly powerful effects any of which

607
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:30,798
can be can be used in the right way to

608
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:33,769
have a beneficial effect do you think

609
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:37,398
that 11 through 150 are gonna have some

610
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:38,628
value absolutely so we don't know what

611
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:43,038
what it'll be yet but it's super

612
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:45,558
exciting so our barefoot breeder program

613
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,878
is that I have what I've found is I've

614
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:49,009
worked with a lot of plant breeders is

615
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:50,658
some of them are really good at Bizness

616
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:53,149
and the ones that are good at Bizness

617
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:56,809
you've heard of them or some of you are

618
00:30:53,148 --> 00:30:58,939
here but it's like okay the gene that

619
00:30:56,808 --> 00:31:00,769
makes you a good plant breeder whatever

620
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,600
that gene and it's not genetic but if it

621
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:03,740
were the gene that makes you a good

622
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,329
plant breeder and the gene that makes

623
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:08,690
you a good business person

624
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:10,668
are not linked right it's it's a happy

625
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,889
coincidence when that happens but it's

626
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:15,288
it's a it's a coincidence there are a

627
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:18,199
lot of people who are passionate about

628
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:21,109
plant breeding and really good at it who

629
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,220
don't even want to be entrepreneurs they

630
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:24,048
don't want to start their own business

631
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,999
they don't want to go find funding they

632
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:29,538
don't want to hire lawyers and on and on

633
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:31,429
and on and after talking with several

634
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:33,169
breeders that were like that was they

635
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:36,619
exactly fit that profile they had

636
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:40,369
amazing work they've done amazing work

637
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:42,949
they had amazing cultivars but zero

638
00:31:40,368 --> 00:31:45,769
interest and maybe zero opportunity to

639
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:48,319
become great entrepreneurs and and take

640
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:50,349
the the cultivars they had developed and

641
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:53,450
really get them out there to the world

642
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:55,908
after several these kinds of

643
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,889
conversations I realized that somebody

644
00:31:55,909 --> 00:32:00,379
ought to have something like a record

645
00:31:57,888 --> 00:32:02,118
company where the breeders are the

646
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:03,558
songwriters and the singers and they

647
00:32:02,118 --> 00:32:06,199
don't have to be good at anything else

648
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:07,788
all they have to do is do what they're

649
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,710
passionate about and be good at it and

650
00:32:07,788 --> 00:32:12,470
then somebody else steps in and says

651
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:14,840
okay we got you we'll take it from here

652
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:16,700
and by the way like a good record

653
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:19,069
company instead of a bad one we will

654
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,679
take care of you you'll be proud to work

655
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:23,589
with us you'll get paid fairly and we'll

656
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:30,048
get your work out to the whole world and

657
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:31,519
so you can even have groupies in fact we

658
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:35,269
all wish we had the groupies and Ethan

659
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:39,259
has right but we were talking about that

660
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:44,058
a while ago just watch so anyway that

661
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:46,489
the the beauty of this is that they can

662
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:49,368
be good at what they're good at and then

663
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:51,169
they can let somebody else take care of

664
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:52,788
the rest so I talked to a few people

665
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:55,600
about this in the industry and they were

666
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:59,499
pretty receptive very receptive to it

667
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:02,748
and then I went to a friend of mine who

668
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:04,159
has been a really good CEO for some

669
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:06,649
startup companies that I've worked with

670
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,710
and I said hey would you be the CEO of

671
00:33:06,648 --> 00:33:13,248
this and he said no but I'll help you be

672
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:17,298
the CEO and not fuck it up at at that

673
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:18,890
please I guess maybe and so actually

674
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:22,099
Ethan and I are started

675
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:24,320
company called breeders best and it's

676
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:26,000
really going to this isn't even a pitch

677
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:27,919
for that because there needs to be more

678
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,500
than one of these there needs to be a

679
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:33,080
whole whole ecosystem of companies like

680
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:37,190
this so that breeders have choices

681
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:38,509
my example of that is how how boring

682
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,390
would downtown be if there was one

683
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:43,250
restaurant and one bar there's got to be

684
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,470
there's got to be competition there's

685
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,089
got to be selection to really establish

686
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,009
what is a fair market and what is a

687
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:51,679
vibrant market and to give opportunities

688
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:53,690
to as many breeders as possible but

689
00:33:51,680 --> 00:34:01,370
we're the first ones to try this model I

690
00:33:53,690 --> 00:34:02,980
think and our goal is to figure out to

691
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:05,449
hopefully be good at identifying

692
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:09,619
cultivars that really have strong

693
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:12,039
potential and then protecting them the

694
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:13,880
breeder will own the the the rights

695
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:16,070
permanently the breeder owns the rights

696
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,898
we would be the licensee and we would

697
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:20,659
help them get this out to the world

698
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:23,449
and then probably the most exciting part

699
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:26,510
of this is that you've heard Ethan's

700
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:29,418
wish list he might now have access to a

701
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:31,970
whole RDR me like the world has never

702
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:35,989
seen before if we can communicate this

703
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:38,178
and we can enlist breeders to say hey we

704
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:40,039
can tell them go look see if you've got

705
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:45,139
this already you might already have this

706
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:47,059
and if you don't go make it Ethan wants

707
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:50,089
it and he's a rock star and he's gonna

708
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:52,159
make you famous so that's what we're

709
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:54,950
working on and we're excited about it it

710
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,039
it's this is not meant as a company

711
00:34:54,949 --> 00:35:00,859
pitch it's meant as having us all think

712
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:02,570
about the vast potential here and that

713
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,160
there are lots of ways to get from point

714
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:07,850
A to point B but we need to get from

715
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:10,099
point A to point B this is us taking a

716
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:11,809
shot at it but I just I want as many

717
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:14,710
breeders as possible to really succeed

718
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,710
at this yes

719
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:23,269
testing are we gonna be able to test

720
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:25,309
some of these things to sift them out

721
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:30,289
and figure out what they are is that

722
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:31,759
part of the I think if if we have that

723
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:34,579
they ever have the money right now we

724
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,530
have $10,000 in investment which is

725
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:39,349
pretty much paying for some t-shirts and

726
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:42,650
a booth that emerald-cut but you know to

727
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:45,110
start right if we had the money to do

728
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:47,000
that I would love to see some legacy

729
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:49,730
breeder brings his or her seed

730
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,250
collection and we grow them up and test

731
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:55,429
them one of the breeders that I'm that

732
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:57,619
I'm already working with he's a dear

733
00:35:55,429 --> 00:35:59,419
friend of mine now and he actually sent

734
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:03,319
some samples that we will be able to try

735
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:06,139
later on he he did a vegetative testing

736
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:11,300
at early stages of some seeds that he

737
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:13,929
obtained and found decently measurable

738
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:18,710
levels of THC v even in the leaves

739
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:19,940
selected some males cross them and he's

740
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,220
been working on this project for a few

741
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:25,400
years but what he gave me on my way up

742
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:28,309
here was a cultivar that is eight and a

743
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:33,320
half percent THC v and seventeen percent

744
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:37,099
THC and got a bottle of it that we can

745
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:39,140
try the point is that if we know what

746
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:41,779
we're looking for

747
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:43,489
and people have these incredible

748
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,470
collections and they have so much

749
00:36:43,489 --> 00:36:46,939
passion to to you know let's put the

750
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,289
chocolate with peanut butter together we

751
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,179
might get something that tastes good I

752
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:52,340
think there's incredible potential I

753
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:53,960
really do believe that it is old-school

754
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,610
plant breeders that are going to change

755
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,550
the face of medicine in the next couple

756
00:36:55,610 --> 00:37:01,460
generations absolutely and it's you it's

757
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:04,130
you and your friends I want to do what I

758
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,780
can to help with that but it's not it

759
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,590
doesn't depend on whether we do a good

760
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,670
job of this or not

761
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:12,440
it depends on opportunities like this

762
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:17,240
not only this but opportunities like

763
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,800
this for for this great army of breeders

764
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:23,209
I wanted to say one other thing that I'm

765
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:27,289
really excited about cannabinoids 11

766
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:28,490
through 150 we know that if if you can

767
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:30,710
find it

768
00:37:28,489 --> 00:37:32,209
if it's there it's going to do something

769
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:35,269
with a cannabinoid receptor because

770
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:37,670
that's what cannabinoids do right and so

771
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:39,739
one of the things that we're doing on

772
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:42,500
kind of a heavy science part of this

773
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:44,389
company is we're gonna look at and I

774
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,889
could talk about this now because we've

775
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:49,190
done what we need to do to protect it

776
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:51,710
but we're gonna look at not just flowers

777
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:54,079
you know if cannabinoids evolved as

778
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:56,690
defense molecules do you think the plant

779
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:00,289
might want to defend its roots and its

780
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:02,929
seedlings and its meristems we're gonna

781
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:05,809
look at other tissues to see what turns

782
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:08,419
on the cannabinoid receptors and if we

783
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:10,880
find some there well we'll go to the

784
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:13,430
breeder that that let us test this

785
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,910
material and say hey guess what you got

786
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:18,669
some cool genetics there if you want to

787
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:21,440
work on developing this cannabinoid

788
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,519
there could be a real pot of gold at the

789
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,559
end of the rainbow that's the kind of

790
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:28,009
thing that with investor support we

791
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:30,590
would fund but I really believe that the

792
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:33,410
discovery and use of cannabinoids 11

793
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:36,400
through infinity is gonna come from

794
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:39,109
old-school breeding that's what I think

795
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,880
thanks so much Dale and if we didn't

796
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,140
seem excited about your eight percent

797
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,410
THC v/o

798
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:48,049
we are we are we're excited to smoke

799
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:52,009
that later thirty four point nine five

800
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:56,060
percent total cannabinoids yeah mostly I

801
00:38:52,010 --> 00:39:01,310
will be exciting let's do that later

802
00:38:56,059 --> 00:39:03,829
yeah okay cool one thing yeah you know

803
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:07,909
what Dale said is not just theory I

804
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:11,119
can't say too much about this but one of

805
00:39:07,909 --> 00:39:15,500
those undiscovered cannabinoids has

806
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:19,279
shown recent testing to be an order of

807
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:22,250
magnitude more potent than THC so it

808
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,830
might explain why something tests at ten

809
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:26,320
percent but people are getting their

810
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:29,569
minds blown by it

811
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:33,500
so there's incredible potential out

812
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:35,840
there and again following on to what

813
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,539
Dale said we know a few of the

814
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,120
biosynthetic enzymes of the cannabinoids

815
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:42,050
and a little bit and the terpenoids but

816
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,809
how the plane

817
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:47,539
controls that turns on and off those

818
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:49,009
jeans has not been worked out at all and

819
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:54,639
these are the kinds of things we'd like

820
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:57,530
to work on but it will require having

821
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:59,809
the profiles that are worth

822
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:03,860
investigating to find out what makes

823
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:05,989
this particular Kimura var tick on you

824
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:08,480
know I can work on what it's good for

825
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:13,189
but again we'd love to give you the

826
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:19,250
targets and have you get to work awesome

827
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:22,010
and Ethan what about the four FS food

828
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:25,699
fibre fuel and pharmacy feel like you

829
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:28,190
covered that yeah okay well again you

830
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:31,460
know I'm fond of saying that if you're

831
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:33,800
on the proverbial desert island and had

832
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:38,480
to pick one plant of course it should be

833
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:44,090
cannabis we've been talking about maybe

834
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:49,340
second yeah but unlike the potato with

835
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:53,600
cannabis you not only have food you can

836
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:55,970
have medicine you can have clothing you

837
00:40:53,599 --> 00:41:06,679
can have fuel I I think it's hard to

838
00:40:55,969 --> 00:41:09,019
burn a potato but yeah another thing I

839
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:11,480
wanted to emphasize is as mentioned

840
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:14,210
other parts of the plant can be really

841
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:17,030
valuable you're all familiar with fiber

842
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:21,199
I'm a walking Patagonia and I'm wearing

843
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:23,930
a good amount of hemp myself but beyond

844
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:27,980
that I mentioned the fan leaves before

845
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:30,619
they actually contain a 0.2 percent of a

846
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:34,579
thing called canna preen which is a very

847
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:37,609
promising anti-inflammatory agent and

848
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:40,159
right now going to waste nothing's been

849
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:43,220
done with that I think you're probably

850
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:47,359
familiar with hemp seed nutrition one of

851
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:50,809
the most complete dietary ingredients on

852
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:53,559
earth having very important essential

853
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:56,099
fatty acids as well as a high quality

854
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:58,889
digestible protein called it deaths

855
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:02,610
this is in comparison to soybeans that

856
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:06,629
can name contain genestein which is

857
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:10,470
actually very bad for your gut

858
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:13,260
there were soybeans were described in

859
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:14,519
China for a thousand years before they

860
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:17,760
appeared in the diet

861
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:20,519
no took them a thousand years to figure

862
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,400
out how to use them in a way that wasn't

863
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:24,509
bad nutritionally and that's why in

864
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,809
Chinese food

865
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:31,740
you see sprouts and fermented products

866
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:36,049
you don't see raw soybeans being used so

867
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:38,939
I'm not an edamame fan I will say that

868
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:42,060
so if I turn those down at your meal you

869
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:44,340
know why and then we've got the roots

870
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:47,150
the roots are have been used

871
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:51,150
traditionally in medicine for as long as

872
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:53,460
the flowers have interestingly they

873
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:57,360
don't contain any cannabinoids but they

874
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:59,849
have very important other benefits trace

875
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:03,090
amount of alkaloids and things called

876
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:05,339
tri terpenoids which again very

877
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:09,390
importantly anti-inflammatory and

878
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:12,950
anti-cancer effects and Deol mentioned

879
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:16,309
the flavonoids I'll just talk about one

880
00:43:12,949 --> 00:43:19,019
flavonoids are very important

881
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:21,599
antioxidant molecules so if you have a

882
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:25,739
lot of good vegetables in the diet

883
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:30,719
you'll be exposed exposed to flavonoids

884
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:33,109
and these will exert benefit on helping

885
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:38,849
to prevent cancer and things like that

886
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:41,820
one in particular can flavin a and B can

887
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:43,589
Flavin's are unique to cannabis they

888
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:46,350
haven't been found in any other plant

889
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:49,440
they have an anti-inflammatory profile

890
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:51,929
that is considered ideal in that they

891
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,950
have the benefits of anti-inflammatories

892
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:57,929
without the liabilities of the

893
00:43:54,949 --> 00:44:02,250
non-steroidal anti-inflammatories which

894
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:05,909
are all acting through on enzyme cox-1

895
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:08,099
or cox-2 but the side effects of those

896
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,009
are well known they produce ulcers they

897
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:11,619
can produce art

898
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:14,620
attacks or strokes can't flavin doesn't

899
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:17,230
have that activity and should not have

900
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:21,130
those side effects so these are again

901
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:26,199
just a few of the products that we could

902
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:31,260
extract or produce from cannabis beyond

903
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:31,259
the flower thank you so much
