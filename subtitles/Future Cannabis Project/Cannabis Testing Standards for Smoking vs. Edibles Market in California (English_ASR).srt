00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:17,429
Kevin Joe dree can you talk to us about

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:21,740
how you think the emergency regulations

4
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:25,710
are going to impact the climate of

5
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:27,809
cannabis for the farmers of the Emerald

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,929
triangle and California in general

7
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:32,729
what's your perspective well I had a

8
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:34,949
perspective that I thought was right

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,919
because I'm trying to study the

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:41,780
regulations on a really common basis and

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,570
it looked like it was exceptionally

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:48,210
stringent on mold levels East levels

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,460
which is active culture in general it

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,780
was very stringent and pesticide usages

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,308
and fungicide usages the level of

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,890
contaminants allowed visibly on a

17
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:03,030
product was it was exceptionally limited

18
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,189
and so to me the regulations were

19
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,478
difficult to get product to the store

20
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,149
because it was gonna be very difficult

21
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,829
to find cultivars that could handle the

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,900
fungal pressure without using

23
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:14,728
adulterants it was going to be difficult

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,909
to be able to do certain situations

25
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:20,759
because of just pathogenic pressure or

26
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,219
pest pressure and so I was up late last

27
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,689
night I couldn't sleep and I started

28
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:25,950
doing some research and I I dug up some

29
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:28,500
weird stuff and it was really from

30
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,900
project CBD and it was a article from

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,840
called bugs mold and excrement and what

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,000
it was was it was on November 16th they

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,799
said they released this new set of rules

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,629
and when I went online into the

35
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,159
California site I can't find this

36
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:47,280
information but this basically is a

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,460
a change in how California is going to

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,950
deal with pesticide usage I think they

39
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,319
went from 42 banned down to 21 banned

40
00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,240
some of the ones that you can use now is

41
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:03,029
I've met them which is avid you can use

42
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,618
bifenthrin which is a termite killer

43
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,550
then use that typically for rude aphids

44
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:09,868
and so in you know some of the testing

45
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,850
we've seen over the course of the years

46
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:13,469
that bifenthrin was in maybe 65% of the

47
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,090
bay area cannabis because there's a

48
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,400
hydroponic view taken situations so in a

49
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,439
lot of these large cultural type of

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,480
media when they share things a rude a

51
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,909
fit is just a savage predator to all of

52
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,919
us and so typically we use funguses then

53
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:27,359
we inoculate and it kills it from a

54
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,979
fungal point of view we're actually

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,019
infects the plant that I mean affects

56
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,268
the the body of the creature itself and

57
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,550
breaks them down but by difference a

58
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:39,750
terma Killa but it's a heavy carcinogen

59
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,269
and they're allowing some form of like a

60
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,469
mosquito side and then that's an app

61
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:46,560
every theme based and then they're

62
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:49,409
allowing something else for so the

63
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,409
Promethean based the insecticide used

64
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:54,150
for killing mosquitoes bifenthrin was

65
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:56,069
the one that really caught my eye and

66
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,870
avid and now these things are things

67
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,810
that we like have been sifting out of

68
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,280
the lab and excluding from dispensaries

69
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,750
for the whole time I've been in cannabis

70
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,930
ever since I got into cannabis and we

71
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,430
started having lab tested cannabis these

72
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,439
were some of the main things that were

73
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,900
we're disqualifying you from selling

74
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,879
your product at the store and so now

75
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,209
those things are allowed in production

76
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,969
for not consumption and smoke form but

77
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,530
in edible form and so if the cannabis is

78
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,479
destined to be turned into a product

79
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,860
made for edibles any of those products

80
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,399
are allowed to be found in trace amounts

81
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,609
in it which means that really you could

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,200
probably use it on anything and if the

83
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:35,609
levels don't appear in it because if it

84
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,229
was used by Ventura and all these things

85
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:40,829
typically uses like nursery operations

86
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:42,750
too so it changes the the way these

87
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,879
plants hold these toxins and residuals

88
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,409
and it was just so weird to me because I

89
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,449
couldn't find substantiation in the

90
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:50,479
California regs but this is all stating

91
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:51,469
other regulations through

92
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,229
project secret he's usually pretty

93
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:55,609
accurate and so the next one that caught

94
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:58,340
my eye was where they were only gonna

95
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:02,290
check for three major bacterial groups

96
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:04,969
was e.coli aspera gist and salmonella

97
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:06,259
nothing else nothing else they were

98
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:07,789
gonna look for in any way shape or form

99
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:08,899
it didn't matter what the yeast counts

100
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,179
were it didn't matter what the any of

101
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,330
the counts were you could have up to 25%

102
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:18,500
of the flour with visible mold and it

103
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:20,478
was still sellable and it was just kind

104
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,399
of shocking because we just went through

105
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,899
this incredible purge on what could

106
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,879
enter the system this year and what

107
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:27,379
couldn't enter the system so many of us

108
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,969
are getting beat up at the events on

109
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:30,769
fund a little fungal levels

110
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,570
and we're trying to learn how to comply

111
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:35,959
with these fungal regulations and now

112
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:38,288
basically it's 25% of the product it it

113
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:41,209
was 25% of the product could have

114
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:44,329
fungal problems or any kind of coverage

115
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:48,769
dirt contamination and you were allowed

116
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:50,680
to have on a gram was it maybe three

117
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:54,168
point five with an eighth one drop of

118
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,780
insect mammalian excrement which means

119
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:59,120
rat shit so if you had a chocolate bar

120
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:01,459
that was an ounce and he broke it up

121
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,530
into 16 pieces four of them could be

122
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:05,598
covered in dirt floor could be covered

123
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:08,569
in mold and all of them had a single

124
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:11,629
drop a rat shit on it that's legal and

125
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:13,069
it freaked me out so like it freaked me

126
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:15,589
out so much again this is just for

127
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:18,769
edibles this is yes there's a feeling

128
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:20,418
that our digestive system exactly break

129
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:23,149
anything die and what they're using for

130
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:24,978
cannabis is tobacco and so what they did

131
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:26,299
is they they backed up so they they took

132
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:28,788
all these different pesticides out of

133
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:33,470
the program but they basically copied

134
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:35,930
cannabis treatment for pathogenic

135
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,080
pressure for pests pressure using these

136
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,000
chemical families same as you can use in

137
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,800
tobacco so they're mirroring that but

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,759
they pulled aside all these others

139
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,550
because you can remember

140
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,370
Aven is a great miticide but it's

141
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,189
designed for mentals and bifenthrin is a

142
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,629
termite killer that toxified the ground

143
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:56,240
it's in and it makes it to where there's

144
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:57,709
a residual that stays in the plants but

145
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,769
so it's one of those problems like my

146
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:01,598
tribunal where it's a it's a

147
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:03,939
a family that lives in the tissue of the

148
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:06,219
planet a cellular level for a really

149
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:09,490
long time and so you have these things

150
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,599
that are known problems and it just

151
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,180
tripped me out that we've been preparing

152
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:15,189
for this incredibly stringent regulated

153
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,050
system and I'm worried that we're not

154
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:19,180
gonna see any cultivars make it into the

155
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,949
system because the regulations are gonna

156
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,090
be so honest and lo and behold I go home

157
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:23,408
last night and I find out that

158
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:25,929
everything that I'm preparing for is

159
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:28,089
actually not even existence and no one I

160
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,959
know has even seen any of this paperwork

161
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:34,598
and so it's on the net and it's carted

162
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,399
so it's just a question of you know what

163
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:38,978
what regulations that we following

164
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,049
because I would like to know because if

165
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:43,689
if you're gonna have this type of

166
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,490
situation occur it radically changes you

167
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:46,629
know how you approach all of it because

168
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,728
if you're an organic farmer and they

169
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:50,769
allow you to use these tools and you

170
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:52,508
have to compete at a price point do you

171
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:54,399
use the tools of what do you switch into

172
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:55,569
growing because you're either toxifying

173
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,538
the ground you use them with some of

174
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:59,680
this stuff and for a lot of individuals

175
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:01,389
you know that's a really that's the

176
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,668
biggest market is the distillate market

177
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:05,139
and so the distillate market is the one

178
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:07,568
that's really going to be the the most

179
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:08,949
burgeoning as we go forward and so it's

180
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:12,610
one of the more crucial ones to have

181
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:15,098
access into as it grows and there it's

182
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,840
almost too big right now it if satisfied

183
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:18,728
completely or you wouldn't see so many

184
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:21,218
people trying to grab products that they

185
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:22,959
grab and so the ability to enter that

186
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:24,459
market would be fantastic but the

187
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,168
product that we pass through because

188
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:27,879
then it lets us use cultivars that are

189
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:29,680
bulky and weighty and come in on a good

190
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,569
time frame and we're not worrying about

191
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,860
the quality of the flower parents we

192
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:34,710
just need to go organically produce

193
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,509
product or what we believe to be

194
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:39,549
California regulated product but now you

195
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:41,710
can use stuff that you have never been

196
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,848
able to use in cannabis production in

197
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,228
all the years we've been selling

198
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:45,728
cannabis and they started having lab

199
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:47,949
tests avid was the number one ingredient

200
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:49,269
they went after first avid and then the

201
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:51,098
other families flora it's all these

202
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:53,079
different chemical families that they've

203
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:54,250
used to attack bugs for time because

204
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,870
once they get a resistance you guys

205
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,339
switched through the family and so

206
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,699
people have been rotating through this

207
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:02,198
forbid pylon avid flora Mike and

208
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:05,949
whatever other products they're using

209
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,478
and so those were all these families and

210
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:08,978
and now you're able to get back into

211
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,310
some of this stuff and so it changes a

212
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:14,039
lot for us because for us that our

213
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,019
we minded where we ethically want to

214
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,640
grow clean pot but we're also trying to

215
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:19,259
work under this situation where I'm

216
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,509
fighting spider mites with neem and

217
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:23,009
you're fighting spider mites with it

218
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:25,259
with it Oh beside it so it's hard to

219
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,639
kind of compete and so that's the part

220
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,899
that's tripping me out yesterday I

221
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,129
figured we were all gonna have a hard

222
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,469
time because it was gonna be a very

223
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,820
difficult situation to get into now you

224
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,560
have a hard time because you're gonna

225
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,330
get to compete against people who are

226
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,339
using tools that you wouldn't use at

227
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,530
your house you wouldn't use it your home

228
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,519
farm you know you're gonna go you want

229
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:43,049
to spray this in the greenhouse that's

230
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,699
great is that greenhouse in your yard

231
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,929
because one of the products when I

232
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,960
looked up what did what it was connected

233
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:51,539
to it was the mosquito killer but used

234
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,980
for Zika virus and it's oh wow I'm not

235
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:54,929
putting the cross reference what they

236
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,360
were using a foreign egg so I couldn't

237
00:08:54,929 --> 00:09:00,389
find really what were they use in this

238
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,470
for in what we do but they're allowed to

239
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:06,990
use it and it's connected to childhood

240
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,029
development the mental stuff so you're

241
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,830
having brain development issues that it

242
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:13,110
was directly I could find that that link

243
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:16,259
pop right up but what it was used for

244
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,870
outside of kill and Zika virus it didn't

245
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,399
have an applicability so I I couldn't I

246
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,139
couldn't I have to get all the chemists

247
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,559
and say hey Heidi what is this transfer

248
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:28,889
and and I wonder if that's coming from

249
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:30,799
one department that regulations like

250
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:34,039
Public Health so it's looking at what's

251
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:37,319
legal to consume but then if you look at

252
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:39,000
outdoor cultivation regulations is that

253
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,680
going to conflict in terms of what

254
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,600
you're allowed to put in the environment

255
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,419
and so maybe that's a really for indoor

256
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,159
no it talked about it it talked about it

257
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,779
specifically saying that they couldn't

258
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,309
believe they allowed these things that's

259
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,500
in the article they couldn't believe

260
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:54,539
that these things were allowed to pass

261
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,909
through not because of the toxins to the

262
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:58,889
people because watershed damage so they

263
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:01,740
it had it that's fully known but that

264
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,090
the that the problems that you have with

265
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,430
these type of contaminants move

266
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,070
downstream and then migrate through the

267
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:10,139
ecosystem and so that it's fully known

268
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,050
gonna be in the article reveal it so if

269
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:14,699
it's if it's the full awareness of these

270
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:16,620
products and what they do and so

271
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,940
the financial concerns had to have

272
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,909
affected this to make that possible

273
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:24,150
because it makes it so simple to grow

274
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:27,419
fields because you with Aven you don't

275
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:29,309
have my problems but a vit yeah you

276
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,110
don't have them you don't have rude

277
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:33,479
aphid problems with bifenthrin its

278
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,220
termite killa it'll kill termites if you

279
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,159
can kill a termite you can kill a rude

280
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,710
aphid and so when you have these tools

281
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,709
and then you have high like synthetic

282
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:47,330
parathion creations to use as other

283
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:49,710
bombs to utilize but they're also

284
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:52,500
problematic in there and what they do

285
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:54,509
but those are incredible tools as pest

286
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,120
control it's just not for what we're

287
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:58,679
allowed to use traditionally and then

288
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,299
I'm not sure why you use the mosquito

289
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,529
killer because it didn't it just didn't

290
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:02,909
tie in it I didn't find a

291
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:04,829
cross-reference on what are the pests

292
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:06,899
that it killed other than you know

293
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,360
controlling mosquito populations and

294
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,470
maybe maybe the areas around the place

295
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,779
they wanted to work with I'm not sure

296
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,670
and I believe that the fungal sifting

297
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,639
was going to knock the living daylights

298
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:19,110
out of the the totals but now when I

299
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,419
read this article last night I realized

300
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,680
look wait a minute and I went back and

301
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,789
looked through all the California stuff

302
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,239
and I couldn't find the reconciliation

303
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:30,329
but the bottom line is if the laws are

304
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,159
changing so fast that when I look at the

305
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,200
San Francisco headline and it said one

306
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,659
acre cap installed no commercial

307
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,390
takeover cannabis we all laud it the

308
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:41,819
incredible victory by the time I got

309
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:43,860
home it was an army look at a newspaper

310
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,340
and good home no one on the Internet and

311
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,860
it said cap completely wiped out so if

312
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,780
it happened after it happened I mean

313
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,639
first they told us it was good and we

314
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,529
all celebrate for about 17 minutes and

315
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,210
then we read the news on another news

316
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:58,860
service and it tells us no that's not

317
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,320
real at all and you don't have a capital

318
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,129
and so when I read this I realized it

319
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:08,340
must be the same thing it's just too

320
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:11,269
much velocity in what's taking place for

321
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:14,670
any one site to have all the information

322
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:16,860
accurately because the California site

323
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:17,789
should be the most accurate when you go

324
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,899
through I went through all the web

325
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:21,240
process I'm going through all these

326
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,759
things I like in as if I wasn't doing it

327
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,750
in real life and I don't have people

328
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,049
working with me so I'm just going

329
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,730
through myself to see all

330
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:30,909
little pieces and understand this and

331
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,909
and and it's a very it's a very complex

332
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:36,219
system to get into the registry but all

333
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:37,958
the regulations you know it must be so

334
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,430
complex that when you have stuff like

335
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,750
this happen how do you update it this

336
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:42,879
quick and change it because they're

337
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,789
still working off of I can use mean I

338
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:48,278
can use my control I can use before see

339
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:50,980
barbaric I can use fungal controllers I

340
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:52,689
think I can use some sulfur I can use

341
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,879
some potassium bicarbonate I'm talking a

342
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,640
really restrictive organic regimen and

343
00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:00,100
that's still what's up on the regulatory

344
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:03,490
controls for the state and I couldn't

345
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,200
find these to reconcile but you know

346
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,879
once you start to have the ability to do

347
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,370
this I mean you start to have an ability

348
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,899
to you know we go through the whole list

349
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,328
and find out what else but these are

350
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:15,159
incredible tools to change your

351
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:18,278
efficiency and effectiveness a growing

352
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:21,879
cannabis on a large level so do you

353
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:25,240
think that it's something that you'd

354
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:28,299
like to see stay in place or you know

355
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,850
would you like to see I mean the mold

356
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:33,490
counts for one thing this seems like

357
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:36,639
it's only for edibles so you've got the

358
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,659
whole anybody doing flour or even for

359
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,250
bake pens

360
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:42,189
well we probably have to stay away from

361
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,620
all of this soon so edibles is not that

362
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:48,390
large it's a good percentage of the

363
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:52,480
market but edibles are still you know a

364
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:55,360
fraction of the whole pie so you know

365
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,620
it's it'll be interesting to see but I

366
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,278
don't think it's the direction that

367
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:03,570
people wanted to see that want to make

368
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:06,850
sure that the environment still being

369
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:10,028
improved better than it has under the

370
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,680
black market yeah you know you'll have

371
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:15,519
wheel you'll have a lot more control of

372
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:17,588
what they're saying but you you have if

373
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,659
you're allowing this stuff it's a

374
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:21,130
progression that's how I see these

375
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:24,079
things so yeah

376
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:26,090
aníbal production is maybe say what's

377
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,710
call it 20% of the pie here of what's

378
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,149
what's going into cuz it's gonna it's

379
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:32,480
gonna be big because it's the delivery

380
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:34,220
system people prefer the new people that

381
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,720
aren't smokers and consumption is clean

382
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:40,070
if there's no no stigma to eating it and

383
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,570
the quality of the edible products is

384
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,670
incredible right now in its diversity

385
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,340
and complexity so you know it's gonna

386
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:48,319
it's gonna be big and so the thing is

387
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,210
that you you start to get people used to

388
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,900
consuming products that we're never

389
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,980
meant to be ingested period so so does

390
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:57,590
that mean that the nurseries that

391
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,300
produce the clones that go to the farms

392
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,610
that produce this do they are they

393
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:04,309
allowed to use that product to like is

394
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,720
if you can use it but is there no we

395
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:06,349
don't catch you with the residual it's

396
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,639
okay

397
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,080
meaning that we don't mind if it's in

398
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,669
your spray cabinet it's in your spray

399
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,129
logs it's just that it can't come up hot

400
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:16,029
on the product don't we DQ it you know

401
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:18,340
so it starts like a slippery slope of

402
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:21,319
accountability on how you're growing

403
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:24,410
agriculturally and this whole thing with

404
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,950
cannabis was basically this clean

405
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:30,230
revolution of people trying to say let's

406
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,030
not destroy the watersheds and on-ball

407
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,850
let's not destroy the watersheds in

408
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:38,750
Mendocino let's not do all these things

409
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:41,330
that are traditionally done with

410
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,970
industrial logging practices industrial

411
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:46,520
mining practices and so we were kind of

412
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,379
held to that incredible stringent sino

413
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,360
sediment runoff from your property so I

414
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:52,490
mean everything must be contained that's

415
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,129
expensive and now all of a sudden if I

416
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,450
decide that I want to produce distillate

417
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:58,460
which I recommend people to do because

418
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:02,390
it's it allows you to get a simpler

419
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:04,160
product line in the market then all of a

420
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:06,230
sudden you're now spraying all of your

421
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,360
property all these chemicals and it's

422
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,100
totally cool

423
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,990
so my neighbor next to me above me on

424
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,540
the watershed is now dumping this crap

425
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,549
into his ground and now with it we're

426
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:18,799
gonna toxify all the stuff that we just

427
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:19,609
did all this work on I don't want to do

428
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:21,469
to God baloney

429
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,690
and so I think it's a horrible thing

430
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:26,930
because I think that they need to work

431
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:28,670
on mold differentiation better versus

432
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:31,069
just saying look if you if the flowers

433
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:31,879
coming with 25% of dirt it's still

434
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,389
allowed

435
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:36,799
that's just that's just commercial

436
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:40,399
that's treatment like it spits its

437
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:44,448
produce and the problem is is that it's

438
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,278
it allows there to be almost no handwork

439
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:47,838
whatsoever because how can you compete

440
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:49,100
at a price point when you can come when

441
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,829
you can just basically cover your

442
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,680
cannabis in mud cover it in dirt because

443
00:16:51,828 --> 00:16:57,859
they're saying this is for edible pieces

444
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:59,028
but it begins a 25% of the market can be

445
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,680
contaminated and we're not going to

446
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:03,169
assume it's going to change as it goes

447
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:04,519
forward and and it's hard for us you

448
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:06,349
know and we've been we've been saying

449
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,970
this is important as craft producers to

450
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:15,859
have differentiation I still believe it

451
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:18,169
is it's just that it is is it possible

452
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:22,038
to compete with them if they can

453
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:23,538
chemically get the cost so low because

454
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:25,099
once we start to get this into these

455
00:17:23,538 --> 00:17:26,720
lower basements all of a sudden it

456
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,849
becomes a very difficult situation to

457
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,100
have craft cannabis if there's no

458
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:32,750
pricing point and so I don't know if

459
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:34,579
they have the ability right now to drive

460
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,669
this market so deep because the

461
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:39,829
infrastructure isn't fully established

462
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:42,350
allows it these added pesticides are

463
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:45,500
allowed in the marketplace and on farms

464
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:48,109
you're gonna have a farm inevitably

465
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,019
that's working to be all organic and

466
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:53,178
their neighbors using all these things

467
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:55,879
like avid and so you're gonna get drift

468
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:59,269
so it causes a lot of problems whereas

469
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:02,630
before we thought that we really thought

470
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:04,279
that cannabis was going to be held to a

471
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,220
much higher standard than other

472
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:09,980
agriculture and it sounds like big egg

473
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,730
and all its dirty practices are coming

474
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,240
into

475
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:16,220
cannabis really fast yeah and if they

476
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,650
had said to us you know a long time ago

477
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,798
hey we're gonna do it this way then then

478
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:23,030
it would have influenced the entire

479
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,200
regulation of the call the codes and

480
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:25,730
there's all this everything would have

481
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,240
been the beginning of like look look

482
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:31,009
this is gonna be toxins everywhere and

483
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,319
it didn't go like that so what you have

484
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:36,140
is you have the ability to grow for

485
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:37,700
whatever market you want and if you know

486
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,080
if you're a medical you can go vatika

487
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,880
Brecht you can go rec but if you go in

488
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:42,740
rec you can go edible and a few medical

489
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,040
you can go edible and so if you have a

490
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,690
for a cup you for a pee ends with four

491
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:51,859
acres sitting next to each other on it

492
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:53,660
and you're using these products you get

493
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:55,548
at a level and now you have to follow

494
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,630
protocol and it's gonna be spray logs

495
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:59,990
and you're gonna have to go and get a

496
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,880
spray license like Pedro has and that'll

497
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,319
that'll force you to do which is

498
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,650
everything that goes on the plant has

499
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:09,289
been logged and sent to the regulatory

500
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,240
control on the AG level over in Eureka

501
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,859
now it'll go through the cannabis board

502
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,298
in addition so there'll be multiple

503
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:17,659
people who are looking at what you're

504
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:19,490
doing but we've been doing it for a long

505
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,470
time just because it starts a protocol

506
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,839
so you understand how to comply because

507
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,789
it's complicated everything in zones and

508
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,299
what was done and how much was used and

509
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,940
then

510
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:31,069
the control practices and the time you

511
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,380
have to wait to reenter and all these

512
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:36,109
components go with it but when you start

513
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,780
to be able to use chemical AG and in

514
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:41,209
products that were I don't mind it I

515
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:44,000
wouldn't be so so tripped out on it if

516
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:47,150
it was chemicals that were meant for

517
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,250
human consumption that were meant for

518
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,590
human consumption where even though I'm

519
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,990
not a chemical guy it was at least

520
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:56,389
tested for people on health when they

521
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,690
ate it but that's not what these

522
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:02,150
products are for these products are for

523
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:04,580
non ingestible and so when you're taking

524
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:08,470
termite killa and you're taking a

525
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:11,210
miticide and all the side that is

526
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,730
ornamental based horticultural based and

527
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,759
is in these things are known toxins and

528
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,309
you're just saying it's okay it just

529
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,440
kind of makes you wonder like what about

530
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:23,539
laws am i preparing for and that's what

531
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,779
I said yesterday I think that the

532
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:28,579
small-scale black-market person who is

533
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:30,170
able to just keep themselves alive in

534
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:32,210
the interim they'll probably survive

535
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,580
more than anyone else will because

536
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,740
everyone else is is financially gonna

537
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:38,449
have to compete and for all of us that

538
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,190
are trying to do an organic operation

539
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:43,400
these kinds of things make it difficult

540
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:45,620
I like to change in molds but I don't

541
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,060
like to change in 25% of the total fraud

542
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,439
product to be covered in mold because

543
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,899
now we're not looking at poverty mildew

544
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,340
which is a lung irritant and we don't

545
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,850
want that we would like to have levels

546
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:59,720
of it that are acceptable and fair and

547
00:20:55,849 --> 00:21:01,129
and those things can be worked out but

548
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,110
when it's just our edges cover it with

549
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,700
dirt or any kind of foreign contaminant

550
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:05,869
so it could be covered in leaf material

551
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,390
could be covered in thistle doesn't make

552
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:11,029
a difference 25 percent of the flowers

553
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:14,390
so if you have a one gram flour 0.25 of

554
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:16,940
it could be dipped in in Denmark or you

555
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,980
dip it in anything else you want and

556
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,920
that's coal totally okay all moldy mold

557
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,960
yeah 25% of total so these are like

558
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,630
that's a lot you wouldn't buy that now

559
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:29,840
if you bought a pound in 25% of it four

560
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:31,150
ounces were moldy you would be like whoa

561
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:35,019
that's legal

562
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:36,640
and so in it's trippy because I think a

563
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:39,670
lot of it is because of the penalties

564
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,050
and so I started to take a look I went

565
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,779
back for me and so I looked at this

566
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:45,700
thing and I went into the penalty phases

567
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:47,529
if you make a mistake with your permits

568
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,690
so you have a level 1 or level 2 and a

569
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:52,480
level 3 only a couple things give you a

570
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,430
level 1 which is the least punitive and

571
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,529
there's a couple to give you a level two

572
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:59,019
but there is an ocean of them to give

573
00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:01,180
you a level three and a level three was

574
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:03,250
if you have pathogenic material on

575
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:07,210
nursery plants made in rude athens or

576
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:08,558
mites and so by my thing is like well

577
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,990
those are the two things that are the

578
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,819
most dominant pervasively used chemicals

579
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,279
to control those two problems and when

580
00:22:12,819 --> 00:22:17,500
you look at Bay Area cannabis

581
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:19,509
traditionally you just like when you

582
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,279
look at you know outdoor couch pot and

583
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:22,660
then into a coach pot you see maybe up

584
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,819
to 80 percent my computer and all

585
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,410
contamination through lab tests if

586
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:28,089
you're looking at Bay Area hydro

587
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,750
cannabis primarily you're looking at

588
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:34,000
almost like 65 percent bifenthrin over

589
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,980
like the last couple years and so it's

590
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,380
just so used because it's just very

591
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,730
effective and it's cheap and if you're

592
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,740
trying to do with the way we're doing it

593
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,360
with with with with fungal additives so

594
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,609
that you can let the plants back it off

595
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,750
themselves in this form it doesn't ever

596
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:51,039
really work you're in a perpetual

597
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:54,009
never-ending cycle of it and it's just

598
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,990
what it is but that is a tool that

599
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:57,849
allows you to have an incredible

600
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,759
efficiency so you never get a violation

601
00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:02,230
you never any kind of issue and we've

602
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,549
wondered all of us have wondered and all

603
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,110
the nursery guys we're all wondering how

604
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:08,019
you're gonna pull this off because

605
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:10,269
everybody is judgmental on on their

606
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,650
their nursery operation but most people

607
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:13,000
have a couple trades of clones and a mom

608
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,640
in the closet they're like I can do a

609
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,529
great job but when you produce and 365

610
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,140
days a year and you're in any situation

611
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:23,059
where this

612
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:24,980
you end up having a very different

613
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:28,609
situation than her it's tough to keep

614
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:32,730
these things moving on this level and

615
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:34,199
the ability to be able to protect

616
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,019
yourself chemically from any kind of

617
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,400
violations and so we wondered how we

618
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:41,069
were going to be able to work with some

619
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,240
of this and now I haven't had a chance

620
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:43,919
to talk to any of the other nursery

621
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,509
operators I know yet just because when I

622
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,170
read this but I'm like what what changes

623
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:49,410
everything

624
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:52,170
because suddenly you know he's 25% of

625
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:54,300
your nursery now for sale only to food

626
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,190
because can we back the whole chain up

627
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,659
if it if we can use it on producing the

628
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,100
product then why wouldn't be we be able

629
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,960
to use it on producing the clones that

630
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:02,789
produce the product what's the

631
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,090
difference it's all the same product

632
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:09,420
it's a track system so when can I apply

633
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:10,799
the toxins where do they get applied in

634
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,940
this chain because they might as well

635
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,490
get applied early if you're gonna use

636
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,559
them late there's no difference and so

637
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,269
you know a lot of this stuff is it's

638
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,740
competitive in different ways than you

639
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:22,589
believe because it allows you to

640
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,509
efficiently control problems but not

641
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:28,079
don't bring your bottom line down but

642
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:31,049
keep you out of punitive financial

643
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:34,619
punishments and regulatory and they can

644
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:36,509
go back seven years on this so with you

645
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:38,669
know yeah that's a good point but in

646
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:42,000
terms of records of your cultivation

647
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:45,480
product practices or even manufacturing

648
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,130
any of the licenses you have it's seven

649
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,490
years of records and they have that

650
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:53,010
seven years to so you could get fined

651
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:56,190
for something they're looking at that

652
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:58,200
happened seven years ago mm-hmm if your

653
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:01,920
records aren't kept properly and then

654
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:05,340
you face fines that they come after you

655
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,200
for and assess you fines and so you know

656
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:09,058
so much of this is important not to make

657
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,590
these mistakes

658
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:16,138
and it's just that you know we we've all

659
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:18,509
been under the same exact premise that

660
00:25:16,138 --> 00:25:20,099
we're gonna work off of this extremely

661
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:21,808
regulated I just spoke on a panel at the

662
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:23,939
America bamaca microbial contamination

663
00:25:21,808 --> 00:25:26,128
and I was talking to a very intelligent

664
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,379
lab operator from one of the labs she

665
00:25:26,128 --> 00:25:30,538
was us speak on the panel and we never

666
00:25:28,378 --> 00:25:32,969
we never talked about they still talked

667
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:35,190
about basically identifying mold levels

668
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,870
and working on spore counts we

669
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:41,100
understood that as per religious had a

670
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:42,748
higher level of tolerance it was to go

671
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:44,788
to the animal market but they didn't

672
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:49,409
talk about 25% of the flour Covenant and

673
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:52,200
mold so I mean I'm not sure it's hard to

674
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:54,659
keep track if and I don't think that I'm

675
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,159
so so good at pulling info off the web I

676
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,720
just happen to be up late last night at

677
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,519
4:00 in the morning and couldn't sleep

678
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:04,200
and I pulled up this information and but

679
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,368
it seems like it's pretty accurate and

680
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,950
makes sense and so of course it's

681
00:26:05,368 --> 00:26:11,189
problems for all of us it it just

682
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:13,558
creates a situation where it absolutely

683
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,990
favors a very specific production

684
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:17,819
methodology and we saw that with the

685
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,079
unlimited canopy but we figured hey I

686
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:21,628
have to at least work off of some of the

687
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,038
same operating standards and now what

688
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:24,959
you do is you get to use all these

689
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,398
salinas operations and all these

690
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,200
monterey operations that are

691
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:31,229
historically covered in these these

692
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,940
things and so if they can't get cannabis

693
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,730
to pass because the soil is bifenthrin

694
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,200
saturated water down canada and if they

695
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,058
can't get things to remember these are

696
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,100
all residuals and so stuff that they've

697
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:42,058
used for years and all these facilities

698
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,740
and all these places

699
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,509
toxins just like a lot of the rural

700
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,909
buildings and so um that that

701
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:49,589
at equal 20 applied continuously that

702
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:51,690
stuff is still active in the room and

703
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:53,730
when cannabis is grown in it pieces of

704
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:55,649
it fall off the ceiling and literally

705
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:57,120
land on your flowers and it comes up hot

706
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:58,829
as people go I'm not using it I don't

707
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,538
know why it's tested on because the

708
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:02,129
building had it sprayed in a dryer and

709
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:04,829
if you don't have UV it might take five

710
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,720
years for that to break down and so we

711
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:08,519
don't see the same amount of it anymore

712
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,990
because people sealed up their spaces

713
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:13,109
and you don't see the applications as

714
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:14,460
much but the bottom line is we're all

715
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:17,548
working off in this incredible control

716
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:20,160
system to do quality work and now we

717
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:22,220
just have to understand where we go

718
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,220
you

719
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:31,390
