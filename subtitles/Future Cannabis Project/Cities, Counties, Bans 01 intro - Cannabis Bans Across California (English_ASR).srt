group that Susan says I started um but

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,118
I'm I'm here today because I am forever

6
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,479
indebted to a plant and the people

7
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,600
provided for me in this room today I

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,599
thank all of you that that risk their

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,399
lives and their safety um in order to be

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,600
in this industry um so at the beginning

11
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,799
of this year I I began a Facebook group

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,320
called California City and County bandat

13
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,359
if you're not a member and you're

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,198
looking to be up to date on current

15
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:57,238
marijuana policy in the state I'm

16
00:00:53,198 --> 00:01:00,679
obsessed um I saw uh the first wave of

17
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:04,640
bands hit our uh state after the passage

18
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:07,759
of Mera last year and in November I I

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,359
saw about 10 come through in one day and

20
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,280
I realized that there was something

21
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,759
going on that we weren't aware of and uh

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,359
the reason that I saw this was due to

23
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,040
some Google Alerts that I had set up uh

24
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,239
my background is I worked on Wall Street

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,159
for 18 years as a stock broker so I am a

26
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:27,399
research junkie I crave information and

27
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,200
um I saw this first wave come through

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,040
and I didn't know I didn't understand

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,359
and I I I I knew there had to be other

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,920
people out there that wanted you know

31
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:39,519
more information like this so on January

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:43,040
2nd I knew uh that our legislature would

33
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:46,399
be reconvening Statewide on January 4th

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,360
there was set to be massive bans uh

35
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,599
being implemented across the state so

36
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,920
that was uh this was actually the second

37
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,919
wave but uh most people think that that

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,159
was the first wave because it was when I

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,079
I formed this group and um January we

40
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,240
got Mass occurred um the league of

41
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,478
California cities was on a road show

42
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,878
encouraging all of our local government

43
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:13,039
to ban instead of regulate um they were

44
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:17,199
pushing that erroneous deadline that was

45
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:20,400
passed um in Mera uh which was the March

46
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:24,399
1 deadline and by the time it had been

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,239
repealed we had I believe 240 localities

48
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,120
that had uh banned marijuana so my

49
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,120
background being that I worked on Wall

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,599
Street I was craving this information so

51
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,080
I set up 540 Google email alerts one for

52
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,799
every city and every County so 482

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,599
cities and 58 counties so that I could

54
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,719
see everything going on I still have all

55
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,199
those Google alerts set up and I still

56
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,680
search what is going on you know with

57
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,238
with our cities and counties and with

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,400
they're regulating and right now I

59
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,280
believe about 20% of the state is either

60
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,680
implementing regulations or talking

61
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,560
about regulations and that is up from

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,400
about 10% just just a few months ago so

63
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,000
we are definitely seeing progress and

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,599
now I'd like to give each of our

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,598
speakers a chance to introduce

66
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,919
themselves gami hello everybody um

67
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:15,598
there's a lot of stuff that I can talk

68
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,719
about but I guess uh the one that I'm

69
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,280
going to talk about is uh property in La

70
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,919
property is probably the worst

71
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,280
legislation that has ever been written

72
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,199
to you know for a city in the history of

73
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,400
the world and so but it kept us alive

74
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,199
and that's why you know it's good that

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,599
was the only thing now we're in the

76
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,518
process of working with the city six

77
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:36,560
months ago we gave the city of Los

78
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,560
Angeles an ordinance that was written by

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,319
Mayor Brown which is one of the most

80
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,640
prestigious law firms in Los Angeles to

81
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:46,079
ensure that they have a framework that

82
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:47,919
they can work with that won't be suable

83
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,959
we're working with the city that is our

84
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,559
main um it's different now uh when I

85
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,640
started this 10 years ago we had to beg

86
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,280
to talk to uh elected officials Mr ket's

87
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,318
always welcomed us and was always

88
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,919
wonderful but most of the city council

89
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:04,878
members you know it was like we were

90
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,878
begging them please listen to us things

91
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:10,039
have changed now um the politics have

92
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:12,120
caught up to the science and so

93
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,679
everybody understands that medical

94
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,358
medical marijuana is just that it's

95
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,280
medical and that um also that there's a

96
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:22,240
lot of of to be gained by um tax income

97
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,279
in the city which everybody you know

98
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,960
really likes that I think that's why the

99
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:29,758
politicians are so ready and and and so

100
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,239
able now to help us go along because

101
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,560
they know we're here to stay we're not

102
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,038
going away and that better for them to

103
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,879
regulate us in a correct Manner and and

104
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:42,240
so that they can collect their taxes for

105
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,240
the city and everybody can be happy

106
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:48,478
so um I hope that in March uh we're able

107
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,360
to do something in the city of El to fix

108
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,199
D because it needs to be fixed and so

109
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,280
that we can join the rest of the state

110
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,478
and being regul regulated by Mera and

111
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,638
whatever else comes along and we can all

112
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,639
Step Up in Los Angeles thank you

113
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:08,519
go ahead Paul thanks yummy well I don't

114
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,439
know where to start but I could say I

115
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:14,599
was the author of prop

116
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:17,959
D so that bad introduction but let me

117
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,199
start at the beginning um I was just

118
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,318
having a meeting with uh some folks

119
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,360
about talking about cultivation and they

120
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,080
said so where do you get your marijuana

121
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,120
because I've been involved in this issue

122
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:31,399
very visibly for years I'm like I'm not

123
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,600
a marijuana on a user and they were

124
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:38,000
astonished but now have I ever smoked a

125
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,080
joint in my entire life well I wasn't

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,399
College in the 70s I'm not going to say

127
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:46,079
anything about whether whether I inhaled

128
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,478
or not but but I'm not a marijuana user

129
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,120
I'm involved because I got elected to

130
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,360
the city council 1988 but I was involved

131
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,199
in founding the city of West Hollywood

132
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,919
in

133
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,680
1984 and we did it for all kinds of good

134
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:03,599
reasons and all of it went perfectly and

135
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,439
and except the AIDS crisis hit and it

136
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,520
hit with a Vengeance we are the hardest

137
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:12,959
hit City per per person um in the

138
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,758
country and so I personally as I mean

139
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,439
this is a disease that in West Hollywood

140
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:21,479
mostly hit gaymen um I'm a straight guy

141
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:24,120
I personally knew over 200 people that

142
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:27,918
died of AIDS um and there were many many

143
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,519
more um at one point we had uh over one

144
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:34,038
person in every 10 housing units in the

145
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:35,959
city had HIV or Aids um and in the

146
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:39,120
beginning we had we had no medicine for

147
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:42,478
it um there were the only thing we had

148
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,639
was medical marijuana and it improved

149
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,918
the quality of life and it kept some

150
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,240
people alive longer um it dealt with the

151
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,680
nausea it dealt with the wasting and

152
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
kept people with an appetite um there

153
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,759
were there were so many elements to it

154
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,280
it dealt with the pain um and I have

155
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,840
friends that are alive today because

156
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:05,638
they lasted long enough to as a bridge

157
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,279
um to to get to the stronger drugs

158
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,360
people like Richard Eastman who some of

159
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:13,399
you know um and others are still around

160
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,199
today 30 years later um and so that got

161
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,519
me involved in the issue and I've been

162
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,038
involved from that time that whole 30

163
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:24,318
years and so um when John

164
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:27,519
vasconcelos uh drafted

165
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,120
sb420 um people were really terrified to

166
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,439
be associated with marijuana and the

167
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,598
legisl lure so I was the principal

168
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,199
co-author on the assembly side um but

169
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:37,959
there weren't a lot of other co-authors

170
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,240
I think there might have been one other

171
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,839
person um people ultimately voted for it

172
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,800
it was written in a very compromising

173
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:49,198
way to get passed but it was so vague

174
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,720
that it its regulations caused as many

175
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,478
problems as they solved um ultimately we

176
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,520
tried to correct that with prop D and in

177
00:07:55,478 --> 00:08:00,478
Los Angeles we took so many different

178
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:03,639
approaches every step we took in every

179
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:06,158
direction uh CA caused us to get

180
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,560
hammered legally so no matter what we

181
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:12,079
tried it didn't work uh prop D was the

182
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,360
only thing that stuck but before that we

183
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:19,240
passed things uh that were were more

184
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,158
permissive um and we legally got hit we

185
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,360
actually had a vote at one point to uh

186
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:26,879
to ban marijuana and that passed and

187
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,919
that passed 13 to1 I was the one vote

188
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,360
against it on my birthday and yet we we

189
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:34,120
found that there are too many legal

190
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,839
problems with that so we repealed that

191
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,839
right away also um I only had one

192
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,159
colleague who was an enthusiastic

193
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,959
supporter um I think because of his

194
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,838
presence on the council prop D passed

195
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:48,119
his name was Bill rosendall I don't know

196
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,080
if any of you know him or remember him

197
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,039
wonderful guy um but he was a medical

198
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,240
marijuana user because three years

199
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,639
before he died he was diagnosed with

200
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,079
with fourth stage cancer and was

201
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,600
literally just about about dead I

202
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:04,639
thought he was going to last a couple

203
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,759
weeks um he reacted well to

204
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,639
chemotherapy and he survived all of his

205
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,879
side effects and the pain and lack of

206
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,399
appetite and all kinds of other things

207
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,720
because of medical marijuana it kept him

208
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,159
alive for three years and I think that

209
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,480
made the council see that they had to

210
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:26,000
accept something uh again prop D was

211
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,200
vague partly because we were told it had

212
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,278
to be we were told we couldn't license

213
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,160
um because it was illegal by our City

214
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,919
attorney so we sort of had a list of

215
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:39,439
people that uh we would give a wink and

216
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:41,519
a nod and under prop D they would be

217
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,200
compliant and even then we didn't have a

218
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,039
list of who they all were uh so

219
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,759
sometimes uh we would crack down even on

220
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,159
the people that we were supposed to not

221
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:54,838
crack down on um and our City attorney

222
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:58,480
would go after them um at the same time

223
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,959
uh we had 135 that were semile legit in

224
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
this this

225
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:04,719
unclear way we probably have a thousand

226
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,039
that are illegal that have popped up and

227
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,160
we try to prosecute them and close them

228
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,759
down and for everyone that got closed

229
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:14,600
down another one would pop up so that's

230
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:18,559
been a mess um State legislation I think

231
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,399
will help I think we will uh we will

232
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,559
figure out how to deal with things that

233
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,720
we should be dealing with like

234
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,958
cultivation I mean right now we we we

235
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,920
deal with marijuana by Immaculate

236
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:33,679
Conception but somehow it gets to the

237
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:36,000
dispensaries once it's there it's legal

238
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,000
um if we catch you growing it in LA we

239
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,759
prosecute you if we catch you

240
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,120
transporting it to a dispensary we

241
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:46,319
prosecute you of course this makes great

242
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,480
sense so we are working to try and

243
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,600
correct it it's also a question of how

244
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,560
many dispensaries we're going to have

245
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,000
which ones are going to be legal we

246
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:58,518
think around 65 of the original 135 that

247
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,159
were compliant are still in business um

248
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:04,720
do we Grand B them in uh there's a lot

249
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:07,439
of question about uh Fair distribution

250
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,278
ethnically geographically in the city I

251
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,680
think there's an appetite to fill that

252
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:16,078
all in uh so there's equal access uh

253
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:18,239
across the city um once we we passed

254
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,239
prop 64 which I think is absolutely

255
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,000
inevitable there's going to be much more

256
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,320
demand so I think if we have two few

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,440
dispensaries will have the problem that

258
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,760
my Council has reacted to it's not that

259
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,320
they are anti- marijuana but there were

260
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,679
there were some nuisance factors there

261
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:39,240
are some bad operators um of of

262
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:41,919
facilities and uh council members

263
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,720
responded to constituent complaints well

264
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,039
if we if we have too few dispensaries

265
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,800
we're going to have lines around the

266
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,799
block we're going to have a lot of the

267
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:52,679
complaints that my colleagues complained

268
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:55,479
about um so we we have to at least

269
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,679
provide uh enough dispensaries to meet

270
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,879
the demand so there are a lot of

271
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:03,399
confusing issues La is kind of a mess on

272
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,399
this but I think we will we will clean

273
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,759
this up um before the deadline for

274
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,200
permitting goes into effect hopefully a

275
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,600
lot sooner so we can not arrest people

276
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,320
for no purpose um and we can get this

277
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,560
show on the road and start doing it the

278
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,639
right way I'm not sure my colleagues

279
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:22,919
care that much about the revenue I think

280
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,240
it'll be a nice added bonus um one thing

281
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:26,278
I should say is we thought we were going

282
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,360
to have to put something on the ballot

283
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:32,240
our City attorney is opine that we can

284
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,759
do everything but tax by ordinance so I

285
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,240
think we should just keep our 6% set tax

286
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:39,600
where it is at least for for a while and

287
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,399
just focus on doing this right not put

288
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,120
it on the ballot pass an ordinance that

289
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,120
works and get

290
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,399
going isn't it a breath of fresh air to

291
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,839
hear a regulator admit that there are

292
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:57,000
problems with an ordinance and thank you

293
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,360
Paul uh Janine tell us a little bit

294
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,078
about you thank you uh well first first

295
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,278
of all I'd like to welcome everybody

296
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:05,759
here uh to Long Beach and the second

297
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,000
district uh we are in my district which

298
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:12,078
I have been uh representative for just

299
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,958
about two months um so welcome everyone

300
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:19,399
uh I'm originally from Texas uh and I

301
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:22,799
grew up uh always knowing that marijuana

302
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:25,240
had medicinal purposes my mother used it

303
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,319
and she the first time I did she gave it

304
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,639
to me uh to help with my cramps and said

305
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,600
you go to the doctor and cry or you know

306
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,720
you can do this and it was something

307
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,519
that that was the frame that I always

308
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:43,120
had and so I came uh to the issues of

309
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,799
medical marijuana to the debate about it

310
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,519
with a very open mind even though I'm

311
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:51,479
not an avid user although also college

312
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:54,759
and high school and I'll admit I did

313
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,800
inhale um and so uh when I started

314
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:58,278
running for Council it was uh one of

315
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,519
those issues and in Long Beach and I'll

316
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:03,720
talk about the history of our you know

317
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,240
sorted uh debate about to regulate not

318
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,440
regulate and what to regulate in a

319
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,480
minute uh but I came to the debate uh

320
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,480
and the conversation very openly in

321
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,278
support of it um wasn't going to try to

322
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,120
walk the line that I think other

323
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,639
electeds have tried to walk in the city

324
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,639
because we have a more conservative

325
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,480
background uh because we've kind of been

326
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,720
timid of regulating it uh very openly

327
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,360
being able to say we need to have access

328
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,759
to medicine for all of our residents uh

329
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,159
that doesn't uh hinge on a delivery

330
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,320
system where you're putting people at

331
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,919
risk uh for robbery that doesn't hinge

332
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,680
on other cities uh you know getting

333
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:42,519
their tax revenue and Long Beach missing

334
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:45,078
out but Long Beach uh is definitely uh

335
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,519
moving in the right direction and as a

336
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:49,000
regulator I think it's really important

337
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,320
to start in cities and partner with

338
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,879
folks like you uh because as much as we

339
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,000
can be supportive of an idea or a

340
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,439
Concepts how it works is it's the devil

341
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,240
in the details as we've heard from LA

342
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,440
and other places whenever we try to do

343
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,639
ordinances uh sometimes we have to learn

344
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,160
from those mistakes and so working

345
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,759
closely with you all to talk about what

346
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,078
works what doesn't what's the right

347
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,079
amount of dispensaries to have grow and

348
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,799
everything else and so I'm really happy

349
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,758
to be here with you guys today and to

350
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,078
learn from you all uh to move forward

351
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,199
because I do believe that in November uh

352
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,399
Long Beach has two ballot measures which

353
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:24,599
I'll talk about but mm which is medical

354
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,159
marijuana bringing that back to the city

355
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,800
right now it's banned and then another

356
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,559
initiative that the city council put on

357
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,240
the ballot uh to tax both medical and

358
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,198
recreational at a higher rate than it's

359
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,799
already taxed uh and so I'll talk in

360
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:40,519
detail about both of those as well but

361
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,519
welcome everybody excited to be

362
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:47,159
here thank you Janine Nathan tell us a

363
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:49,360
little bit about your about you my name

364
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:53,078
is Nathan vosberg I'm from the city of

365
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,240
Kinga we are currently the only uh City

366
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:58,359
in Fresno County that has moved forward

367
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,079
with regulation if you look on weed maps

368
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,120
there is a very giant hole in the

369
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:06,719
Central Valley about like this which in

370
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:12,360
my opinion has promoted a very gray and

371
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:15,480
very black market area um you know when

372
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:19,680
the issue came in when the issue came in

373
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:23,199
January and we were asked to make a

374
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:25,479
decision um to me personally I thought

375
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,198
in my mind you know this is something

376
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,399
doing research beforehand that could

377
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,039
help a lot of people and and when I

378
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,078
looked into the audience and our

379
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,759
audience was pretty much at that point

380
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:36,958
in time I think maybe they're the only

381
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:41,000
people that paid attention to the

382
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:44,198
agenda um but they were 100% in in for

383
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,879
this at the time I believe Almost 100%

384
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:48,439
uh our next meeting it wasn't so nice

385
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,879
people found out what we wanted to do

386
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,199
with regulations and we had a big group

387
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,519
of people show up that were not in

388
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:58,879
support of what we're of what we wanted

389
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,600
to do and it was really an interest

390
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,838
interesting thing to try and somewhat

391
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,160
sell our citizens on the

392
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:10,639
idea and we went

393
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:13,798
through quite a few different phases in

394
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,720
in trying to do this uh we fought the

395
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:18,160
medical battle we went back and forth

396
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,120
with our citizens on who supported this

397
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:25,279
for medical use and then we went through

398
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:28,318
you know the security and and what comes

399
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,918
along with bringing facilities uh which

400
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,918
were initially talking about a

401
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,440
dispensary and that's when we had our

402
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,240
first 50 vote which pretty much shocked

403
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,558
everyone in Fresno County because

404
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,079
everyone including our Sheriff was

405
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,200
completely against this kind of idea

406
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,960
kind of shocked the council too we were

407
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,279
kind of like you know interested like

408
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,038
hey we have a group of people in front

409
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:50,960
of us and those people wanted it so we

410
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,798
did it so what I'm here to tell you guys

411
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,640
is is that I want to thank every single

412
00:17:53,798 --> 00:18:00,158
P person in this room for providing us

413
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,600
with the with the data with the ideas

414
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,760
with the research to move forward

415
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:08,038
because without you people this doesn't

416
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:11,400
work like in counsil in

417
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:14,400
government our job is to promote what

418
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,280
the people want and to make compromise

419
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,280
most of the time and finding out how to

420
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,599
compromise in between something where

421
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,079
people are what I'm finding a 50/50

422
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,798
split in our conservative area maybe

423
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:30,480
even 6040 on the other side um

424
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:33,119
California wise it maybe 60 40 7030

425
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,599
towards AUM passing but in a very

426
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,918
conservative belt of the Central Valley

427
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,000
it may be flipped and so trying to

428
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,200
figure out a way

429
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,798
to uh compromise with both sides has

430
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,080
been very interesting and we've been

431
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:51,720
taking the data I've been you know when

432
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:54,119
I joined um Jackie's Facebook group it

433
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,679
was for just that to get the data I

434
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,000
wanted to take the data back to our

435
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,240
Council and say hey this is what other

436
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,720
counties and cities are doing and this

437
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,440
is the information from the people we

438
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,159
have visited um lots of different

439
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,600
dispensaries we've we've visited grow

440
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,919
we've visited uh all kinds of different

441
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:15,359
places to try and figure out like what

442
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,000
is best practice what are the things

443
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,639
that come with this what are the good

444
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,679
actors what are the Bad actors and

445
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,799
everyone in this room probably has had

446
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,240
something to do with uh you know us

447
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:27,359
trying to figure this out and I just

448
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,240
want to really thank everybody because

449
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,719
without that it doesn't it doesn't work

450
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,558
and and I couldn't my people wouldn't

451
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,240
relate to this in Kinga at all if there

452
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:36,839
wasn't other people saying hey this is

453
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,200
what we've done and this is what it's

454
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:43,798
worked and this isn't just um you know

455
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,640
your cliche of potheads and Stoners out

456
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:49,079
there this is your people that are

457
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,799
seeking some kind of help that don't

458
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:53,240
want to go the traditional route or the

459
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:56,079
traditional route isn't working for them

460
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,079
and so um I'd like to thank Susan for

461
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,319
putting this uh together and I'd like to

462
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,000
thank Jack for her Facebook group who

463
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:05,038
has allowed um you know our city and

464
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,079
other cities like us and so what I'm

465
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,038
going to talk about today is that

466
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:11,839
Journey that we went on and the

467
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:15,480
different perils that we've went through

468
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:17,519
trying to move forward to provide

469
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,759
opportunity that's what this is this is

470
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,440
opportunity because if you think that 50

471
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,839
that we're going to do something for 50%

472
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,159
of the people in my place that that

473
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,000
support medical and the other 50% of the

474
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,559
people who don't believe in it well that

475
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,279
just doesn't work work I mean that's

476
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:33,519
what we found we found that that doesn't

477
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:37,279
work because you have a divide in people

478
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:39,798
you need to find a topic or a narrative

479
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,599
that fits everyone and we found that

480
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:45,319
jobs and economy fit everyone's

481
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,918
narrative now I want to show you guys

482
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:50,038
something I have I have this green

483
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,720
wristband on right here this green

484
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,919
wristband is in support of the thing

485
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,798
that we couldn't do in Kinga which was

486
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,960
we couldn't pass a dispensary so we put

487
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:01,558
it on the ballot so the ballots coming

488
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,679
up and this is my support right here for

489
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:07,440
that ballot measure to say that I

490
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,840
support a dispensary in Kinga however we

491
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,960
had to compromise we had to say we

492
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,038
listen to our people and our people are

493
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,679
citing security concerns and all kinds

494
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:18,798
of things um you know to do with

495
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,038
dispensaries and I feel really bad that

496
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,720
we couldn't get that moved forward but I

497
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,720
do feel confident that our people will

498
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,278
come around and say hey you know what

499
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,759

500
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:31,798

501
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:33,960

people that did not care one way or

520

common uh commitment to doing the right

529
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,559
thing for people I'm a County Supervisor

530

to that in the same Community I worked

535
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,480
for state government for about 25 years

536
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,120
before I retired in 2003 my jobs in

537
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,640
state government were five years with

538
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:56,399
the legislative analyst office

539
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,600
nonpartisan fiscal adviser and 20 years

540
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,919
working for the Department of

541
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,079
Corrections and the Department of the

542
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:04,159
Youth Authority in Corrections in the

543
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:06,480
mid 80s my role was to build new prisons

544
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,520
and realized we can't build enough if

545
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,919
we're going to continue on the

546
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:14,798
trajectory that we've been on Yolo

547
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:17,360
County is about 210,000 people it's 1,00

548
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,119
square miles about 85% of that is Farm

549
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,918
country there's a hundred-year

550
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:24,798
partnership between the University of

551
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:27,038
California Davis and Growers Farmers

552
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,000
they their the wave of a waves of

553
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,240
Agriculture have have uh have have been

554
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,119
really amazing there's innovation in

555
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,480
farm country there's something that I

556
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:38,719
think of as the square tomato the square

557
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,400
tomato is this unique partnership

558
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,278
between genetic manipulation and

559
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,480
Engineering so that we can produce

560
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:48,919
tomatoes that have a longer lifespan a

561
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,000
longer shelf life harder on the outside

562
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:53,679
and still juicy and very nutritious on

563
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,759
the inside so we can Harvest them and

564
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,000
have them shipped to a place where they

565
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:01,119
can be processed and we created at the

566
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,720
same time time harvesting equipment that

567
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:06,399
could handle that equ that those those

568
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,880
products and get them to to Market and

569
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,960
as a result of that our county is the is

570
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,640
the world's leading producer of

571
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,440
processing Tomatoes it makes no sense in

572
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,038
the world that we don't acknowledge the

573
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,558
agricultural enterprise that cannabis

574
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:24,759
brings and Yolo County is perfectly

575
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:26,798
situated to do that I'm excited about

576
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:29,720
the the changes that we see a foot

577
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:32,480
because we can see better research on

578
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,440
the effect effecacy efficacy of

579
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,200
medicinal uses of cannabis for specific

580
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,440
maladies that the human uh suffers from

581
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,798
and University of California Davis is

582
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,360
the home of a medical school life

583
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:48,639
sciences uh Powerhouse as well as a

584
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,839
veterinary school and and just an

585
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,840
amazing an amazing conglomeration of

586
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,759
Partnerships with with the agricultural

587
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:58,519
Community Yolo County when we were faced

588
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:01,158
with the the this this thread of a March

589
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:03,319
3rd deadline we tried to we struggled to

590
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:05,278
try to find a way to balance the

591
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:07,158
interest this March 3rd deadline that

592
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,558
you're either going to have to regulate

593
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:11,600
or do some other uh ban and it the

594
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:13,440
easiest thing to do in the world was to

595
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,199
Simply fall back and say no we're not

596
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,519
going to do any of that that didn't make

597
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,519
sense for our County we we had we think

598
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:24,759
we have 800 to a th000 growers in our

599
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:27,558
County currently 210,000 people 800 to

600
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,960
th000 Growers that's a pretty big number

601
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:32,119
we know that in the fields and Hills

602
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,120
that we already have cultivators so

603
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:36,479
cultivation is a thing that we wanted to

604
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:38,558
really look hard at we found a way to

605
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,038
balance uh I think an ordinance we

606
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:43,798
adopted it in February it's an interim

607
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,839
ordinance we'll be considering uh some

608
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,720
some tweaks here in the first week in

609
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:51,119
October and we're looking at a December

610
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,000
adoption of a final ordinance that's

611
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:56,839
based on what we started with and lots

612
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,079
of input from community members uh we

613
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:01,199
think that probably 800 to th000 of

614
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:03,599
those Growers out there we figure about

615
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,000
20% of them will want to become want to

616
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,158
come out of the Shadows who want to

617
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,960
become legitimate operators and we

618
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,000
already seeing I mentioned that we had

619
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,278
about 11 the other day well I had a

620
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,278
conversation with our a commissioner uh

621
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:18,720
last night or this and this morning and

622
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:21,839
we now have 53 uh uh Growers that are in

623
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,278
the process of becoming fully permitted

624
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,480
I'm I'm looking forward to sharing with

625
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,558
you some of the experiences that we've

626
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,599
had uh and some of the some of the

627
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:31,798
challenges that we're continuing to face

628
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,359
but I I will I will tell you that if you

629

633
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:47,759
people who have endorsed amama uh and

634
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,798

635
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,759
me if I would endorse it I said well of

636
