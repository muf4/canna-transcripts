1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,190
so why don't we start with High Times

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,839
thinks that the the retail game is where

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,410
it's at and they're making a big pivot

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,289
so who wants to start with that one yeah

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,480
I can start it's I told the I think I

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:17,698
said this to Tom the other day I was

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,910
like everybody wants to do retail until

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:28,019
they get into retail it sounds fun it

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,839
looks you know glamorous but it's you

10
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,219
know I think High Times is import

11
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,049
awakening when they realize that the

12
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,570
amount of money they're there is it

13
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:39,179
retail is horrible if you know unless

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,950
you're gonna try to cut corners and try

15
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,988
to have a certain things here and there

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,429
which I'm not gonna lie of third of

17
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:47,189
retailers are doing that you know

18
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,869
they're not doing things that exactly

19
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:52,530
the way that they have been supposed to

20
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:55,738
so you know a and which shocked me

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,989
because there's been a few quite a few

22
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:01,979
retailers that have already been busted

23
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:04,109
by the BCC legal ones doing things that

24
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,879
they're not supposed to I mean I know of

25
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:08,909
one that got caught with a hundred

26
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,589
pounds of illicit cannabis selling it

27
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,990
out of the jar from underneath the

28
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,700
register underneath the counter and they

29
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:17,819
have their license and nothing's

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,890
nothing's done so you know that's

31
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,798
another disheartening fact you know off

32
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,150
subject but yeah I think High Times is

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,520
in for a rude awakening when they

34
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,259
realize that the retail business is not

35
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,629
all it was meant to be and that they're

36
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,879
not going to be able to get the

37
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:35,250
evaluation that they want from retail to

38
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,459
sell it or what they eventually plan on

39
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,200
doing well wait a second let's back up a

40
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,089
second where they just slap where they

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,640
just let go or there was a slap on the

42
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,399
wrist is that stung

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,649
that's not enforcement no it's not

44
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,509
enforcement at all and you know the BCC

45
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,820
has always said oh well II only enforced

46
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,409
and the DCR we only own of course

47
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,868
against legal operators cuz that's

48
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,280
that's that's what we can do that's what

49
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:01,319
we're allowed to do we're not allowed to

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,329
enforce against illegal but they're not

51
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,809
enforcing against legal ones either that

52
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:12,348
are breaking the laws so and when you do

53
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,830
that now you're creating a completely

54
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:15,810
missed you

55
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,550
market because now you have legal

56
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,490
operators that are doing illegal stuff

57
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,890
to cut corners isn't quick isn't cushy

58
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,570
punch back to business as usual and

59
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:26,639
because she punches back the business

60
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:29,310
hey you know I mean they got caught with

61
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:32,399
a completely illegal facility running to

62
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,170
location and again I know are you guys

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,200
selling cushy punch in your shop

64
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:39,780
I am NOT but I have been friends with

65
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,250
the owner and I met him I met up with

66
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,770
him the other day and I asked him he

67
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,599
said oh yeah we're gonna be back online

68
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,900
so I don't think they actually have

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,090
products back out there yet but you know

70
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,760
it all it is is the brand gets caught

71
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,189
they find another licensee they make a

72
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,530
licensing agreement for the name and

73
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:01,259
next thing you know that brand is back

74
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,189
online with a new license so you know

75
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:08,579
and again I I love the guy very nice guy

76
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:11,579
family guy but you know when when people

77
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,170
are doing things like this and he's not

78
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,969
the worst you know the other retailers

79
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,099
selling you know literally they

80
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:20,489
confiscated a hundred pounds from his

81
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:24,150
facility and I know of another incident

82
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:26,310
where the idiot manager started running

83
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:30,870
down the back alley with like 20 pounds

84
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:33,030
and the bcc agents tackled him okay I

85
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,819
mean and they're still operating it

86
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,219
makes no sense and I'm over here worried

87
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,930
about taxes and this and that and I'm

88
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,370
getting you know if I'm late I'll get a

89
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,180
threat letter that I'm gonna even lose

90
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,209
my license

91
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,099
but then the person who completely does

92
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,560
something illegal and gets caught

93
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:53,129
red-handed

94
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,979
nothing so it just a lot of things just

95
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:59,310
don't make sense to me you know and and

96
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,899
if you're not going to enforce in areas

97
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,269
where you have complete control to

98
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,360
indoors let alone the ones that you

99
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:09,060
don't well again you know you're setting

100
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,650
us up for failure and you're rewarding

101
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,069
the people that are doing illegal stuff

102
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,379
to continue doing illegal stuff back to

103
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,620
the question at hand about high times I

104
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:22,709
don't know if anyone else is as bored as

105
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:26,699
I am but I actually pulled up the SEC

106
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:28,789
filing on to look at what assets were

107
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,860
included

108
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:35,430
purchased so you've got to kind of

109
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,920
unwind it free harvest before harvest

110
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:41,879
entered the California picture it was

111
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,220
have a heart out of Seattle that was on

112
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:49,259
you know getting some of the retail

113
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:53,400
permits in not so coveted jurisdictions

114
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:55,620
let's say so harvest purchased have a

115
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:59,159
hearts dispensaries and then they were

116
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,610
also in the process of getting some of

117
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,550
their own licenses so I unpacked just

118
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,410
what it is that High Times allegedly

119
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,590
purchased and I'm saying allegedly

120
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:14,730
because you still need a stock to go

121
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:17,219
public and on all of these different

122
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,250
jurisdictions to sign off on this before

123
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,600
this deal could ever go through so

124
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,990
minimum I would say you're looking at a

125
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,410
year before you know any dots would be

126
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,000
the t's would be crossed and and eyes

127
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:35,070
would be dotted before this would be

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,230
completed so we've got a harvest in Palm

129
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,370
Springs and if you're familiar with the

130
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,319
Palm Springs market

131
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,860
Palm Springs is one of two jurisdictions

132
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,230
in the entire state that have an open

133
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,680
process for retail the other being

134
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:51,540
Lompoc so if you're interested in

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,129
getting a retail permit those are the

136
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,430
two jurisdictions that if you can find

137
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:58,259
property that qualify you can get you

138
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,930
pretty much can get a retail permit

139
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:03,240
there so you've got a very overcrowded

140
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,509
market in Palm Springs that's one of

141
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,180
them

142
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:09,269
you've got another one in harvest of

143
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,129
Venice which if my memory serves me

144
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:14,250
correctly I believe Venice is only a

145
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:17,519
medical market which is a really tough

146
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:21,180
way to compete these days we've got

147
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:23,579
harvest of Merced you've got harvest of

148
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,079
Riverside and I don't think that one is

149
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,060
opened yet you've got harvest of

150
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,339
Handford which isn't open yet you've got

151
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,879
harvest of blithe which is definitely

152
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:38,399
not open yet and then you've got two

153
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:41,279
very expensive dispensary permits in San

154
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,399
Francisco you've got another one in San

155
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:49,969
Bernadino which I don't believe is open

156
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:52,949
and to in Auckland one in Kalinga and

157
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:56,690
the final one being in Santa Cruz and

158
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:59,399
Santa Cruz only allows you to sell off

159
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:03,930
20% of the business so what they sold

160
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:07,709
was their 20 percent stake in or no

161
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:13,759
actually I think it's only 10% so you've

162
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:16,289
got a lot of less you know desirable

163
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,209
areas to operate you know I know that

164
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:22,919
the Kalinga store is if it's still open

165
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:26,909
is doing about a thousand dollars a day

166
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:29,299
so um these are the types of assets I

167
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:33,450
want everyone to be aware of that

168
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:36,389
harvest unload potentially unloaded on

169
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:38,399
to high times high time still has to go

170
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:43,259
public and still has to you know take

171
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:45,839
possession of these and in the midst of

172
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:50,639
a pandemic when everybody is shifting

173
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:53,549
from retail to curbside or delivery you

174
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,439
know those business models absolutely do

175
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,530
not make sense in either Oakland or San

176
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:01,050
Francisco and maybe they could make

177
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:04,589
sense if you're going to turn all of

178
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:07,439
those assets into trying to become a

179
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:09,179
statewide delivery brand is the only

180
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:13,019
thing that I could think that they would

181
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:16,530
attempt to do but that would all depend

182
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:19,139
on how expensive those San Francisco and

183
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,969
Oakland properties really are and how

184
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,969
much those are bleeding them dry until

185
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:26,250
they actually are up and running and up

186
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,960
and running in a post pandemic world

187
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,168
where we're not wearing masks and were

188
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:35,279
you know congregating again and so this

189
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:37,379
to me should be viewed as a Hail Mary by

190
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:42,179
both harvest who's looking to unload

191
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:44,429
their less desirable assets and a Hail

192
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,229
Mary by high times hoping that this will

193
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:48,838
help them go public and that's all this

194
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,340
is and nothing more and just quickly a

195
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,950
show of hands

196
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:58,290
the panelists who here is getting in on

197
00:08:52,950 --> 00:09:02,629
the high times reggae offering getting

198
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:04,889
in while the goings hot anybody email

199
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:06,629
but you know something funny about high

200
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:08,159
times in that whole situation first of

201
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,710
all it's just whole thing screams Hard

202
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:14,600
Rock Cafe to me and like this idea of

203
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:17,730
just these super like commercial just

204
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,639
wonky look in places that have like

205
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:24,990
cheech's pipe in a glass display or

206
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,699
something but bloody high time story so

207
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,889
you know flow kana we launched this

208
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,750
dirty money campaign on a Monday and we

209
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:32,490
did an Instagram post it was basically

210
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,139
like encouraging people to contact the

211
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,759
representative and you know we don't

212
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:37,409
want to have to handle cash great

213
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,750
actually posted it some dude from High

214
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:41,549
Times who works there commented and was

215
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,250
like all his comment says was your

216
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:46,429
lobbying wrong or that's not how you do

217
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:49,230
it or something like that and I was like

218
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:50,429
okay so we responded and we were like

219
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,810
you know what do you mean we think this

220
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:53,339
is an issue people would care about

221
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:55,019
especially since you just purchased 13

222
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,850
dispensaries and this is about not

223
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,860
having to handle cash in a dispensary

224
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,680
and they responded that of course they

225
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,350
care and that they invented grassroots

226
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:07,409
lobbying so in case folks didn't know

227
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,420
that out there high time invented

228
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:10,379
grassroots lobbying which actually isn't

229
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:14,339
even a thing

230
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:15,929
but they invented it and so you know

231
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,480
they obviously really know what they're

232
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:20,489
doing and they've got a great team I did

233
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:28,159
just read that stormy Simon is no longer

234
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:32,310
the CEO step down she lasted four months

235
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:34,469
yeah yeah now I I had conversations with

236
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:36,869
stormy where I told her to get out I

237
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,690
said you do because you know where it

238
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,090
started was when I got the emails and

239
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,430
you know the one from today is coming

240
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:47,220
you know who sent it high times investor

241
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:49,379
who sent it Adam Levin and then there

242
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,450
was one that had Stormy's name on it and

243
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:53,429
I immediately emailed her and said don't

244
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:57,300
let them put your name I was like and

245
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:59,129
then I was like don't you do not a

246
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:03,449
couple years from now once you be

247
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:04,049
associated with duping little old ladies

248
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,990
who

249
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:08,609
invested in high times you do not want

250
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,620
your name associated with that and then

251
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,240
we had a long phone call and uh you know

252
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,690
I've been trading emails I'm gonna try

253
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,720
to get her on to do a webcast but just

254
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,820
and being clear for anybody who's

255
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,430
watching cuz I'm gonna cut this is the

256
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,070
high time segment so people don't have

257
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:29,399
to wait till the end the people who

258
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:32,670
currently run high times are a bunch of

259
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,980
finance douchebags who have nothing to

260
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:37,740
do with the grass roots history of high

261
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:44,039
times from the sick from the 70s and 80s

262
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:49,079
and any master you know any good grower

263
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:51,449
does not read high times today ok so

264
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,909
just everybody who is thinking of

265
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,890
investing in high times or who thinks oh

266
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:59,819
my god that'd be amazing to go to a high

267
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:02,789
times dispensary so we have a couple

268
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,370
brands on here amanda is Flo kana going

269
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:08,939
to rush to supply product to high times

270
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,528
retail Shannon is Fiddler's greens is

271
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,420
that gonna be the first phone call you

272
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:14,578
make when they take over those retail

273
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:16,860
operations and shame on you

274
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:21,028
we'll see I blame high times in a lot of

275
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,919
ways for bringing this weird idea of

276
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:24,929
what quality is to the marketplace and

277
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,778
that's really been hard for sun-grown

278
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:29,789
because when I was growing up in Chicago

279
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:32,309
and looking at High Times Magazine they

280
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:33,899
had be centerfolds of buds that are

281
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:37,199
supposed to be like the highest-quality

282
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,909
buds like these were the buds and they

283
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,250
were all indoor and they were all grown

284
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:42,809
like this far from the light and none of

285
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,399
them really looked I always would come

286
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:46,588
compare it to like the Playboy

287
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,629
centerfold or like you grow up thinking

288
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:49,980
that that's what like the ideal woman

289
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:51,149
looks like and then you get out in the

290
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,820
world and you realize that was all

291
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:55,649
bullshit I kind of feel like that's what

292
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,750
high times did they set it up for people

293
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:01,139
consumers to think that quality meant

294
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:03,690
orange hairs and tight nugs well and

295
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:06,929
that's not true so then I make corn hub

296
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:09,360
of cannabis no no I kept Kevin I have a

297
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:11,489
video clip of that I'll play in the end

298
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,419
the on-demand version Kevin Joe jury

299
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:17,680
said at best which was the article on

300
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:20,528
the left side of the page which

301
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:23,079
is that hydro bud its sole purpose was

302
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:27,909
to sell the product on the right side of

303
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:30,879
the page which was an HP s light or

304
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:32,169
whatever it was what you have is you

305
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,820
have information that's used as

306
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:36,819
basically marketing it's kind of like

307
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,778
reading old high times because I haven't

308
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,240
read this shit in years it's like

309
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:42,669
reading high times and every article was

310
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,009
basically to sell the material on the

311
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:46,958
next page so they're not giving you any

312
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:51,220
information that giving you a marketing

313
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:53,949
pitch wrapped around some photos yeah

314
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,139
absolutely and and but unfortunately the

315
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,149
impact that it had on the consumer

316
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:01,269
marketplace was that all these years

317
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:03,278
later in doors being sold for $65 an

318
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:05,919
eighth and Sun grown is lucky to get 40

319
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,360
and I do think that High Times played a

320
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,099
huge role in that like I don't think

321
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,839
they'll ever take responsibility for it

322
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,899
but I think they played a huge role in

323
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:16,240
really leading the consumer or on us

324
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:20,379
astray when it comes to knowing what a

325
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,690
quality cannabis product is yeah and

326
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:26,679
it's a double-edged sword right because

327
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:29,830
for I grew up in Texas and a lot of my

328
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:32,349
first exposure to cannabis was you know

329
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,900
High Times magazines that we were able

330
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,610
to look out and see so it brought it to

331
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,708
people who weren't in Northern

332
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,909
California weren't part of the community

333
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:44,528
but like Amanda said it was also

334
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:47,049
misbranding and misrepresenting it was

335
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:50,200
you know selling McDonald's hamburgers

336
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:54,099
like it was filet mignon and so we've

337
00:14:50,200 --> 00:15:00,100
got to undo that at this point I like

338
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:02,920
that analogy to be rushing to you do

339
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,778
business with high kinds of retail shops

340
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:11,439
that's not really in line with our

341
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:14,439
brands and our mission got it okay have

342
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,770
we beaten high times sufficient to

343
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,770
appear

344
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,958
okay
