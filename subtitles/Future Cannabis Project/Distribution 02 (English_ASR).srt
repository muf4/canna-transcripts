1
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:21,429
and really by focusing on grading you

2
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:23,049
you can take something that was garbage

3
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:25,960
that farmers used to sit on and turn

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,580
into extract and you take bees and like

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,469
turn to some beautiful live resin and

6
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:30,820
but it's not only work of the farmers

7
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:33,429
but making sure that they gain the most

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,619
of the dollar by walking with them and

9
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:37,058
working with other partners so them

10
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,189
approached him individually it's what I

11
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:41,289
was greedy and making sure like the

12
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:43,929
farmers also helped plan for what the

13
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:46,509
future is what strains to grow what to

14
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:48,128
focus on and really we focus on being

15
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:56,378
that partner and helping them navigate

16
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:57,878
this as us being farmers ourselves boy

17
00:00:56,378 --> 00:00:59,768
there's a lot of good information up

18
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:01,750
here right now my head just spin and

19
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:04,629
there's so much to say first I'll forgot

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,599
seed to seed to soul that's my cannabis

21
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:10,210
license a name and then soil king and

22
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,859
everything else goes under that and you

23
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:13,959
know what what is going on currently

24
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:16,569
under seed to soul we do the pre-rolls

25
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:20,709
we do a like I said array of different

26
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:22,449
options and try to help other even

27
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:24,968
manufacturers you know a lot of like

28
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,159
like diesel for instance for them they

29
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:29,859
they make their product take it over to

30
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,840
us we have to we because we're a distro

31
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:33,340
we can go ahead and test it we can get

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,020
the results for it we can bring it back

33
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,789
and we we sticker it and package

34
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:38,978
everything and send it out to their

35
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:41,079
distro so it's a service from a distro

36
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:42,728
to a distro from a manufacturer there's

37
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:45,519
a lot of different things like like that

38
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:47,709
like fields extracts and tur pogs I have

39
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,170
a beautiful ice water hash room so we're

40
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:52,179
creating all the washing washing all

41
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,739
them flavors man you walk in my facility

42
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,630
it's it's like off the hook like it's

43
00:01:53,739 --> 00:02:00,489
just like it's like a candy store and so

44
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:02,289
with that also you know we do we fill

45
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:04,000
vape pens there we do everything we

46
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,429
don't do the pho blasting because I'm a

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,409
type six but that product is then sit

48
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:10,509
over four packs sent over for packaging

49
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:14,409
and then sent out to code distributors

50
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:17,169
or just or through my own distribution

51
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:19,120
channels however it ends up you know I

52
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:21,159
think important the most important thing

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,780
with soil king and everything we've been

54
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:25,598
I've been around for a while minute in

55
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,848
this industry this is my passion you

56
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,139
know I mean the first time I was ever in

57
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:31,209
handcuffs was 11 year

58
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:34,269
old growing pot in a pine tree in my

59
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,040
backyard so I you know I'm here like I

60
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,620
love this this is me and it's not just

61
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,719
cannabis it's you know like Casey says

62
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,090
grown vegetables everything everything

63
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:47,020
that grows for me is like tremendous

64
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:49,240
value so with us with soil King in the

65
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,890
market I have soil King production TV

66
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,350
for those of you that know and marketing

67
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:55,659
company and with that my mission is to

68
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,669
grow together changing the world one

69
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:01,599
plant at a time is my mission statement

70
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:03,069
but more so is us growing together and

71
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,019
we're missing that element when you're a

72
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:08,319
farmer you're a farmer you come to me

73
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:11,200
it's just as important for me to show my

74
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,030
brand and me tell your story like I vet

75
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,280
my farmers like there's farmers that

76
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,469
come out of them all over the place and

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,969
say hey I got I got the I got the you

78
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:20,530
hear it all the time the baddest weed on

79
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:22,659
the planet right you hear that all the

80
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,949
time and here it is and I'm like well

81
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,319
what's your story I could care less

82
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:27,969
about your your weed right now like I

83
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,219
really want to know who you are what you

84
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,229
do why you do it how long you been do it

85
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:33,879
what's your passion do you do charity

86
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:35,949
are you community those are important

87
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,659
things to vet a farmer and then I take

88
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,039
that farm and I like it I'm like we're

89
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:40,120
gonna market you and we're gonna take

90
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,889
you with us and we're going to do this

91
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,989
as team and we're gonna take it all

92
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:46,208
through the channels I mean it sounds

93
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,909
easy it's really not distribution model

94
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:51,370
and the retail sector is you know it's a

95
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:53,319
it's very difficult when we when were

96
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:57,489
when we're promoting outdoor sun-grown

97
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:59,799
products it's difficult let's just say

98
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:01,539
that it's a it's challenging there's no

99
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,340
doubt about it it's rewarding when you

100
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:04,750
tell that story and you make believers

101
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,180
but we're up against a brick wall that

102
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:10,569
we got smashed down and we can't do it

103
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:13,659
alone we have to do it together as a

104
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:18,488
community I walked into this event today

105
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:21,159
and started crying because Casey knows a

106
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:24,609
few you out there know we used to do

107
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,200
this together this was and I walked up

108
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,080
here and I haven't had this feeling in

109
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:33,849
two years until I step ground out here

110
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:37,089
right and and it's everything and it's

111
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,669
unity and it's community and that's the

112
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:43,060
message we need to transpire develop

113
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:45,069
create story tell all the way

114
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,290
down through California you know and

115
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:48,730
that's changing the world one plan at a

116
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,129
time getting that message out and I

117
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,980
can't do it for you and I can't do it

118
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:57,189
without you so as a cultivator I don't

119
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,740
want to suppress you I need your voice I

120
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:03,579
need you to hear I need them I need the

121
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,980
people to hear your story because I am

122
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:08,529
not producing your cannabis you're

123
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,780
producing your cannabis I'm just taking

124
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:14,168
your cannabis down the channels and the

125
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:16,000
trust and believe of my consumers are

126
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:19,269
trusting that I'm going to bring a

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,850
superior product or the story I mean and

128
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:24,459
and that's what it's about for me it's

129
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,439
it's always held before wealth you know

130
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:27,819
I'd say health before wealth incomes

131
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:30,069
wealth but we haven't seen that lately

132
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:32,349
it's it's all health health health poor

133
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:35,829
poor poor spend spend spend bleed bleed

134
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:38,050
bleed right so I mean that's that's what

135
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:40,329
it is I mean for me it's like thank you

136
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:44,710
for being here you know listening to you

137
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:48,819
know me gobble we're super stoked you

138
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:50,949
came out thank you and I know like

139
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:52,599
people always say that they're above the

140
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:59,379
best but in Nevada County it's actually

141
00:05:52,600 --> 00:06:00,610
true okay so one of the things one of

142
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:03,189
the questions that I have about

143
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:06,580
distribution it's like you know it's

144
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:09,279
mandated by our state statutes and

145
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:12,519
regulations it's something that's not

146
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,869
mandated in other legalized States but

147
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,668
it has this potential to be really

148
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,949
awesome and be really awesome for

149
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:20,439
farmers so can you guys give us you some

150
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:22,599
of your opinions or your perspective on

151
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:25,029
how distribution and the distribution

152
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,970
component itself it's something that can

153
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:29,978
be helpful for farmers or manufacturers

154
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,990
isn't but any supplier like anybody

155
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:36,219
that's applying product to the market

156
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:38,019
like why does your distribution how

157
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:43,060
could it be utilized in a positive way

158
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:46,209
in California yeah I see distribution as

159
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,918
kind of the the front door if you will

160
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:50,049
of sales you know we've got access to

161
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,788
what's happening out there on the retail

162
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,470
side of the market on the Southern

163
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:55,509
California side of the market if you

164
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,360
will and it's very different cultures in

165
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:57,918
the north and the south

166
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,080
as we all know that especially when it

167
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,389
comes to cultivation and many other

168
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,810
things but you know distribution it's a

169
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:07,639
bridge so you know while we're working

170
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,949
we're we're helping educate farmers

171
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,478
what's happening out there on the supply

172
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:14,750
chain on the on the sales end whether

173
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:16,639
it's you know strain trends and these

174
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,649
fresh frozen trends in different ways

175
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,509
that they can fit into the supply chain

176
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:23,060
whether it's hooking up with a brand or

177
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:25,729
a another distributor or growing for

178
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,069
extraction for oils so creating that

179
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:30,288
bridge right there and educating you

180
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:32,120
know all of this constituents and all of

181
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:32,839
the stakeholders in the supply chain as

182
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,269
we go

183
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,859
everyone's figuring it out no one has it

184
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:40,218
figured out and if they tell you they're

185
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,860
due they're lying because I work with so

186
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:44,779
many so many industry people and and

187
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,669
licensees and everyone will have a

188
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:48,888
different opinion about the same subject

189
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:51,258
the same regulation its interpreted in

190
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:53,028
many ways so it's a very much a

191
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:55,370
cooperative space right now and

192
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:57,079
educating each other and at the same

193
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,439
time I think if the distributor's

194
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:02,448
responsibility to educate the consumers

195
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,639
you know I I heard what you said about

196
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:06,819
the Sun grown cannabis and and how

197
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,340
that's not necessarily valued in a way

198
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:12,468
that indoor is per se so you know and

199
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:13,668
then distillate is not valued in the

200
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:16,278
same way that a full-spectrum

201
00:08:13,668 --> 00:08:18,500
cannabinoid profile oil is so as a

202
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:20,389
distributor of that like middle piece

203
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,949
and the supply chain you know with

204
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:23,900
branding and marketing and the brands

205
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:25,990
that we release and the farms that we

206
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:29,388
are supporting and marketing out there

207
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,829
educating the consumers on why there's a

208
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:33,219
value add for sun-grown

209
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:36,379
why you know clean green certified

210
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:38,360
biodynamic B Corp veganic you know all

211
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:40,370
of these sustainability certifications

212
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,070
are the same trends as Whole Foods and

213
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,990
an organic food and Fairtrade and you

214
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,899
know the the consumer conscious consumer

215
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,899
base in California is quite large and I

216
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,208
do think that globally people are waking

217
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:56,028
up to that trend of sustainability and

218
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:58,939
whole body wellness if you will so I

219
00:08:56,028 --> 00:09:02,120
hope that as distributors you know are

220
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,399
in the space they really play that role

221
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,490
in educating not only the farmers and

222
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,799
the manufacturers but also the consumers

223
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,289
so that they can be they can learn

224
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,838
why to value the pioneer industries why

225
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:16,368
devalue sun-grown and not these

226
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,769
ridiculous gigantic you know companies

227
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:21,290
that are basically just bleeding the

228
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:25,639
earth of even more resources so I hope

229
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:27,889
we can support in that way so I think

230
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:30,678
for distribution it's about finding the

231
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:32,568
market for the support for the supplier

232
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:34,159
and then it's putting everything the

233
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:35,988
buckets so what I mean by find the

234
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,850
market I feel like we don't educate we

235
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:39,559
can't educate the market ourselves you

236
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,569
can show them why its value but you'll

237
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:42,948
find the value and it's hard to find and

238
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:44,149
that's what this is a difficult fund the

239
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:46,099
people to actually look for some girl

240
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:48,198
it's just how do you identify them ahead

241
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,028
you capture them and really the

242
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:51,948
retailer's some retails focus them like

243
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:55,399
soul out of Sebastopol

244
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:57,258
but like others like don't and so it's

245
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,149
kind of finding the market and like as

246
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:01,039
as a retail and I think folk Anna's done

247
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:02,749
a good job a few other guys creating the

248
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,988
value there like getting them out of

249
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:07,909
space market space on in the retail and

250
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:11,199
then tell that story and I think that's

251
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:14,088
extremely important like I think yeah

252
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:15,349
it's a it's by the market and then the

253
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:17,149
buckets is like when you work with the

254
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,920
former I think it's just making sure

255
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,688
everything's used and then everything

256
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,769
can it goes to where it is I keep going

257
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:26,480
back that but I think it's extremely

258
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:28,068
important because really we lot of

259
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,389
farmers have been stirring along and a

260
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:31,248
lot of farmers have me given the value

261
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:32,539
that they're worth and it's because

262
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:34,339
distributors haven't be able to find the

263
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:36,230
market but you have CL artistry we're

264
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:37,999
just going at lower pricing some

265
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,220
distributors doing directed direct

266
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:41,480
direct consumer they're trying to figure

267
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,100
out like how do we fight this whole

268
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:48,159
pricing issue that the black markets

269
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:50,178
beating us at and the market it's hard

270
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,558
struggling it's hard and that's why I

271
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:54,558
was struggling but it's fine the market

272
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:56,298
I think that's that's the big task that

273
00:10:54,558 --> 00:10:58,629
history we can help solve for every

274
00:10:56,298 --> 00:10:58,629
farmer

275
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:10,299
just remind everybody of the question

276
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,460
I'm asking is how can distributors help

277
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:14,859
farmers be successful or manufacturers

278
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,610
but how can distress help suppliers be

279
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:23,528
successful

280
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:25,899
I mean I'm gonna say it there's not a

281
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:27,129
lot of integrity left in our industry at

282
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,949
this point especially on the

283
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:31,570
distribution model I mean it's true

284
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,028
we're sitting up against some good

285
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,830
people right here but you know working

286
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:39,149
with a lot of distributors here you know

287
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:41,800
as a cultivator I'm a cultivator right I

288
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:44,500
also believe that I have one of the best

289
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:47,859
distribution contracts because I'm fair

290
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,929
like we we write things that my we write

291
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,730
things that that I know you want to see

292
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:53,229
as a cultivator and then I want to see

293
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:57,250
right because we're building a community

294
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:59,019
in a relationship for a long time you

295
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,028
know I want if I'm gonna put marketing

296
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,679
dollars into you I want to put marketing

297
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:04,389
dollars in you in five years I don't

298
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,708
want to build you up and then you run to

299
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:07,958
the next guy that's not what it's about

300
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:10,059
it's about us building together and not

301
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,859
saying that you can't share with other

302
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:15,309
distributors because I think the biggest

303
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:18,009
mistake in our industry is is signing a

304
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:19,479
contract that is exclusivity to it I

305
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:21,309
think that's the biggest mistake as a

306
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,409
cultivator you could possibly make and

307
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:28,449
as a small brand supporter I want 50

308
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:30,519
pounds of this I want I want your office

309
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,500
that's 20 pounds of this you know

310
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,360
whatever you got in flavors I don't want

311
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,089
I don't need a hundred pounds I don't

312
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,919
plan on telling you I want you to grow

313
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,140
this I don't need you know six months

314
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:43,689
worth of supply of just one flavor even

315
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:46,028
though the retail is asking for that and

316
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,550
all the other distributors is pushing a

317
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:50,620
lot of that for me I want your unique

318
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:51,969
for Vera dolls of your varieties and I

319
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,159
want your neat unique cultivate

320
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,320
cultivars and I want to be able to

321
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,778
package them up and show that hole down

322
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,520
to you know that whole thing down to you

323
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:03,309
know all at the retail to the consumer

324
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:12,458
is it difficult that way yeah it totally

325
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:13,299
is integrity I said it so I questioned

326
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,549
my integrity

327
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:16,990
times I mean it's been hard like it

328
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:19,299
really has this hasn't been an easy road

329
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,730
for a distributor distributor takes all

330
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,620
the brunt all the all the pain there get

331
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,750
to all the finger-pointing at him but

332
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,909
let me tell you I was expecting the

333
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,190
retail to kick up and I was expecting

334
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:32,199
the supply chain to kick off and I

335
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,630
always expect I was expecting the

336
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,720
sun-grown message to be in more volume

337
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:40,149
with more of us sharing it and you know

338
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,600
the our consumers hearing it more but

339
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:45,610
not a lot not a lot of us are driving

340
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,500
those channels of information to the

341
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:50,379
consumer at this point and this

342
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,669
distributions been it's been it's a shit

343
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:56,740
show I mean it really is so you know

344
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:58,479
stabilizing or stabilizing now like like

345
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,129
the best thing I think I did and I've

346
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,050
made a lot of mistakes but the best

347
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:04,269
thing I think I did is we phased

348
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,620
everything in when we when we went to

349
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:08,230
cultivators and I'm going to take this

350
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,000
much product in phase one and and

351
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,980
everybody's sitting at my board says

352
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,299
you're crazy why would you just take

353
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,300
that much that's nothing

354
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:23,479
you
