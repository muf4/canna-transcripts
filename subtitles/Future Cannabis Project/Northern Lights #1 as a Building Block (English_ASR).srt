1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,779
he's asking what's the major differences

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,179
between the Northern Lights cuts you

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:09,119
hold because they were all named numerix

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,468
what's the significance of that and what

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:19,350
does it mean to you and how you use them

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:20,519
so that's a very good question so we

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,320
would really need the guys here that

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,669
originally bred the northern light

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,170
strands to answer all these questions

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,029
but from what I've read and understand

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,689
and what I've heard through the cannabis

12
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:39,530
culture is Northern Lights number one is

13
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:43,530
the pure form two three were crossed

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:48,780
indicas NL five six seven eight nine

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:51,660
were crossed uh sativas the hybridize NL

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:56,850
v has the best bagged peel and the best

17
00:00:51,659 --> 00:01:03,238
marketable bud NL two has the strongest

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:07,790
most indica a lot of Juniper just real

19
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:10,408
cush smell Northern Lights number one is

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,140
the backbone of all the other ones you

21
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:17,310
can smell it in there it was the

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,009
building block it's what Neville used if

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,049
he had a clone and he wanted to recreate

24
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,909
that clone he that was the male he used

25
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,150
when he wanted to make a pure hash plant

26
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,070
off the hash plant cutting he back

27
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,219
crossed off of the Northern Lights

28
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:34,469
number one when he wanted to bring big

29
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,810
bud to the market and he just had the

30
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:40,289
big bud clone he back crossed off of

31
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,420
Northern Lights number one it's in it's

32
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,420
a real building block as far as it by

33
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,560
itself it's great smoke but it doesn't

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,560
have the back appeal
