00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,560
Thank You Ariel okay so I want to do

3
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,118
something first that's gonna be a little

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,219
weird but that's cool cuz we're gonna

5
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:24,300
get a little bit weird so can everybody

6
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:26,070
stand up please everyone it's the end of

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,080
the day we're all a little sleepy you're

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,969
probably over caffeinated at this point

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:34,259
so if you could just put down whatever

10
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:36,299
is in your hands and don't worry about

11
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:37,649
self being self-conscious and we're all

12
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:43,349
just going to shake a little

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:48,420
okay so sorry all the way up hands up if

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:01:00,829
you need shake your head keep going keep

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:01:00,829
going and then one more audible exhale

16
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,670
awesome okay now we're ready to talk

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,670

18
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:18,590
I have a heckler already what Bruce okay

20
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,509
to Ariel to everyone what a beautiful

21
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:28,368
day right can I get a round of applause

22
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:30,079
for this amazing day yeah I'm so honored

23
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:33,438
to be a part of this thank you so much

24
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:37,819
all of you okay here we are we're gonna

25
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:39,109
talk about psilocybin um that's not the

26
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:40,489
well that's okay

27
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:46,719
those aren't the slides that we had up

28
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:50,298
but that's okay so we know based on

29
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,920
evidence that psychedelic mushrooms have

30
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:54,259
been used by humans since before

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,719
recorded history

32
00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:00,709
and throughout throughout human history

33
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,450
in the 1950s there was some scientific

34
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:06,200
research and some development that was

35
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:09,560
started by some some noted folks Hoffman

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,140
among them as we know in the 1970s the

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,299
war on drugs the war on intellectual

38
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:15,919
freedom on freedom in general was

39
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:19,599
started with the Controlled Substances

40
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:22,339
Act and it pretty much sorted all

41
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,608
meaningful research on psychedelics

42
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,670
psilocybin in particular and and really

43
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:33,129
any any advances were stopped at that

44
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:36,139
time fortunately today we are seeing a

45
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:40,189
revitalization of interest and research

46
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:42,259
in the use of psilocybin and that's what

47
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:44,269
we're gonna focus on today because of

48
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:47,298
the time that we have and the panel that

49
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:49,069
we've assembled for you there are a

50
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:52,189
couple things that have have led to that

51
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:54,759
the FDA has approved psilocybin again as

52
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:57,709
a breakthrough therapy so it has allowed

53
00:02:54,759 --> 00:03:01,189
research studies at Johns Hopkins Johns

54
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:05,139
Hopkins UCLA and NYU that are studying

55
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:10,090
the therapeutic impacts of psilocybin on

56
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:14,299
depression anxiety end of life and

57
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:18,400
addiction treatments coupled with that

58
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:22,620
we now have a policy reform

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:26,010
movement that is underway Denver in May

60
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:31,000
legalized or decriminalized psilocybin

61
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:32,348
yeah really cool really amazing I don't

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,848
know why I Denver is always ahead of us

63
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:36,669
maybe it's because they're a mile high

64
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:39,539
so they just are closer I don't know

65
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:42,488
but good for them and we now have other

66
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:44,379
decriminalization measures that will be

67
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:47,830
on your ballots coming to a ballot near

68
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:50,590
you one in an Oakland and several other

69
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,420
cities and then decriminalize California

70
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,849
which we'll hear a little bit more about

71
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:56,439
because a couple of our art bar folks

72
00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:01,019
here are heavily involved in that

73
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:04,090
campaign so today we wanted to have a

74
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:06,549
high-level discussion about psilocybin

75
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,049
hopefully you will learn something you

76
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:09,909
may know a lot about it already but

77
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:13,569
hopefully you will learn something or

78
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:16,478
you will take away something that just

79
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:18,879
makes you more curious about the plant

80
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,969
about the policy reform about their

81
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:26,079
research about the mycology some sort of

82
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,520
strain of knowledge or curiosity that

83
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,918
you take away from this so that's the

84
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,799
point for today of course we have an

85
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,329
hour so we can only kind of scratch the

86
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,129
surface we've spent a whole day talking

87
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:38,769
about cannabis and could probably do it

88
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:42,219
for several more same as absolutely true

89
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:45,699
of psilocybin so to help me whet your

90
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:48,010
curiosity I have these three lovely

91
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:51,129
people here to my laps and I'd like to

92
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:54,430
introduce them so to my left is Madison

100
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,180
of you are familiar with it I was blown

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,870
away by it when I read it it's it's

102
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,519
beautifully beautifully done her partner

103

Shelby Hartman is up here in the front

104

that these two amazing young women have

105
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:28,939
started what is really a groundbreaking

106
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,890
journal so if you haven't seen it out in

107
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:35,060
the hallway go go pick it up and take a

108
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:37,219
look at that so Madison is here to help

109
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:41,060
us along this conversation and next to

110

coming to you should they gather gather

119
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,019
enough signatures and I'm sure they need

120
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,019
volunteers

121
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:17,240

126
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:34,348
therapies she is the research director

through magical plants and compounds so

131
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:52,680
thank you so much for letting me

132
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:56,848
introduce them to you okay so when we we

133
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,990
hear about research around psilocybin in

134
00:06:56,848 --> 00:07:04,468
particular being helpful for folks

135
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:07,800
healing from depression anxiety dealing

136
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:10,139
with end-of-life major illnesses what is

137
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,460
it that's happening in the brain that

138
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:16,079
makes that the case okay so we spent the

139
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,269
whole day talking about cannabis

140
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,209
research cannabis manufacturing

141
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:23,609
cultivation etc we're gonna switch gears

142
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:27,388
a little bit here with psilocybin now

143
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:30,750
just like THC psilocybin is psychoactive

144
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:32,550
so he actually changes our perception of

145
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,098
things it can rewire our brain there's

146
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,810
so many interesting things about it that

147
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:38,728
makes sense that we're talking about it

148
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,550
in the same place as we're talking about

149
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:44,550
cannabis but it all comes down to the

150
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,800
default mode Network and so the default

151
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,228
mode network is really our state of

152
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,150
consciousness our state of being it

153
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:54,360
really controls what we think about

154
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:56,399
ourselves what we think about others how

155
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,598
we think about our past how we think

156
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,568
about our future

157
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:03,209
it really is us what's interesting about

158
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:05,848
the default mode network is that that

159
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:08,399
basically it's not active when we're

160
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:10,889
consumed with thinking about tasks or

161
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,628
doing things or we're in a flows

162
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:15,000
we're like really enjoying ourselves we

163
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:17,069
sort of have turned our ego off and

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,019
we're in the present moment but when

165
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:21,270
we're not really active when we're just

166
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:23,399
sitting around or daydreaming when we're

167
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:25,438
thinking about our jobs or whatever that

168
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,679
is that's when the default mode network

169
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:31,289
is on and first started different brain

170
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,450
diseases there's actually either too

171
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:35,668
much activity of this default mode

172
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,129
network or there's too little activity

173
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:40,139
now really what is this default mode

174
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:42,000
network it's a bunch of brain regions

175
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:43,889
that are interconnected that are

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,839
communicating so different parts of your

177
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:47,819
cortex that front part of your brain

178
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,310
that does all the thinking if there's

179
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,879
too much activity there like you have in

180
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:56,849
depression you can actually have too

181
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,950
much activity there and so when you

182
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,778
think about okay I'm thinking that I'm

183
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,459
worthless or I'm thinking too much about

184
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,708
bad things that happen you're just

185
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,509
overthinking ruminating that's too much

186
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:08,879
activity in those brain regions and

187
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:12,240
that's pathological anxiety you can also

188
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,679
have similar things you can also have

189
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,169
different brain conditions when there's

190
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,838
not enough activity for example autism

191
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:21,509
there's actual evidence that shows that

192
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,490
in autism you have too little

193
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:26,490
functioning of the default mode Network

194
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,409
and that may be e underlines why there

195
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,690
are issues with connecting with other

196
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:32,578
people and also understanding emotions

197
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,820
and yourself so this default mode

198
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:38,609
network is super important so too little

199
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,589
activity too much activity is not good

200
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,690
you want balance you want that right

201
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:45,120
amount so that we understand ourselves

202
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,220
in our relationship in the world and to

203
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,959
our past behaviors and future behaviors

204
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,720
so that we can think and feel

205
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,399
comfortable with ourselves now why are

206
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,290
we talking about psychedelics in this

207
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,539
default mode Network well we actually

208
00:09:55,289 --> 00:10:01,049
know some things turn on and turn off

209
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:03,539
this default mode Network now we know

210
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:06,240
that cannabis THC can actually turn off

211
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:08,879
the default mode Network we know LSD can

212
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,509
we also know psilocybin that active

213
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:15,600
molecule that's in magic mushrooms can

214
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:18,179
turn off the default mode Network and so

215
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,490
if you're trying to help treat

216
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:21,989
depression or anxiety what you're

217
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,519
looking for is to be able to shut off

218
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,799
that hyperactive Network

219
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,620
and maybe switch off those negative

220
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:30,719
thoughts about yourself or stop thinking

221
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,389
about those traumatic experiences and

222
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,690
psilocybin is actually tool that is been

223
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:39,720
proven in clinical trials to turn off

224
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,520
this network and provide healing so if

225
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,528
you do a brain scan you can see these

226
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,389
different areas and say okay there's

227
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:46,980
less activity there and you might be

228
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:49,588
able to correlate it with people feeling

229
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,450
better so when we talk about psilocybin

230
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:53,490
mushrooms being so effective for mental

231
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,459
health there really is nothing out there

232
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:59,430
like it that can really change these

233
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:02,250
negative patterns these negative brain

234
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:04,109
patterns and help people heal excellent

235
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,589
thank you could you say a little bit dr.

236
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,778
ross about serotonin and micro dosing

237
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:10,680
and why is it that psilocybin as a

238
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:14,549
compound

239
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:18,259
mimics serotonin sure so it's really

240
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:20,579
interesting that actually psilocybin is

241
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:23,250
actually broken down into a compound

242
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,339
called salicin and it's sillas and I'm

243
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,708
sorry and it's actually very similar

244
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:32,399
serotonin and so we have this natural

245
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:34,979
fungi based compound that fits in with

246
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,159
our serotonin receptors actually

247
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:42,778
activates a subtype called serotonin

248
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:44,490
it's a 5-ht to a subtype and it's

249
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:47,309
responsible almost all psychedelics

250
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,350
stimulate the same receptor and so the

251
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:51,239
serotonin system it's not the same as

252
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,370
the endocannabinoids system so we're not

253
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,350
talking about cannabinoid receptors cb1

254
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:58,560
cb2 we're talking about these serotonin

255
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:00,778
receptors now serotonin and regulates

256
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,778
everything from how much we eat how much

257
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:06,419
we have sex how we sleep how we wake how

258
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:09,720
we think and feel the serotonin system

259
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:11,578
is what's responsible we think for any

260
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,100
depressants working so it's really an

261
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:17,338
important function of our body so if

262
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,709
psilocybin containing mushrooms contain

263
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:22,200
these compounds that can stimulate the

264
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:24,028
serotonin system again that's why it's

265
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,430
so important for mental health

266
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:29,610
now I actually did a lot of research on

267
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:31,948
both mushrooms and on a process called

268
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,778
neurogenesis and neurogenesis is the

269
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:35,429
birth of new brain cells

270
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:38,610
your brain it doesn't just happen when

271
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:40,588
you are you know a child a baby it

272
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,329
actually occurs throughout life in an

273
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:44,249
area called the hippocampus which is

274
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:46,019
your learning and memory center so we

275
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:48,930
know that certain compounds can actually

276
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:50,789
boost this neurogenesis our brain cell

277
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:53,758
development and it can actually help

278
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:55,828
rewire or your brain for healing for

279
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,620
healthy thought processes and sort of

280
00:12:55,828 --> 00:13:01,198
help again use some of those pathways

281
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,759
that are more positive rather than those

282
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,708
negative pathways that lead to

283
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:06,930
depression that lead to trauma

284
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:09,328
you know reliving trauma and things like

285
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:12,328
that so we know that psilocybin like all

286
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:15,179
the other serotonin drugs actually

287
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:16,799
stimulates neurogenesis so again if

288
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:21,419
we're looking at these compounds it's

289
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:23,219
very similar to any any substance any

290
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,349
psychedelic that is stimulating your

291
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,660
serotonin system is going to boost brain

292
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,899
cell growth it's going to rewire some of

293
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:33,120
our synaptic branches and again heal our

294
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,639
brain so it's a fantastic tool to really

295
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,110
reset our brain and set us up for

296
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,560
healing thank you yeah

297
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,529
[Music]

298
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,079
[Applause]

299
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,679
[Music]

300
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,528
[Applause]

301
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:48,878
so I want to segue from that to talking

302
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:52,899
about you know the science of the brain

303
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:56,438
to more the experience a bit and so I

304
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:58,480
want to ask Madison to talk about what

305
00:13:56,438 --> 00:14:02,289
she has learned about some scientific

306
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,558
research around the concept of mysticism

307
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:06,639
of having a mystical experience

308
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:08,799
scientists are now starting to actually

309
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,028
quantify that there are I think seven

310
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:14,438
factors and I want Madison to talk about

311
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:16,088
her research around that and she's

312
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:17,799
interviewed some of the researchers who

313
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:22,329
are have an ongoing study at Johns

314
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:23,678
Hopkins right yeah okay so we'll wait

315
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,628
you know just we're out a cannabis

316
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:27,730
conference mainly and you would think

317
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:30,670
from cannabis policy there's only two

318
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,159
ways to consume a plant there's adult

319
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:34,778
use or recreational and medical and I

320
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:37,299
think that leaves out the concept of

321
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:39,818
mysticism and spirituality as something

322
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:45,219
that is also a benefit to the consumer

323
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:46,118
so just to to lay it out there is

324
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,100
something called the quote unquote

325
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:51,490
mystical experience that science has

326
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:54,129
defined and it's been found that the

327
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:57,490
stronger your mystical experience so the

328
00:14:54,129 --> 00:15:01,899
more criteria that you kind of check off

329
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:04,749
during your psychedelic trip or you know

330
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:06,519
clinical session there's a correlation

331
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:09,339
between that and the extent to which

332
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:12,009
you're healing from addiction depression

333
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:15,509
and of life anxiety and cancer patients

334
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:18,159
and so on so to begin

335
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:20,230
it's not like scientists just discovered

336
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,269
that psychedelics can be mystical right

337
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,909
for thousands of years before this

338
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:26,879
humanity has had a religious sacred

339
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:32,649
relationship with psilocybin mushrooms

340
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:35,528
and really scientists began to pick up

341
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:38,048
on that around the 50s and 60s

342
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:40,838
so in 1962 there was something called

343
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:42,639
the Good Friday experiment that Walter

344
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:47,170
pinky did under the supervision of

345
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:50,120
Timothy Leary and the Harvard psilocybin

346
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:53,620
project and nine out of ten so they

347
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,750
recruited about twenty divinity students

348
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,850
from Boston University and nine out of

349
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,480
ten reported that they had experienced

350
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:07,430
spiritual highs with psilocybin so that

351
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:10,370
was in thousand 1962 then currently at

352
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:12,409
Johns Hopkins wrote roland griffiths

353
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:15,799
who's the head researcher there is

354
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:20,319
recruiting religious leaders from all

355
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:24,049
different faiths rabbis Imams priests

356
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:27,140
Buddhists Rohe's etc to do psilocybin

357
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:29,059
and basically the reason that religious

358
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:30,710
leaders are so important to this is that

359
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:33,559
these are people who are already who are

360
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:35,930
quote unquote already familiar with the

361
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,759
idea of a mystical experience and our

362
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:39,169
familiar talk having that conversation

363
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,069
and taught using that rhetoric

364
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:47,779
so the actual tenets of the mystical

365
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:50,360
experience are internal unity so

366
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:53,809
basically this pure awareness within

367
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,879
yourself external unity which is kind of

368
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:59,449
feeling connected and oneness with all

369
00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:04,039
other things transcendence of time and

370
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:06,049
space and ineffability or paradoxic

371
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:08,930
allottee meaning that it's hard to put

372
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:12,730
the experience into words or that you

373
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:15,920
would need to kind of use contradictory

374
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,630
descriptions to really just to say what

375
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:21,199
that felt like

376
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:23,990
a sense of sacredness and an intuitive

377
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,449
knowledge of ultimate reality so just

378
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,400
sort of you know if you've ever done

379
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,470
psilocybin you maybe have come to a

380
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,050
feeling of okay everything is okay and

381
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:37,940
this is how it is and everything is

382
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:41,659
right with the world a no-no etic

383
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,670
quality which speaks to that also sort

384
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,220
of feeling of ultimate reality ultimate

385
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:49,130
reality and then a seven is a deeply

386
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,350
felt positive mood and if you have

387
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,020
basically you're having a quote-unquote

388
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:56,329
mystical experience of about 60 to 70

389
00:17:54,019 --> 00:18:02,900
of this criteria are experienced by the

390
00:17:56,329 --> 00:18:05,000
user and so yeah so basically the main

391
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,940
thing here is that I see psychedelics is

392
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,529
sort of the intersection of science

393
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:15,080
the law and spirituality or God so a lot

394
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:18,740
of the the mechanism of action that

395
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:20,210
people are not the mechanism not not the

396
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,400
mechanism of action but the way that

397
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:25,990
people are experiencing psychedelics and

398
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,460
psychedelic assisted psychotherapy is

399
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,009
forcing scientists now to grapple with

400
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,340
the concept of mystical experience and

401
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:37,009
that's going in to the published

402
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:38,809
research and ultimately seeing now that

403
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:42,019
we're going through these fda-approved

404
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:44,450
studies I think psilocybin studies are

405
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:48,230
in Phase two if I'm not mistaken and

406
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:50,029
there are three phases the concept of

407
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,740
someone of a patient having a mystical

408
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,930
experience with God or whatever you want

409
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,519
to call it is going to pave the way for

410
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,680
a psilocybin to become a legal

411
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,190
psychedelic assisted psychotherapy tool

412
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,940
and I think that's just fascinating so

413
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:06,410
thank you Madison

414
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:10,590
[Music]

415
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:15,350
okay so speaking of God let's talk about

416
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:18,000
nature will how what is the lifecycle of

417
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:22,409
mushroom how do we get mushrooms from

418
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,380
from nature actually questions so first

419
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,400
of all we have to understand that

420
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,550
mushrooms are in a different Kingdom

421
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,830
than plants and they're actually more

422
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:33,839
closely related to humans they are

423
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:36,329
heterotrophs we are heterotrophs we get

424
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:40,079
our nutrition from out there in the

425
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:42,359
environment and not sunlight and so you

426
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:46,289
can imagine and try to imagine a tiny

427
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:51,089
spore anywhere from four to twenty

428
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:55,589
microns in length and that spore

429
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:59,250
germinates or opens up and just like the

430
00:19:55,589 --> 00:20:02,970
radical or first root of seed you have

431
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:06,990
the initial growth from the spore and

432
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:08,850
that's called hyphae and once you see

433
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,819
like a visible mass of hyphae that's

434
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:15,359
what you call mycelium and high-bay is

435
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:19,710
where all the action occurs in terms of

436
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:25,139
the metabolism until the fungus is

437
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:28,799
turned on and ready to undergo its

438
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,990
sexual reproductive cycle some fungi

439
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,710
produce mushrooms not all of them do

440
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:36,539
that so you start with a spore some

441
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,569
plants have spores like ferns these like

442
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:44,039
prehistoric really old evolved plants

443
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:47,460
have similar modes of growth and life

444
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:49,440
cycles but for for the mushrooms that

445
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,160
we're talking about you know they're

446
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,049
spreading by spores and growing into

447
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,440
their environment through extracellular

448
00:20:55,049 --> 00:21:01,279
digestion they're releasing enzymes into

449
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:04,950
the environment as well as metabolites

450
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:07,339
acids bases basically they're trying to

451
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,830
create a suitable environment for their

452
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:13,250
sometimes they are parasitic in nature

453
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:17,509
sometimes they are symbiotic in the form

454
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:20,269
of helping out plant roots so we're here

455
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:22,359
at a cannabis conference you maybe some

456
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:24,500
of you are growers and you've used

457
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:28,789
fertilizers and compost that have been

458
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:32,230
inoculated with mycorrhizae fungi that

459
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:36,259
are supposed to help those plant roots

460
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:39,230
do a slightly better job of mining the

461
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:41,390
soil for nutrients and so fungi grow in

462
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:45,559
all sorts of different substrates or

463
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:47,480
foods they can grow you know in wood

464
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:50,839
makes them very special that they can

465
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:53,660
break down laitanan the scylla a lot of

466
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:56,000
the psilocybin mushroom containing

467
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,759
mushrooms which there are over 200

468
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,140
species a lot of them are associated

469
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:04,730
with dung and growing out of cow patties

470
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,020
for instance you've probably heard that

471
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:10,519
you know people go picking in ranchers

472
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:14,059
lands and maybe get scared off with a

473
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:17,900
shotgun or something but people think

474
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:19,669
that the psilocybin and psilocin and

475
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,360
these psychoactive components are

476
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:28,370
actually an evolutionary trait by the

477
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:31,819
mushroom to ward off insects insects are

478
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:33,799
very common in like as a pest in the

479
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:36,889
mushroom growing industry like fungus

480
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:39,619
fungal gnats a real big problem flat

481
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,660
different types of flies and so there

482
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:44,569
have been studies that shown that

483
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:47,210
insects that have been fed psychedelic

484
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:49,759
mushrooms essentially or like maybe

485
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:52,519
synthetic psilocybin actually have a

486
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:55,009
reduced appetite and so those

487
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:56,660
psychoactive components are a pest at

488
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:58,789
orient or like an anti orb every

489
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:03,290
compound and then I'll just add that

490
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:06,409
this is this trait or this gene complex

491
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:09,240
that's responsible for producing these

492
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:13,529
psychoactive components of

493
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:16,500
psilocybin tolson they've they've shown

494
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:19,680
up in all these unrelated mushroom

495
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,839
species mentioned 200 but these

496
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,060
mushrooms are not actually very closely

497
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:27,689
related and so there was a paper

498
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:33,419
released a couple years ago that gets

499
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:34,950
into the perhaps the origin of the

500
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,340
extreme number of times that this popped

501
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:42,779
up in in uncommon mushrooms so the idea

502
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:45,839
is positive that perhaps bacteria are

503
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:48,750
doing horizontal gene transfer fungi

504
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:52,519
have also been shown to be able to move

505
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:56,039
these genes so when when the - connect

506
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:58,319
through a process called hasmig me and

507
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:03,420
karaoke you know they're sharing genetic

508
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:06,059
material and so you find that this trait

509
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,710
has been transferred over to many

510
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:10,879
different mushrooms because it's

511
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:14,640
evolutionary evolutionarily advantageous

512
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:18,570
to improve their fitness and I find that

513
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,820
simply remarkable that hereditary you

514
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:22,529
know like the genes response that are I

515
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:25,200
passed down from one generation to

516
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:29,579
generation are not the only means to

517
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,710
which these these properties are are

518
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:34,740
cast on are transferred in the

519
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:37,680
environment and dr. Roston I were

520
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,720
talking about epigenetics more on the

521
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,970
the human side of it maybe we could get

522
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,460
a little bit into that later and how

523
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:49,380
some of these these medicinal properties

524
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:51,900
have such a long lasting effects and I

525
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:56,130
just wanted to have Madison I think

526
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:58,920
didn't they talk to those patients like

527
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:01,420
like 20 years ago or excepting goblin

528
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,940
didn't follow up yes when a

529
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:14,390
yeah so Rick Doblin followed up with oh

530
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:16,900
sorry about that okay right sorry so

531
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:20,150
basically Rick Doblin followed up with

532
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:23,000
with some of the people who were it

533
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:26,960
during the Good Friday experiment and he

534
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,990
did find some sort of methodological

535
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:34,329
holes in in the experiment that

536
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:37,430
double-blind nature of it wasn't as

537
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:39,259
foolproof as double-blind studies are

538
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:43,640
supposed to be and just to explain what

539
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:46,309
double-blind is is neither the subject

540
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,740
nor the researcher knows what they're

541
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:51,679
taking so in that experiment this

542
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,420
placebo was an act of placebo there was

543
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,100
still a little bit of an effect so it

544
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,700
wouldn't be totally obvious because they

545
00:25:55,099 --> 00:26:00,289
were all sort of in the same environment

546
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:03,380
but he had found some holes in it but

547
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:05,149
the bottom line is is that and döblin

548
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,420
wrote this is that the drug and

549
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:12,140
drug-induced mysticism is not inferior

550
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:15,680
to other types of mysticism so the idea

551
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:18,350
being that you can have a very

552
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:22,549
legitimate mystical spiritual religious

553
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:25,339
experience from psilocybin and again now

554
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:27,740
researchers at Johns Hopkins and NYU

555
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:30,049
have been going on to kind of pick up

556
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,690
where the Good Friday experiment left

557
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:36,129
and goblins follow-up which was in 1987

558
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:41,480
left off and that's an ongoing study now

559
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:44,150
but yeah and another researcher Charles

560
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,700
Grove who's at UCLA has talked about the

561
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:50,240
concept of applied mysticism and I think

562
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:53,930
what mushrooms are forcing scientists to

563
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,150
do is to look at the shamanic history

564
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:58,460
and sacred and spiritual uses of

565
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:01,070
psilocybin long before science really or

566
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,829
Western scientists at our universities

567
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:06,589
here quote/unquote discovered them and

568
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:07,939
it's realizing that and we write about

569
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:13,069
this in double-blind as the differ

570
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:15,528
which is synthetic psilocybin experience

571
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:20,119
and actually taking the real mushrooms

572
00:27:15,528 --> 00:27:21,378
which come with other probably you can

573
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:23,209
explain what else is in the real

574
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:25,009
mushrooms versus less synthetic isolate

575
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:27,079
of psilocybin but there's a lot that's

576
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:30,740
lost in synthesis and in the experience

577
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:33,798
of sitting in a room with blindfolds and

578
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,870
two therapists a man and a woman for six

579
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:38,628
hours or however long your experiences

580
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:41,239
versus doing it in a ceremonial

581
00:27:38,628 --> 00:27:42,798
environment with a medicine person or a

582
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,220
shaman or whatever you want to call it

583
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:48,528
with songs and in with basically the

584
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:51,259
cultural technology that humanity has

585
00:27:48,528 --> 00:27:54,288
used for centuries that goes along with

586
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:57,110
psilocybin and I wanted to jump in there

587
00:27:54,288 --> 00:28:00,259
and talk about why it's so important to

588
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:02,298
decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms right

589
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:04,730
we've heard about the Mapp studies right

590
00:28:02,298 --> 00:28:07,190
eventually after these the clinical

591
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:10,099
trial process goes through they've shown

592
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:13,820
advocacy for using psilocybin to treat

593
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:14,959
anxiety in addiction all sorts of

594
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:17,839
different things that it will be

595
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,269
approved as a pharmaceutical drug that a

596
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,128
doctor will have to prescribe well if we

597
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:25,579
look at the history of cannabis for

598
00:28:22,128 --> 00:28:28,609
example THC was approved in 1985 as

599
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:31,369
Marinol CBD was just approved as a

600
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:35,599
pharmaceutical drug as epidemics for

601
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:38,209
epilepsy now is cannabis legal nope it's

602
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:41,240
still illegal federally so legalizing

603
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,798
just an isolated chemical or active

604
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,519
ingredient in these plant based

605
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:52,158
substances did not actually the legality

606
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:54,579
of the the whole plant okay so it's

607
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,690
really important for us to look at

608
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:59,418
decriminalizing the mushroom itself

609
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,759
because again we want people to be able

610
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:03,288
to access a mushroom we want to be able

611
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,288
to access something that you can grow

612
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:09,109
safely at home and consume and there are

613
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:11,980
benefits to using these substances at

614
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:14,658
home and also there's benefits to using

615
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:17,360
magic mushrooms or psilocybin mushrooms

616
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:18,530
at different doses at dosages so we

617
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,559
talked a little bit about

618
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:24,349
whole experiences no that's sort of a

619
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,899
macro dose so very large joes that's

620
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:29,599
intended to have lucid genic properties

621
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:32,330
you can also use psilocybin mushrooms at

622
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:35,299
micro doses so these are doses a little

623
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:37,339
bit under half a gram that might not

624
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:39,319
really produce any type of hallucination

625
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:41,119
or any psycho activity you just might

626
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,889
feel maybe a little bit more focused a

627
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,379
little bit more clear a little bit more

628
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,720
creative for somebody who's in pain with

629
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,400
fibromyalgia for example like myself you

630
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,559
might micro dose to actually distract

631
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,550
you a little bit from them pain so

632
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,230
there's a whole bunch of different

633
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:56,359
reasons why somebody would micro dose

634
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,950
and you're not going to get that miss

635
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:59,419
school experience but you're still going

636
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,210
to get benefits and there's even

637
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:04,370
clinical research suggesting improving

638
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,289
some of those benefits that it's not

639
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:08,750
just placebo that you can take small

640
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:11,480
amounts of psilocybin mushrooms and

641
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,309
actually benefit from it you can also

642
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,920
take those macro doses and there's other

643
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:17,750
purposes and set in setting that is

644
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,240
going to actually help you get those

645
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:22,640
benefits out of mushrooms so very much

646
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,930
like THC where you can do micro dosing

647
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,580
where you're not high but you're still

648
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,950
getting anxiety relief or a little bit

649
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:29,960
of pain relief or you can take those big

650
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,000
doses and feel great or even have a

651
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,220
mystical experience it's very similar

652
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,509
and I just wanted to touch on that that

653
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,700
there's many different ways to use

654
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:39,500
psilocybin mushrooms and it's going to

655
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,470
be different than just taking say a

656
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,660
psilocybin pill great Thank You Michele

657
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,789
but actually segues to a question I

658
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,200
wanted to ask you all about leading to

659
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:49,639
legalization but if there was something

660
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:58,700
else you wanted to add well before we do

661
00:30:49,640 --> 00:31:00,259
that go ahead are so afraid of this

662
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,660
mystical experience that they're

663
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:05,390
actually prescribing alongside these

664
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:09,200
legal ketamine treatments a drug that

665
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:12,500
will deactivate or prevent the mystical

666
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,090
experience and to me you're kind of

667
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,659
robbing people of this healing

668
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:19,118
experience and I'm

669
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:22,960
a big proponent of the kind of whole

670
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:25,720
plant or a whole mushroom medicine and

671
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,329
that it's important sometimes to go

672
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,909
through some of that like anxiety or

673
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:33,970
like nausea associated that you might be

674
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:36,070
have associated with trips on on

675
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,528
mushrooms because that's your body

676
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:41,288
telling you to get rid of something and

677
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:45,069
and I think that's equally as important

678
00:31:41,288 --> 00:31:48,669
as the euphoria and the kind of be the

679
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:51,098
feel-good parts of yeah thank you so

680
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:52,538
much so so before I do that actually

681
00:31:51,098 --> 00:31:54,848
I'll ask I'll ask this question because

682
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:56,739
it leads it it piggyback stuff what you

683
00:31:54,848 --> 00:31:58,749
all were just speaking about so we heard

684
00:31:56,739 --> 00:32:02,710
about the entourage effect in cannabis

685
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:05,108
today in quite a bit is there well I

686
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,629
guess do we have any research about

687
00:32:05,108 --> 00:32:09,848
whether whole mushroom versus a

688
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:12,158
synthetic psilocybin whether there's a

689
00:32:09,848 --> 00:32:15,759
difference and are there other compounds

690
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:18,519
besides Sullivan that are active in in

691
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:21,788
the the psychedelic component of a

692
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:23,919
mushroom sure yes so it's a really good

693
00:32:21,788 --> 00:32:26,288
question because this is a good kind of

694
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,269
parallel between cannabis although I I

695
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:29,798
would say in my limited and

696
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:34,288
understanding that it's much more

697
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:38,710
complex with with cannabis but yeah so

698
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:42,148
we talked about psilocybin it breaks

699
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:45,608
down our D phosphorylates into solo sin

700
00:32:42,148 --> 00:32:49,538
and then there's a breakdown of that

701
00:32:45,608 --> 00:32:51,220
into bassist Dean bassist in and then

702
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:53,648
there's a breakdown of that in tune or

703
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:57,909
bassist in and I think there's many more

704
00:32:53,648 --> 00:33:00,189
compounds that were still very like

705
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:01,840
novice and still having really

706
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,519
researched and that's part of why we

707
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,738
want to decriminalize mushrooms so we

708
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,618
can actually like fully carry out this

709
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:11,019
research but most of the time folks are

710
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:15,548
are looking at the compare the ratio

711
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:17,618
between psilocybin and psilocin and most

712
00:33:15,548 --> 00:33:20,499
of the times people are cultivating or

713
00:33:17,618 --> 00:33:23,918
talking about q Benzies which are one of

714
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:26,950
like the lesser active mushrooms

715
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,759
it's like third out of out of these like

716
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:34,710
200 but I think we've still got like

717
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:37,589
to learn also the mycelium of of these

718
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:40,529
fungi can also have active components

719
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:41,970
meaning that the mycelium and not just

720
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:45,269
the mushroom have psilocybin and

721
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:48,329
psilocin and it has a different

722
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:51,180
structure in its and its you know it's a

723
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:52,829
different morphology so I you could

724
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:55,650
reason to think that it has a different

725
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:56,250
metabolism in your body as well great

726
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,140
thank you

727
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,240
how exciting is that by the way I just

728
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,950
wanted stress like how many strains of

729
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,109
cannabis are like thinking about all the

730
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:06,779
different cultivars like over 200

731
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:08,460
mushrooms that contain psilocybin we may

732
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:10,980
find out that some are great for PTSD

733
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,619
for example some are great for pain like

734
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:17,570
we are just scratching the surface on

735
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:20,210
what we know and what we could learn so

736
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:22,740
we for those of you who don't know

737
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,920
psilocybin is a Schedule one drug

738
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,449
so just same as cannabis no accepted use

739
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,519
by the by the federal government so

740
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:31,589
still Schedule one and in California we

741
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:35,429
are one of a handful of states that

742
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:38,190
actually make it a crime to possess the

743
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:41,460
spores of a psychedelic mushroom Idaho

744
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:44,190
and Georgia there we go we're in great

745
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,740
company there so that leads to my next

746
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:48,480
question okay so I I came to learn when

747
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:52,469
I was getting ready for this talk that

748
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,170
there is a bit of a debate among learned

749
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:58,039
learned people in this area about

750
00:34:55,170 --> 00:35:00,420
weather policy reform should give way to

751
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:02,880
scientific research and we should wait I

752
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,840
think there's definitely some hold over

753
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:10,110
from Timothy Leary in the 70s there's

754
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,820
definitely a there was a feeling in the

755
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:14,610
scientific community that that really

756
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,620
set things back in a major way whether

757
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:18,990
you believe that or not or whether

758
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:20,969
that's factually accurate but it is the

759
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:22,439
case that that folks do kind of have

760
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:24,659
this there's a little bit of a debate

761
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,730
about whether we should not legalize

762
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:28,529
should not decriminalize so that we can

763
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,900
let science scientists do their work and

764
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:33,390
then we'll come to it later once we have

765
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:36,720
more information as opposed to folks who

766
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:38,858
say no we need to decriminalize because

767
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,959
one is just about fundamental free

768
00:35:38,858 --> 00:35:42,578
but second that really it supports the

769
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,380
kind of research that we actually need

770
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:47,680
to do and maybe that leads to the idea

771
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:50,440
of whole mushroom as opposed to just a

772
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:53,429
synthetic or a or an isolate of a

773
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,019
certain compound and how it might also

774
00:35:53,429 --> 00:35:58,239
how legalization might relate to the

775
00:35:56,018 --> 00:36:00,608
actual experience that that folks would

776
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,228
have when they are on it so whoever

777
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:04,719
wants to take it first what do you what

778
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:08,318
say you about legalization versus policy

779
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:10,179
reform you know yeah you know as a

780
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:11,710
scientist it's sort of funny I never

781
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:13,298
really thought I would get involved in

782
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:15,068
drug policy or a forum we're supposed to

783
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:16,778
get you know not play in politics

784
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:18,639
especially when the government is the

785
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:19,719
one funding or not funding your research

786
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,598
right

787
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:24,159
it took me actually leaving academia to

788
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,470
and actually founding my own nonprofit

789
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:29,710
and working with groups like drug policy

790
00:36:26,469 --> 00:36:31,449
Alliance to actually have the voice to

791
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,608
make change and so when we talk about

792
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:36,548
scientists not being you shouldn't be

793
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:38,768
getting involved in drug reform well the

794
00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:41,018
fact that these substances are federally

795
00:36:38,768 --> 00:36:44,078
illegal actually does hamper research

796
00:36:41,018 --> 00:36:47,018
for example if you have patients that

797
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,568
with anxiety depression for example that

798
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:52,238
might benefit from consuming psilocybin

799
00:36:49,568 --> 00:36:54,248
mushrooms but are scared of getting them

800
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:55,929
because they're illegal right they're

801
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:57,848
scared of losing their children losing

802
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:59,949
their job getting drug tested whatever

803
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:02,170
it is they're not gonna participate even

804
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:04,838
in an observational study right even if

805
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,909
it's just an app that's saying hey tell

806
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:09,460
us what kind of mushroom you took how

807
00:37:06,909 --> 00:37:11,710
much you did it what you did how it felt

808
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,690
like maybe record your trip not everyone

809
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:15,219
is gonna be open to doing that and so

810
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:18,338
it's really hard for us to collect data

811
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:20,829
when it is still a Schedule one drug and

812
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:23,349
there are state and federal penalties

813
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:26,140
associated with it we saw this in states

814
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:28,450
where cannabis was illegal you know if

815
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:30,429
you were fearful about going to jail if

816
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:31,778
you reported your use you weren't gonna

817
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:33,759
fill out that app you weren't gonna

818
00:37:31,778 --> 00:37:35,349
participate in that research study you

819
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:37,960
are really scared and I think that

820
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:41,440
legalization will help improve our

821
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,478
ability to do some of the research again

822
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,150
we're gonna have to go in baby steps

823
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:48,429
right California first states first and

824
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,119
then hopefully federal level will change

825
00:37:48,429 --> 00:37:52,730
at some point but it will help

826
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:56,150
stigmatize the use and also distinct

827
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:58,219
eyes the research around it and I think

828
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:00,289
that research is a really big part of

829
00:37:58,219 --> 00:38:02,778
decriminalized California we want to

830
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:04,700
learn how it's helping people we want to

831
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:06,829
learn if it's safe or not safe for

832
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:10,129
certain groups what the research shows

833
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:11,390
us right now is that it's pretty safe we

834
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:13,249
want to be able to practice harm

835
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:15,379
reduction rather than saying wait we

836
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:18,348
need more research there's a radio over

837
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:21,019
30 clinical trials on clinical trial gov

838
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:22,490
on psilocybin you can see all the

839
00:38:21,018 --> 00:38:24,949
different studies out there it's been

840
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:27,169
researched it can be researched more but

841
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:28,848
we cannot accept things like you know

842
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,380
our government saying there's not enough

843
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:32,359
research on cannabis that's why it's

844
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,130
still Schedule one you know how many

845
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:36,619
more studies would do we need it's sort

846
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:40,068
of this limiting fear-based

847
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:42,559
approach to you know drug reform policy

848
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:43,969
rather than saying hey you know we have

849
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,789
better ins Dyne we have people dying

850
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:48,828
from depression right through suicide 25

851
00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:50,599
percent of people with depression are

852
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:52,730
treatment resistant that means no

853
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:54,920
pharmaceutical or other treatment is

854
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,389
going to dent their depression are we

855
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,269
gonna wait for them to commit suicide

856
00:38:56,389 --> 00:39:02,420
are we going to allow them compassionate

857
00:38:59,268 --> 00:39:04,608
access to a again a fungus that grows

858
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,739
from the ground that could be beneficial

859
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:08,960
for their depression you know as a

860
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:10,730
scientist to me I hope and there's other

861
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,059
scientists here that you feel compelled

862
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:16,579
to go with your heart to change laws to

863
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:19,630
participate in this research and again

864
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:22,039
moral obligation to change really bad

865
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:24,519
drug laws in this state and in this

866
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:24,519
country

867
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:37,380
I thought you might say that okay will

868
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,859
you want to go next

869
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:42,570
sure yeah that was amazing fully yeah I

870
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:44,819
agree with everything you're saying I

871
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,309
actually started off as a Poli Sci major

872
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:51,300
in college I'm so glad I didn't but I'm

873
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:54,059
also so glad I am sitting up here with

874
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,670
these professionals talking about drug

875
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:59,210
reform one thing that I just want to

876
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:03,050
vibe off of from this conference

877
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:07,800
thinking about the talk about the

878
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:10,200
Mississippi like dirt weed you know what

879
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,940
I think of and there's this controversy

880
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,848
right now happening with this

881
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:18,358
organization called compass and there's

882
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:21,359
this real fear that they are creating

883
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:26,338
this monopoly on synthetic psilocybin

884
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:30,389
and so by keeping it illegal you're able

885
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:33,239
to consolidate that power and money into

886
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:35,338
a small group of people when we're

887
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:38,039
talking about something that has been

888
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:42,289
used traditionally throughout the world

889
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:46,800
I would add this is a global you know a

890
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:49,349
phenomenon by like you know in tradition

891
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,440
for thousands of years and and at the

892
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:56,730
end of the day for all the therapeutic

893
00:40:52,440 --> 00:41:00,869
medicinal and spiritual at benefits and

894
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:04,559
bandages I'm of the mind I think as with

895
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:06,930
many people in this room that it's it's

896
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:09,150
a problem with the government telling us

897
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:12,000
what we can and can't do with our bodies

898
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:16,070
and I have a big problem with that

899
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,070
and think that should change immediately

900
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:17,429
[Applause]

901
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,909
[Music]

902
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:22,109
[Applause]

903
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:22,109
[Music]

904
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:29,190
as a journalist I'm not really supposed

905
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:31,799
to take an official opinion on this as a

906
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:34,470
human being I don't think anyone should

907
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,110
be in jail for a plant or a fungus and

908
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:40,500
so automatically I believe in

909
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:43,050
decriminalization and to your point I

910
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,539
mean one thing is that the FDA approved

911
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:48,350
trials that's gonna pharmaceutical eyes

912
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:52,099
these substances in a synthetic format

913
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:55,110
which would mean legally then taking a

914
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:57,509
whole mushroom doesn't mean the same

915
00:41:55,110 --> 00:42:00,000
thing as taking a synthetic pill or

916
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:04,080
capsule of psilocybin and that's just

917
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,119
false so one thing that I'm worried

918
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,579
about and I wrote about this also in

919
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,409
double-blind is what can the

920
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:14,849
up-and-coming psychedelic industry learn

921
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:17,009
from cannabis one thing is compass again

922
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:18,869
does pose a serious concern about a

923
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:22,290
monopoly on pharmaceutical eyes

924
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:25,769
psilocybin and also whether it's compass

925
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:26,849
or some other company the idea I mean

926
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:28,909
there are still gonna be questions of

927
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:30,839
accessibility access affordability

928
00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:33,299
whether this will be covered by

929
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,430
insurance and stuff like that which will

930
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,080
make it so that most people are not most

931
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:38,879
people but a certain class of people are

932
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:40,980
able to access psychedelic assisted

933
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,410
psychotherapy and everyone else is still

934
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:46,829
gonna have to risk their legal freedoms

935
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:48,659
to get the same benefits or not even the

936
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:51,210
same benefits one thing I also want to

937
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:54,059
note is that there's a lot of enthusiasm

938
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:55,769
around this and a lot of the benefits

939
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:57,719
that people are getting from psychedelic

940
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:59,849
psychedelic assisted psychotherapy is

941
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:01,739
happening specifically in that context

942
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:03,900
of psychedelic assisted psychotherapy

943
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:05,129
not necessarily like out with your

944
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,599
friends or at a party or whatever

945
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:09,780
sometimes you are going to have an

946
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:12,329
amazing transformative experience in an

947
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,980
unregulated or on clinical setting but

948
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:15,599
the results that we're seeing are only

949
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:20,400
specifically in those clinical settings

950
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:22,139
so in order to whether or not you know

951
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,059
the majority of these psychedelics

952
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:26,429
whether it's MDMA or psilocybin and so

953
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:28,049
forth are available through the

954
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:30,869
pharmaceutical eyes model or through

955
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:32,460
decriminalization I think that's

956
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:34,170
something that right now psychedelic

957
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,389
industry people and advic

958
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:39,150
it's an act activists and scientists are

959
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:41,250
gonna have to ask themselves as we go

960
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,800
forward and vote for decriminalize

961
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:50,369
California and everything else awesome

962
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:52,440
thank you okay so we have we have just a

963
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:54,389
few minutes left so I want to do a

964
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,860
little bit of a lightning round I have a

965
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:59,759
couple questions I want to ask each of

966
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:00,900
the each of the folks up here Madison

967
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,980
will start with you since we've started

968
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:07,950
down at the other end so can you share

969
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:10,800
what a book or a study or an article or

970
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:12,559
a song or a poem or a finding or

971
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,120
something that you would like to share

972
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:18,059
that will spark curiosity

973
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,710
yeah so I one thing is that when we talk

974
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:21,480
about psychedelics we talk about the

975
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:22,860
Wellness of the individual and the

976
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,590
Wellness of the collective and the good

977
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:28,550
and I or the good of kind of everybody

978
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:30,570
at large and so I think that a

979
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,160
psychedelics have the power not just to

980
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:33,570
transform a person but then to transform

981
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:36,089
the way they vote or the way that they

982
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,590
are a political citizen and wherever

983
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,930
they are and wherever they're living so

984
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:41,370
there's one study that Natalie Ginsburg

985
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:43,500
from Maps the multidisciplinary

986
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:46,559
Association for psychedelic studies is

987
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,449
doing which is looking at ayahuasca in

988
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:58,170
conflict resolution between Israelis and

989
00:44:48,449 --> 00:45:00,899
Palestinians yeah so I I think that

990
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:02,579
whether or not not everyone in a

991
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,680
conflict zone is going to have access to

992
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:06,569
psychedelics but I think as we start to

993
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:08,609
apply psychedelic principles and ethos

994
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,019
to the way that we approach policies and

995
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,630
politics and the way you vote that's

996
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:17,480
really gonna transform the current

997
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:20,250
paradigm thank you well yeah I'm

998
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,829
inspired by the work of Paul Stamets

999
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,760
he wrote yeah a couple fans in the

1000
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:27,989
audience

1001
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,270
yeah he wrote the sillas psilocybin

1002
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:33,689
mushrooms of the world I believe in the

1003
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:37,349
90s oh yeah

1004
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:40,230
so Stamets but psilocybin mushrooms of

1005
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:41,699
the world one study I mean there's

1006
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:42,990
there's starting to be so many studies

1007
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:45,629
where you mentor like 30 years or

1008
00:45:42,989 --> 00:45:49,049
something on psilocybin just something

1009
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:50,190
personally I have a brother with he's on

1010
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:54,539
the autism spectrum

1011
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:57,150
and they're looking at anxiety you know

1012
00:45:54,539 --> 00:46:00,000
reducing social anxiety in people with

1013
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:01,769
with with autism I'm like I would never

1014
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,690
have thought like my brother should be a

1015
00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:05,909
micro dosing well like yeah maybe you

1016
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:09,889
should you know so it's challenging like

1017
00:46:05,909 --> 00:46:12,719
even my kind of narrower view of

1018
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:15,690
psychedelics which I think as a society

1019
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:19,500
we're all going to be doing or all we

1020
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:21,630
are doing right now I really believe in

1021
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,820
the power of psilocybin mushrooms to

1022
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:28,950
heal the world we're sort of in a bad

1023
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:31,410
place right now right there are two

1024
00:46:28,949 --> 00:46:34,500
studies in particular that show the

1025
00:46:31,409 --> 00:46:37,108
power of magic mushrooms to heal some of

1026
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:39,599
our social ills one is the fact that

1027
00:46:37,108 --> 00:46:41,279
taking psilocybin mushrooms not in a

1028
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,559
clinical setting not as a psilocybin

1029
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,930
capsule just any point it could haven't

1030
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:48,269
been in a concert you went to right just

1031
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:51,358
consuming psilocybin mushrooms at least

1032
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:54,030
once in your life reduces your risk of

1033
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:56,340
overdosing on opioids so you're going to

1034
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:58,140
make some better choices in life somehow

1035
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,240
it's happening I can't tell you the

1036
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:02,759
mechanism for that but you have a lower

1037
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,039
risk secondly we talked about domestic

1038
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,810
violence in this country and also trauma

1039
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:08,820
that women have to endure every day you

1040
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:10,590
know we talked about the me to movement

1041
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,869
like things like that there's a lot of

1042
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:15,210
stuff women go through and if we could

1043
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:17,250
reduce domestic violence we were to

1044
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:19,230
reduce trauma being handed down from

1045
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:22,199
generation to generation there is a

1046
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:24,780
study that shows consuming psilocybin

1047
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:26,460
mushrooms reduces domestic violence and

1048
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,190
reduces violence in general

1049
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:32,369
so again healing the world through less

1050
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:35,750
violence more love what more can we ask

1051
00:47:32,369 --> 00:47:35,750
this mushroom for right

1052
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:43,409
[Applause]

1053
00:47:40,728 --> 00:47:45,058
okay last question rather than take

1054
00:47:43,409 --> 00:47:47,699
questions because everybody wants a

1055
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:49,499
drink and some food and you can come ask

1056
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:51,838
these folks questions afterwards I'm

1057
00:47:49,498 --> 00:47:56,669
gonna have each of them give you a

1058
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:58,018
question to take away okay so we didn't

1059
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:00,179
we didn't actually ask how many people

1060
00:47:58,018 --> 00:48:02,879
even consumed psilocybin mushrooms here

1061
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:05,309
either at macro doses or micro doses but

1062
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,219
what I want you to do is take if you are

1063
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:09,929
new to this learn about this tell

1064
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:11,999
somebody about this and I want to

1065
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:14,189
recommend a website that has great

1066
00:48:11,998 --> 00:48:17,578
information on psychedelics in general

1067
00:48:14,188 --> 00:48:20,428
and their benefits risk implication for

1068
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:23,339
legalizing etc it's called drugs over

1069
00:48:20,429 --> 00:48:25,559
dinner org hosted dinner party let's

1070
00:48:23,338 --> 00:48:27,420
talk about psilocybin maybe your mom has

1071
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:30,359
done it you know like let's normalize

1072
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:31,920
the conversation about psilocybin

1073
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:33,869
mushrooms in the same way that we did

1074
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,699
with cannabis and you might find that

1075
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,920
more people are open to it than you

1076
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:40,139
thought I mean we are pretty much in Los

1077
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,239
Angeles but not in other cities around

1078
00:48:40,139 --> 00:48:47,548
the world let's start the conversation

1079
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:49,619
please spark that conversation okay yeah

1080
00:48:47,548 --> 00:48:54,599
I've had a lot of thoughts about this

1081
00:48:49,619 --> 00:49:00,179
and just purely as a as a mycologist

1082
00:48:54,599 --> 00:49:03,329
thinking about how my ecology has a role

1083
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:06,119
in the work that you do whether that's

1084
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:08,670
if you're a grower if it's a pest that's

1085
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:12,119
a problem like powdery mildew or the

1086
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:17,400
mycorrhizae that are helping your plants

1087
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:20,849
roots or in remediation of the soil I I

1088
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:23,759
think we all need to open our minds to

1089
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:26,910
all the uses of my ecology in our lives

1090
00:49:23,759 --> 00:49:30,438
psychedelic non psychedelic and just

1091
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:33,420
bring bringing forth this conversation

1092
00:49:30,438 --> 00:49:35,278
excellent Thank You Madison so you're

1093
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,159
I'm gonna guess a lot of you are in the

1094
00:49:35,278 --> 00:49:39,929
cannabis space ask yourself how you feel

1095
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,578
about the regulations and the way the

1096
00:49:39,929 --> 00:49:42,160
cannabis industry looks right now and

1097
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,960
then

1098
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:47,699
ask yourself if that's what you want for

1099
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:49,470
psilocybin great question great question

1100

little personal touch here I just want

1106
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,820
to read a short poem to you that speaks

1107
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:10,469
to my experience with with psilocybin

1108
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:14,750
