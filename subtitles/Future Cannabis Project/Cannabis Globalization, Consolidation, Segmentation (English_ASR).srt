2
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:13,019
my name is Andrea spiders wha I am the

3
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:15,718
science editor at cannabis Business

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,960
Times I'm joined today by the Whitney

5
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:22,469
who is the vice president and senior

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,380
economist at new frontier data in this

7
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:27,210
session on globalization consolidation

8
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:30,178
and segmentation we're going to be

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,039
discussing production shifts as global

10
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:34,619
markets open up how the US will play a

11
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,600
role in the expanding markets the cost

12
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,849
structures that will be needed to

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,219
compete moving forward in the next five

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,570
years and what sort of policy standards

15
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,120
will need to be put in place to help

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,759
that in to help steer the industry

17
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,890
towards sustainability though I'd like

18
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,159
to start a little with an introduction

19
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,109
into how you got became interested in

20
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,689
cannabis economics and how a new

21
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:59,159
frontier data has enabled you to further

22
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:02,849
your interests and have a voice in

23
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:06,329
market trajectory yeah thank you thank

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,700
you very much and it's just a pleasure

25
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:12,359
to be here so I really want to thank all

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,760
those involved for allowing me to have a

27
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,329
little bit of a venue today to talk

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,189
about the global cannabis marketplace

29
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:22,920
I've been in the cannabis industry for

30
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:26,789
about five years now I was teaching in

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,790
economics class and one of my students

32
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,829
started asking about how to set up

33
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,759
companies how to set up business

34
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:37,649
structures and like he let me know that

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,618
he was in the cannabis industry and this

36
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,450
is in Oregon and I asked him how large

37
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:46,709
the market was and he said I don't know

38
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:49,379
you're the economist you told me and so

39
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:51,118
I was very intellectually curious I

40
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,219
wasn't in the in the space I was

41
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:57,560
teaching economics working in high-tech

42
00:01:53,219 --> 00:02:00,539
industry and so I just went for it and

43
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,600
realizing how large that market was in

44
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,290
Oregon I decided to do this full-time

45
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:10,318
and as a result I put together a

46
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,590
forecast for Oregon first and then

47
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,318
national

48
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,348
around that time new frontier data was

49
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:19,268
getting started they realized that there

50
00:02:17,348 --> 00:02:21,789
wasn't a whole lot of data in the space

51
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:23,859
a lot of policy decisions were being

52
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:26,318
made in a vacuum or based upon headlines

53
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:28,930
somebody getting really high in Colorado

54
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:33,098
and not being able to leave their hotel

55
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:35,468
room for example and so so they realized

56
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:37,628
that there was an absence of data they

57
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:39,669
went about it on the East Coast I was

58
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:41,848
doing similar efforts on the west coast

59
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:45,729
and then about three years ago we

60
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:50,018
combined our intellect and and insights

61
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:52,238
and it's been amazing ever since the one

62
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,819
thing that's interesting is that five

63
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,870
years ago I was you know this dorky

64
00:02:54,818 --> 00:03:00,328
economists in a sweater vest right and

65
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,099
over the course of that five years now

66
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:06,280
I've been to practically every continent

67
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:08,560
we talked about policy for hemp and

68
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,769
higher THC cannabis and Zimbabwe last

69
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,530
year heading to Berlin for the ICBC

70
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:16,658
conference in April the second time

71
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,579
we've been speaking there went down to

72
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:21,120
Panama and a lot of these conversations

73
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:24,310
were with Ministry level members

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,810
presidential advisors and alike so who

75
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,150
would have thought five years ago that

76
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,400
that would be the course of cannabis

77
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,849
five years later so it's been an amazing

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,530
journey where are we now in terms of US

79
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:38,108
production environments in terms of

80
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,930
indoor outdoor and greenhouse sort of

81
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:44,919
ratios so a lot of the a lot of the

82
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:48,699
cultivation right now is kind of forced

83
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:52,150
indoors due to the illegalities the

84
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:55,449
higher THC cannabis production however a

85
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:58,930
lot of the production in say on the west

86
00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:01,000
coast is done outdoors and so you know

87
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,310
it's being the outdoor crops are being

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,739
exported to other places around the

89
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:11,620
country so you know I think 81 percent

90
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:14,289
of all of the cultivation is sold

91
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,408
through illicit channels so there's a

92
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:22,240
lot to that question but as things get

93
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:24,009
more mainstream I envision larger scale

94
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,500
commercial farming

95
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:29,050
and that would be more outdoor in nature

96
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,720
due to the cost structure doesn't mean

97
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,270
that a lot of those craft growers are

98
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,340
going to be out of a job or out of the

99
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:38,519
business it's just I think that there

100
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:41,099
will be fewer of the craft growers

101
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:44,169
relative to the larger commercial ones

102
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,850
what is influencing those sort of

103
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,949
projects other what other things are

104
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,540
influencing production shifts in the US

105
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:51,219
and do you think there'll be some there

106
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,129
will be production divergence between

107
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:57,570
cannabis and hemp cannabis markets yeah

108
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:59,860
the what's driving a lot of this is cost

109
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:02,620
consumers are very cost-conscious

110
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,600
there's high levels of elasticity and

111
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,980
the demand meaning that consumers are

112
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:12,129
price sensitive and so so in that sense

113
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,290
if you have inexpensive cannabis then

114
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:16,389
consumers will gravitate towards it

115
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,640
that's why policy is really important

116
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:21,879
because if you have high taxation like

117
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,819
they do say here in California then it

118
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:28,750
may price the legal growers out of the

119
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:31,800
market so price is a determinant but

120
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:35,139
quality is as well what we're seeing is

121
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,750
you know indoor remains competitive

122
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:41,759
because of its the the nature of its

123
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:45,279
quality and its consistency we're seeing

124
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:49,230
imports from I mean interdictions from

125
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:53,049
Mexico and like going way down

126
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:54,460
considerably like 80 90 percent fewer

127
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,939
interdictions over the last four or five

128
00:05:54,459 --> 00:06:00,729
years and that's because the southern or

129
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:03,160
the the cannabis come in from Mexico and

130
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,259
and south of the border it can't compete

131
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,570
with quality so there's a quality aspect

132
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:11,409
and a pricing aspect which is driving

133
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:14,019
innovation into the marketplace you know

134
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,480
cannabis was an industry long before

135
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:17,629
prohibition Sears catalogs used to sell

136
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,680
it

137
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:24,199
one of the irony's of prohibition is

138
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,519
that it gave us a community as well a

139
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,319
movement how do you see large-scale

140
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:33,109
indoor production playing out against

141
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,939
the crafts market and will craft

142
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,150
cannabis continue to hold its place

143
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:40,969
within the industry and you know how can

144
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:44,569
those craft players strategize to retain

145
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,700
a substantial market share against big

146
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:48,889
businesses you know it's it's been

147
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,079
interesting because we study not only

148
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:53,060
the higher THC cannabis market but the

149
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:55,339
industrial side of the cannabis market

150
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,730
as well and we're seeing a little bit of

151
00:06:55,339 --> 00:07:02,599
a divergence just in that aspect there's

152
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:05,180
that on the hemp side there is large

153
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,240
commercial operations generating tens of

154
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,550
millions of pounds per year in biomass

155
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,800
and the smaller farmers cannot compete

156
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,230
with that in terms of price so what they

157
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,050
are doing and this is kind of in its

158
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:20,450
nascent stages they're teaming up with

159
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:24,230
their fellow farmers and communities and

160
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:26,319
forming coops and so the coop model is

161
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,980
rather prevalent in the hemp industry

162
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,659
whereas I think on the higher THC side

163
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:35,300
it's going to take a while for that part

164
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,550
of the market to develop but what's

165
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,560
interesting is that there like I said

166
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,319
earlier there's going to be a place for

167
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,360
both sides of the of the business that

168
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,459
commercial and the craft growers it's

169
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,680
just going to I think shift more heavily

170
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:54,459
towards the commercial side as this

171
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:58,879
market matures and as the regulations go

172
00:07:54,459 --> 00:08:01,609
more a national and international let's

173
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,050
move up north a little bit to Canada do

174
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,569
you think Canada will be a major

175
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,610
producer and is there a future for large

176
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:10,490
scale greenhouses in Ontario and and

177
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,960
alike well a lot of the licensed

178
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,660
producers or LPS

179
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:18,549
invested heavily in the Canadian markets

180
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:21,170
they got this war chest of money from

181
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,180
inflated stock prices and the like and

182
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:26,530
they've deployed that money to establish

183
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:29,389
these large commercial indoor grows

184
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:31,008
unfortunately they got a little bit too

185
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:33,168
far out over their skis

186
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:35,479
and there wasn't sufficient demand in

187
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:37,278
the Canadian market which is roughly the

188
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,860
size of the California market there

189
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:43,509
wasn't enough demand to satisfy all that

190
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:49,009
supply and in addition to that on the

191
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:54,198
you know in the Parliament and in Canada

192
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:56,809
they've set up some policies which have

193
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:59,208
limited the pace of the deployment of

194
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:03,888
the retail system so not only do you

195
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:06,799
have this large amount of supply or at

196
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:08,629
least supply capacity you don't have the

197
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,120
ability to get it into the consumers

198
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:14,419
hands and so that's exacerbated the

199
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,009
illicit market there was hope and I

200
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:18,889
think this was reflected in the stock

201
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:21,708
prices that the Canadians could

202
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:23,959
translate that large capacity into the

203
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:26,000
export market but that hasn't

204
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,708
materialized as much as people had

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,110
thought and as a result they're not

206
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,219
hitting their numbers the large license

207
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,528
producers are not hitting their numbers

208
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,690
like they thought they would there's

209
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:39,948
some barriers to entry say in the

210
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:42,019
European Union that which is the market

211
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:44,359
of choice for for those producers

212
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:47,659
there's been barriers to entry that were

213
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,519
unanticipated and it's influenced the

214
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:54,230
amount that could actually be exported

215
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,509
so are they going to be large players I

216
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,959
kind of doubt it

217
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:02,230
they had their run and it didn't go so

218
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,059
well but there's going to be other

219
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,850
countries that are going to supplant

220
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:10,099
them eventually there's still some time

221
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,089
in the Canadian market but I think their

222
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,509
time is running out

223
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:16,459
you mentioned stocks so let's kind of

224
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:18,649
touch over to that very quickly we've

225
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:21,439
seen a great deal of variability with

226
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:24,259
stock performance how has current market

227
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,699
volatility impacted the development

228
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:27,499
solid ation of the industry in north

229
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:31,008
america and what will it look like over

230
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:34,879
the next five years yeah the the access

231
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:37,188
to capital has been a major thorn in the

232
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,829
side of the development of the cannabis

233
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:43,009
industry in the United States not having

234
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:44,538
banking not having being heavily taxed

235
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:47,989
via 280e

236
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:50,479
it's really impacted the growth but what

237
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:53,679
it's also impacted is the ability to to

238
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:59,149
get financing to run your business and

239
00:10:53,678 --> 00:11:02,178
so as a result there's been as the as a

240
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:03,668
market it has expanded in the u.s. in

241
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:07,369
Illinois and Michigan and elsewhere

242
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:10,308
there's been more players requiring more

243
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:13,819
money but there's just hasn't been as

244
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:15,469
much money available now it doesn't mean

245
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:18,378
that there's no money out there but it's

246
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,399
just tougher to get so as growers as

247
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:24,079
operators people really need to be

248
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,538
cognizant of how competitive the the

249
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,578
financing market is and they need to put

250
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:30,708
their best foot forward in terms of

251
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:33,108
making the pitch to acquire that money

252
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:35,358
and we you know in our phone just kind

253
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:39,160
of a we talked a little bit how this

254
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:39,160
stock market can also drive innovation

255
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:46,069
yeah you know as as more and more

256
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:49,519
players enter into the space there's

257
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:51,950
been and as investors toggle between

258
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,929
their risk tolerance you know sometimes

259
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,730
it's riskier they'll do more on the

260
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:58,609
plant touching side and other aspects

261
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:02,060
it's you know if there's a change in

262
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:05,840
attorney general for example there may

263
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:07,639
be shifts in the risk tolerance of those

264
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,330
investors and so they may invest in the

265
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:14,000
infrastructure or the picks and shovels

266
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:16,400
and so that's because there's been that

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,620
toggling between plant touching and and

268
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,309
non plant touching investment it's

269
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:25,700
driven innovation even in that sense and

270
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:28,369
then also as the cost is a major factor

271
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:32,030
and profitability comes into play then

272
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:34,220
that's driving innovation as well areas

273
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:37,250
to reduce cost energy consumption

274
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,070
lighting air movement especially on the

275
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:42,080
indoor side you know all of this comes

276
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,210
into play and is driving that that type

277
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,120
of innovation and it's also driving

278
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:49,220
innovation on the propagation side you

279
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,370
know four or five years ago I never even

280
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,340
thought about stem cell propagation very

281
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,860
very low cost and that's a innovation

282
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:05,180
that was outside of the industry but has

283
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:07,700
since been brought in biomass production

284
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:11,120
for plant extraction and minor

285
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,640
cannabinoid isolates including CBD is a

286
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,639
rapidly expanding and competitive

287
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,189
commodity market how will supply and

288
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,990
demand influence where and how this area

289
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,150
of the industry develops over the next

290
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:27,620
five years yeah you know on the

291
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:29,959
industrial side of things with the farm

292
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,870
bill that was passed in 2018 a lot of

293
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,060
people jumped into the market the number

294
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:38,120
of acres license for example increased

295
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:41,869
over 400% it went from roughly a hundred

296
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,820
thousand acres license to five hundred

297
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:47,149
thousand acres right and so a lot of

298
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:49,010
people got in thinking that they were

299
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:50,720
just going to get rich and everybody was

300
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:53,120
going to be doing CBD and all this stuff

301
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,600
yeah and that wasn't the case we

302
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,919
because there was a lot of

303
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,100
infrastructural and supply chain issues

304
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,719
that people didn't anticipate it

305
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,759
anticipate when they jumped in and so

306
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,440
the supply chain has really limited the

307
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,139
growth and development of the industrial

308
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,540
hemp market now that's starting to

309
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:14,629
change but it's gonna take a lot of time

310
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:18,259
it's going to take years and not months

311
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:21,289
for example and processing seems to be

312
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:24,019
the biggest bottleneck in the entire

313
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:26,240
supply chain there's a lot of demand out

314
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:27,769
there and so there's been talks of

315
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,230
oversupply

316
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:32,389
there's just oversupply relative to the

317
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,730
capacity for the processors to process

318
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:37,429
it it's not over necessarily in my

319
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,550
opinion it's not necessarily over supply

320
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:42,079
relative to the demand you've got large

321
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:45,588
cosmetic manufacturers you've got large

322
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,420
beverage providers that are just waiting

323
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:50,270
in the wings doing their product

324
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:52,278
development but they just don't trust

325
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:53,929
supply chain yet and so that's

326
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:56,210
inhibiting the growth the demands

327
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:58,639
they're just not enough supply making it

328
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:02,060
into the market where will it be in five

329
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:05,028
years I think certainly those supply

330
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:08,000
chain issues in terms of not only

331
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:10,429
processing but packaging transportation

332
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,159
storage drawing all of that on the

333
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:15,409
biomass side and the industrial side

334
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:18,379
will have a place in the market and

335
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:22,730
there's I think the the opportunity for

336
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:26,000
industrial hemp is far larger than the

337
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:28,278
higher THC side of cannabis because

338
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,470
there's more product offerings and

339
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:33,500
product capabilities fiber side

340
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:36,259
everybody talks about CBD because it's

341
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,919
sexy but there's bio plastics there's

342
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:41,059
food products there's you know

343
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:43,338
industrial applications that people

344
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:46,189
really aren't talking about but I think

345
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:48,630
that is the next wave of the industrial

346
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:52,560
side of cannabis especially how that

347
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:55,559
I think revitalize rural communities to

348
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,899
the idea that where you could have hemp

349
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:00,809
farming and industrial production and

350
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:03,299
manufacturing within the same town and

351
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:06,329
allow this those communities to grow

352
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:08,490
again I'm really excited about that yeah

353
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:13,550
you know that's where that whole coop

354
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:17,360
concept comes into play because large

355
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:20,189
consumers of isolate or dis lit on the

356
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,830
CPG side they're looking for consistency

357
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:24,990
in their product offerings and their

358
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:27,780
product inputs the raw material inputs

359
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:31,970
and so communities have the opportunity

360
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:35,279
to sync up plant the same strain

361
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:38,940
harmonized on their production capacity

362
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:41,039
and their capabilities and then cobble

363
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:45,000
together enough supply to satisfy these

364
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:48,149
large large actors in the space let's go

365
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,480
back to the sort of global idea in

366
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:52,829
equatorial regions outside of the US and

367
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,500
North America

368
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,620
well outdoor and greenhouse biomass

369
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,330
production be a competitive force

370
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:08,039
against indoor giants in cooler climates

371
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:11,279
and how the discussions so I think that

372
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:13,588
debate is still going to occur with

373
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,318
respect to producing cannabis in

374
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:18,588
tropical areas because of the moisture

375
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,838
content and humidity and so there's

376
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:24,750
issues associated with mold and and

377
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:29,659
other things that need to be addressed

378
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:33,960
and there's not a whole lot of seeds or

379
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:37,080
genomes let's say that are that thrive

380
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,720
in tropical regions and so there's large

381
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:44,039
opportunities for for those that can

382
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:46,620
supply into those areas however one

383
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:50,759
thing that was I mentioned earlier that

384
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:52,949
we were in Zimbabwe and we talked to the

385
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:55,379
government about deploying a hemp

386
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,350
program there and and kind of outlined

387
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,470
jobs and economic development and and

388
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:02,569
the benefits and they started a program

389
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,120
just recently

390
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:07,548
what they didn't realize is that because

391
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,989
of their proximity relative to the

392
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:11,480
equator

393
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:14,778
the plants grew faster and they matured

394
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,298
quicker and they had a greater faster

395
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:19,308
time-to-market and so there was a

396
00:18:17,298 --> 00:18:21,648
competitive advantage that they didn't

397
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:23,210
even realize that they had as a result

398
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:25,308
of that they had to adjust their

399
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:29,389
propagation strategies and their

400
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:31,668
cultivation operations and like to

401
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:33,979
adjust for that but they were pleasantly

402
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:37,070
surprised and so I think that is one

403
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:41,028
thing that we'll see as more and more

404
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:44,538
global cannabis cultivation occurs and

405
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:48,829
there are players like in Thailand and

406
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:52,339
Laos that are looking at establishing a

407
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:56,569
foothold for to supply into Asia and so

408
00:18:52,339 --> 00:19:00,579
and they have low inputs from a cost

409
00:18:56,569 --> 00:19:03,138
perspective and so they may be able to

410
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:06,859
take a lot of the market share that the

411
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:09,918
the colder climate cultivators currently

412
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:12,319
have and you know once we start to see a

413
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,840
global market expanding global market

414
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:19,398
the idea that we could actually start to

415
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:20,309
cultivate chemo VARs in their land race

416
00:19:19,398 --> 00:19:21,809
and fire

417
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:25,079
and being able to have that

418
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:26,909
specialization it's very exciting yeah I

419
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,879
mean that in that sense the

420
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:32,610
opportunities are really unlimited now

421
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,520
over 80 countries have some form of

422
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:39,659
cannabis legalization either for CBD for

423
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:42,930
medical for industrial hemp so yeah and

424
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:46,529
so the US market in that sense is

425
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:49,920
actually behind and they need to catch

426
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:53,549
up in order to remain competitive in the

427
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,890
global marketplace how the discussions

428
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:58,169
around climate change and industry

429
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:01,770
sustainability influence sourcing

430
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:04,380
outcomes you know I think on the on the

431
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:06,690
climate change side of things what it's

432
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,910
driving is the conversation and

433
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:14,130
education and that's a really good thing

434
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:17,330
to do the education about how you know

435
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:20,760
what the carbon footprint is what the

436
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:23,699
impact of water consumption use of

437
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:26,819
pesticides in the environment I think

438
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,700
all of that is good to analyze and study

439
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:32,519
and educate people what we're also

440
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:37,170
seeing is that it's changing the

441
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:40,829
behavior of investors and for those that

442
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:42,779
have a brand that highlight their lack

443
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:45,629
of environmental impact let's say and

444
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:47,369
their considerations for you know

445
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,830
climate change and like those are

446
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:52,739
differentiating factors that are good

447
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:55,649
for a brand that they can promote you

448
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:59,069
know in the future we're also seeing on

449
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:02,880
the investment side that and this is

450
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:05,279
similar for wine growers as well they're

451
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,820
competing for the same land and they're

452
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,710
chasing land opportunities north so for

453
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:14,279
example some of the Napa Valley growers

454
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:16,259
of grapes are moving into Southern

455
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:20,160
Oregon and competing for Southern Oregon

456
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:22,680
land and so it's increasing the property

457
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,779
valuations as a result so there's a lot

458
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:29,400
of movement and a lot of influence that

459
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:30,789
that climate change has had on the

460
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:36,030
industry as a whole

461
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:39,009
as a you know an industry in its infancy

462
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:42,490
the cannabis industry has the

463
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:47,730
opportunity to really take hold of

464
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:52,180
sustainability and innovation and and

465
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:54,460
present a model a standard of best

466
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,830
practices for other environments we have

467
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,049
people here today obviously that aren't

468
00:21:56,829 --> 00:22:00,909
just in the cannabis industry how do you

469
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:02,559
think how do you see that playing out

470
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:04,810
over the next five years that sort of

471
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,559
interaction between the cannabis

472
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:12,819
industry and and and other agriculture

473
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:16,329
well um you know I think that in driving

474
00:22:12,819 --> 00:22:19,359
of the innovation a lot of this has come

475
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:22,960
from within the industry and so that's

476
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:25,779
been a good thing and I think that over

477
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,600
time this will expand because for the

478
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:31,599
longest time the community was you know

479
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:33,730
very secretive and because of the

480
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:37,000
illicit nature of it so there wasn't as

481
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:39,069
much mine share that has occurred that

482
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,710
it didn't occur previously and it's

483
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:43,960
starting to occur now so now that people

484
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,740
are talking they're sharing best

485
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,569
practices and the like and as a result

486
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,819
you know there's a greater push towards

487
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:55,619
sustainability just because it's in the

488
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:58,089
conversations and then I'm not sure if

489
00:22:55,619 --> 00:23:01,239
cannabis has gotten the respect that

490
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:05,919
it's due in terms of the maturity of the

491
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:08,440
market the generations of effort that

492
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,300
people have put into it and so there's

493
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,029
not as much of a push from the outside

494
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:14,799
on the sustainability side as there is

495
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:17,369
from the inside pushing out it's

496
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,369
unfortunate

497
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:24,529
if we do it right what are you seeing

498
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:27,019
now in terms of cannabis and hemp hemp

499
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:31,879
cannabis commodity product the product

500
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:35,990
prices fluctuation yeah so on the higher

501
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,970
THC side as markets mature and you get

502
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:42,069
more cultivation than prices just

503
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:45,140
naturally go down on the industrial side

504
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:48,740
it was a buyers market this last harvest

505
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:51,290
meaning that the processors had the

506
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:54,259
upper hand because there was limited

507
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:57,619
capacity and as such they were able to

508
00:23:54,259 --> 00:24:00,259
drive the price down and I didn't

509
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:02,419
necessarily see a bottom I thought that

510
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:05,599
there might be but I saw some quotes out

511
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:08,690
there at at 40 cents or 60 cents per

512
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:11,000
percent of CBD for hemp biomass which is

513
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:16,880
just shocking considering just a year

514
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,289
ago as it was approaching $4 and so one

515
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,030
thing to consider though is that

516
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:23,480
although it's a highly competitive

517
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:27,950
market in the u.s. both for industrial

518
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:30,640
and for higher THC cannabis people need

519
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:34,160
to keep a watchful eye on the

520
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,770
international development because those

521
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,750
people that are looking at the Thailand

522
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:41,180
market they want to drive their

523
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:45,349
production costs down to less than a

524
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:47,390
penny a gram talking about competing

525
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:48,558
with you know talking about cannabis is

526
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,470
medicine you know if

527
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:53,148
10 cent per pill ibuprofen you know how

528
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,069
do we get to that point what what kind

529
00:24:53,148 --> 00:24:57,109
of price what do we need to get to with

530
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:59,298
commodities with him commodities to be

531
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:00,709
able to actually compete against like

532
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:05,298
pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter

533
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:07,929
drugs yeah so as the prices go down on a

534
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:10,839
global basis then that will benefit

535
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:13,850
those folks that need it most the the

536
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:16,490
medicinal patients that don't have the

537
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:18,980
means in which to acquire their their

538
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,690
medicine and so I see that as a good

539
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,569
thing it just makes it challenging from

540
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:27,940
a business perspective in that interim

541
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:33,288
period oh and one other thing is that

542
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:37,220
not only is the cannabis cultivation you

543
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:40,609
know expanding globally and driving the

544
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,589
competitive nature and you know on the

545
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:45,339
global side other countries are an

546
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:48,558
existential threat but keep in mind that

547
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:51,259
the pharmaceutical companies aren't

548
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,329
necessarily standing idle and so they're

549
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:55,878
creating products and doing more

550
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:59,388
research and so they're just as much as

551
00:25:55,878 --> 00:26:01,428
an existential threat then you know just

552
00:25:59,388 --> 00:26:07,248
the global marketplace and here's an

553
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:10,278
example so in 2017 the CBD market was

554
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:14,269
roughly a seven eight hundred million

555
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:16,759
dollar market in the US and half of the

556
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:20,329
CBD was supplied by the marijuana side

557
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:24,079
half of it was supplied by the hem fast

558
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:28,609
forward just into 2019 now a full third

559
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:31,069
of the market is supplied from GW Pharma

560
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:33,168
and so you know so there's that

561
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:34,999
existential threat that's occurred that

562
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:39,019
people weren't necessarily anticipating

563
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:41,179
even two or three or four years ago that

564
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:45,999
being said you know I think we've seen a

565
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:48,080
shift away from people's trust in

566
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:52,069
pharmaceuticals especially after the

567
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:56,868
opioid crisis how well cultural paradigm

568
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:59,148
shifts like increased interest in local

569
00:26:56,868 --> 00:27:00,709
and organic so we're seeing an

570
00:26:59,148 --> 00:27:03,199
alternative medicine in the wake of the

571
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:05,419
opioid crisis influenced the future of

572
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,659
the cannabis and how cannabis market so

573
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:10,940
I think that that will play a large role

574
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:13,730
because we've done at new frontier data

575
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:17,808
we've done a lot of surveys not only in

576
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:20,778
the US but globally and we're about to

577
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:24,859
come out with some results on the EU CBD

578
00:27:20,778 --> 00:27:27,740
studies and the u.s. CBD surveys and

579
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:29,689
what we're seeing not to steal any

580
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,269
headlines here but what we're seeing is

581
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:36,558
that people while they don't necessarily

582
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:39,589
want pharmaceutical you know drugs and

583
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:43,220
supply they trust it from a safety

584
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:45,949
perspective and so until the point comes

585
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,470
where the cannabis market can

586
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:51,259
demonstrate that there's you know safe

587
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:53,089
consistent supply dosage

588
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:56,538
you know that's consistent on a delivery

589
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:59,509
mechanism that people trust then there's

590
00:27:56,538 --> 00:28:02,839
always going to be that that stigma

591
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:05,659
attached from a safety perspective but

592
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:07,878
once they can overcome that then it's

593
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:09,799
very very viable that they can steal a

594
00:28:07,878 --> 00:28:12,859
lot of market share away from the

595
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:14,690
pharmaceutical on demand

596
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:17,678
possibility of any sort of you know

597
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:21,200
policy shift that would allow you know

598
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:25,370
pharmaceutical research and you know

599
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:28,220
craft and industry growers to to all

600
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:30,558
have a little piece of the pie there's a

601
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:36,039
lot of discussion on on these very

602
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:40,609
topics reform for veterans they allow

603
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:42,859
allowing for research and in fact we

604
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:46,009
just help prep some folks for some

605
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:49,609
congressional testimony for next week in

606
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:52,779
DC and they're really pushing for the

607
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:57,259
ability to do research the ability to do

608
00:28:52,779 --> 00:29:00,589
to allow veterans access to you know in

609
00:28:57,259 --> 00:29:02,419
order to move this along just recently I

610
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:06,079
spoke in Portland Oregon at the Oregon

611
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:08,059
Health Sciences University it was a the

612
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:11,000
topic was you know the benefits of

613
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:13,480
cannabis on the human body and there's

614
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,130
not a whole lot of research out there

615
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:20,599
except for some good work being done and

616
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:23,870
say Israel or Canada and like but a lot

617
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:27,259
of the doctors there that had done some

618
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:29,629
research showed that there was an impact

619
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:34,129
on the human body but it just needed

620
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:36,110
more research in order to fully vet it

621
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,510
out to see what's an appropriate dosage

622
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:41,298
what impact does it have on spasticity

623
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:44,750
on pain management and you know

624
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:47,450
childhood epilepsy and life so it's just

625
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,669
there's going to be more research done

626
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:53,600
and there's a push a lot of discussions

627
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:57,020
at the federal level it's just it's

628
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:59,579
unfortunately just taking some time the

629
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:01,740
last few minutes before we move to

630
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:03,869
I know you have been interested in

631
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,370
talking about intentionality and I'd

632
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:09,569
like to give you a little time to kind

633
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:11,879
of go into that yeah you know it's a lot

634
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:17,250
of the in the research that we've done

635
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:20,970
there's there's the concept of intent

636
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:25,259
that's coming up a lot farmers in France

637
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:26,940
for example growing industrial cannabis

638
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:30,240
with the intention of supplying a

639
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:33,930
specific market farmers in the Midwest

640
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,049
for example that are coming together to

641
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:41,340
grow a specific crop for fiber or for a

642
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:44,460
specific product that intentionality has

643
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:46,109
been just it's been coming up a lot but

644
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,860
in addition there's been people that

645
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:52,409
have jumped into this market that want

646
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:55,139
to do good things for good people and so

647
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:58,230
that intention also has been really

648
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:02,090
resonant with me personally as well as

649
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:05,519
with others because it just promotes

650
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:11,009
goodness in a world right now where that

651
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:12,750
can be considered a challenge is there

652
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:15,180
anything else that you'd like to add

653
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:18,240
that we haven't covered today no I think

654
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:21,000
that just a couple of closing thoughts

655
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,700
there's right now it's roughly a

656
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,960
thirteen billion dollar legal market and

657
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:30,480
it's growing for a higher THC just alone

658
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,039
and that's just in the United States but

659
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,200
it's really a seventy billion dollar

660
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:36,269
market if you look at the illicit

661
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,220
activity and the illicit distribution

662
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:41,400
channels so there's a tremendous

663
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,890
opportunity for those that get in here

664
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,150
still if they have a good value

665
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:48,180
proposition then they can get some money

666
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:51,300
right but there's this tremendous

667
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,950
opportunity still now based upon some

668
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:55,139
research that we did last year the

669
00:31:52,950 --> 00:32:00,509
Global Markets a 350 billion dollar

670
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:03,060
market and 230 million consumers

671
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:07,740
globally I'm just a higher THC cannabis

672
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:10,859
so there's a market out there that is

673
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,339
relatively untapped and for those people

674
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:15,490
that have the vision

675
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:17,500
have the ability have the mindset you

676
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,390
know the sky is really the limit it's

677
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,059
very very exciting it's still in its

678
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:24,310
nascent stages and that's what really

679
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:28,500
gets me going in the morning and I don't

680
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:28,500
want to close my computer down at night

681
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:46,000
so the question was the GW Pharma number

682
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:52,000
we had forecasted that in 2019 they add

683
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:54,910
about a third of the the u.s. CBD market

684
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,599
share the other equally distributed

685
00:32:54,910 --> 00:33:05,410
distributed between higher THC cannabis

686
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:08,649
and industrial cannabis they are the

687
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:11,250
only CBD pharmaceutical on the market

688
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:15,640
everything else is within the industry

689
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:17,740
so you know as far as the the ability of

690
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,250
doctors to prescribe any sort of

691
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:23,470
cannabis outside of a medical program

692
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:25,660
that really is the only option beyond

693
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,339
you know your drew Nabin all's and says

694
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:33,580
Mets and such that we're from like the

695
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:36,519
1980s where THC like compounds forgive

696
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:39,609
me if this came up already but have you

697
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:44,319
spoken about the size of the home grow

698
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:46,869
sector and how that would impact the

699
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:50,829
overall market and the future of home

700
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:53,679
grow in the canvas yeah so the question

701
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:56,559
is about regarding home grow and the

702
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:59,200
percentage of the market in our analysis

703
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:02,349
we've only seen maybe 2 or 3 percent of

704
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,870
the total production is based in home

705
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:07,659
grow so it doesn't really necessarily

706
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:10,449
move the needle as much as large-scale

707
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:18,220
commercial operations outdoor production

708
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:22,589
and like going forward it's it's really

709
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:26,289
tough to say in in my opinion though

710
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:28,660
when you can buy Tomatoes

711
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:31,900
at the grocery store versus growing them

712
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:34,839
that's kind of the analogy I make and so

713
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:38,500
people want to dabble into the home

714
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,600
cultivation side but I I'm not

715
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:44,559
anticipating that everybody will stick

716
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:48,549
to it in the long run I think that's an

717
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:51,699
excellent question I do think it is very

718
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:56,320
important moving forward that as new

719
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:58,960
states come online they allow people to

720
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,730
grow at home I mean it is it is not

721
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,800
going to be everybody's cup of tea not

722
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:05,440
everybody is going to have a garden full

723
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,310
in the backyard but for the people who

724
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,740
need large quantities who want to make

725
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:13,389
sure they know how it's sourced to find

726
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:16,839
a team of are that they really like and

727
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:18,250
want to keep it going who you know want

728
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,670
to have control over their own medicine

729
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:23,829
that has to be a priority and I don't

730
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:25,180
think it's you know just as my own

731
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:28,059
personal opinion and I'm not an

732
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:30,069
economist but I don't think it's going

733
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:33,009
to compete with the market as a whole

734
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:34,990
you know people still want something you

735
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,790
know that they can their grocery stores

736
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:40,419
still exist even though Gardens you know

737
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:42,460
people are growing gardens but I think

738
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:47,260
it's extremely important that that is in

739
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:48,880
place in every single state all right

740
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,500
thanks for the presentation my name is

741
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,470
Erica Matos and with the greenhouse

742
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,840
lighting consortium my question is

743
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:58,299
regarding market where the market is

744
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,950
going we got questions sometimes people

745
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,370
asking with the legalization here in

746
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:04,960
u.s. coming up on these states

747
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:08,409
eventually getting national legalization

748
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,090
where the cultivation going to go we

749
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:11,469
work with lighting so my question is has

750
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:13,870
this we're trying to see that the

751
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:15,399
lighting market so the the final

752
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:17,500
question is if it gets legalized

753
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,510
everywhere do you think the coat evasion

754
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,369
going to go to clean houses they're

755
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,200
going to go outdoors and would they move

756
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:25,569
to the southern states or you have a lot

757
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,399
of lighting or are they going to go up

758
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:29,620
north and going with the controlled

759
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,750
environmental agriculture set up so

760
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:37,210
those market trends is that possible to

761
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:40,510
do in estimative and gases well the the

762
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:43,900
longevity of the indoor market

763
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:48,520
we'll be determined by the federal

764
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:52,000
regulators because right now each state

765
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:55,960
has to set up their own closed system in

766
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,960
order to legalize and cultivate and

767
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,420
distribute cannabis and so that's great

768
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,789
for suppliers of the picks and shovels

769
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:06,010
into the market because you have to set

770
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:08,829
up a new market in every state that

771
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:12,220
legalizes now there are some there's a

772
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:14,259
push to allow for exports out of states

773
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:16,889
that have a competitive advantage such

774
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:22,260
as California Oregon Washington Colorado

775
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:26,529
and so if that push to allow for exports

776
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:29,800
occurs and comes to fruition then that

777
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:32,019
could be a threat to the size of the

778
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,830
opportunity for green house suppliers

779
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:40,030
for indoor lighting and HVAC and the

780
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:41,920
like so in the short run over the next

781
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:45,519
few years definitely a strong

782
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,139
opportunity for suppliers that support

783
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:52,300
the indoor and green house grow

784
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:56,049
operations well we talked to a lot of

785
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:58,630
craft artists and cultivators whether no

786
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:02,170
matter how they're growing and as in the

787
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:06,400
northern region they look to the

788
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:08,820
development of Appalachian as as

789
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,860
something that will really help them

790
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:15,760
survive what do you think that role will

791
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:21,099
be and other things like that that might

792
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:24,670
help support crop growers so one of the

793
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:27,809
negatives about large scale cultivation

794
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:31,630
is that it limits the amount of

795
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:33,219
different varietals in this space and so

796
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:35,650
that's why I appreciated your answer on

797
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:39,069
home grows is because you'll have that

798
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:42,910
different varietal that's that works

799
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:44,490
well with that individual person now as

800
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:49,649
I see it in the future

801
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:52,839
there'll be a VA or aviary zones where

802
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:53,358
growers will grow in specific regions of

803
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,950
the country

804
00:38:53,358 --> 00:39:00,708
with specific soil composition and

805
00:38:56,949 --> 00:39:04,068
humidity and climate and they'll be

806
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:05,208
known for those limited productions and

807
00:39:04,068 --> 00:39:08,440
so I think that there's great

808
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:12,318
opportunity for small-scale production

809
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:14,749
of that nature it's it's similar to wine

810
00:39:12,318 --> 00:39:17,509
right you grow a particular varietal of

811
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:19,699
of grape and then it's limited run

812
00:39:17,509 --> 00:39:22,998
because you have limited space in which

813
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:27,889
to grow I think that is very very viable

814
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:30,828
in the future now with respect to the

815
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:32,179
Appalachia region I was in recently in

816
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:37,839
Tennessee and Kentucky

817
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:46,248
Oh appellees all right sorry

818
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:49,088
and so um no with so um no I just the I

819
00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:52,338
think there'll be specific zones that

820
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:55,278
will be known there'll be destinations

821
00:39:52,338 --> 00:39:59,298
you'll set up Kanna tourism you'll come

822
00:39:55,278 --> 00:40:02,748
to that vineyard model and and I think

823
00:39:59,298 --> 00:40:06,798
that's definitely viable for a lot of

824
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:08,868
the states that can grow appreciate you

825
00:40:06,798 --> 00:40:10,099
mentioning a can of tourism and maybe

826
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:12,440
you could just talk a little bit more

827
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:16,088
about that as a cannabis policy

828
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:19,608
professional I recognize that we are

829
00:40:16,088 --> 00:40:22,159
have have a huge lack of license types

830
00:40:19,608 --> 00:40:23,958
that encourage the tourism side of the

831
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,108
business and it ends up being just yet

832
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:30,318
another piece of the underground market

833
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:31,909
for cannabis but maybe anything that

834
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:34,699
you've seen or what you might expect to

835
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:39,708
happen around cannabis tourism so on the

836
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:44,170
canna tourism side what we saw in our in

837
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:48,558
our numbers in the forecast is that

838
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:52,729
there is this can of tourism effect we

839
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:56,028
saw it heavily in Nevada because people

840
00:40:52,728 --> 00:40:59,328
come into Nevada they go to Las Vegas

841
00:40:56,028 --> 00:41:01,818
they have their fun over a weekend and

842
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:03,680
we predicted

843
00:41:01,818 --> 00:41:06,409
you know what the surgeon demand would

844
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:06,980
be relative to the to the canna tourism

845
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:09,920
you

846
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:12,679
Nevada but we underestimated it because

847
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,780
what people do is they they buy way more

848
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:19,219
than they could possibly consume over

849
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:21,830
that weekend in Las Vegas and but there

850
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:23,599
is an effect of Kanna tourism from you

851
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:27,190
know into Oregon in a California and

852
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:30,949
like even in the Northeast with

853
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:34,309
Massachusetts and going up into the New

854
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:37,819
England area and there's a viable market

855
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:39,829
there the viability though will be

856
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,590
determined by the regulators in those

857
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:44,779
states because they can have a major

858
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:47,230
influence on setting up policies that

859
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:49,910
are favorable for Canada tourism or not

860
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:53,119
and then also social consumption is

861
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:56,750
another issue that is on the forefront

862
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,750
right now and so there's there are these

863
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,550
pushes in Colorado and Oregon and

864
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:05,059
elsewhere to allow for social

865
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:07,100
consumption but it's kind of lower on

866
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:11,119
the priority list than some of the other

867
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:13,608
things like export like supply and

868
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,858
demand and balancing licenses and like

869
00:42:13,608 --> 00:42:18,380
so it's not quite it hasn't quite

870
00:42:15,858 --> 00:42:21,380
percolated up yet to be one of those

871
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,960
issues that will coalesce with the

872
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:26,539
policymakers and and will succeed

873
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,250
through the legislative process but it's

874
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:29,989
a huge industry

875
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:34,639
it's just relatively untapped right now

876
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:38,739
I think that's it we're doing a great

877
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,739
job thank you very much thanks

878
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:44,339
[Applause]
