1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,699
I want to say about six seven years ago

2
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:19,920
I started covering cannabis at the

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,010
street I used to work at the street comm

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,449
with some Kramer and I started covering

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,000
cannabis back then so I've really been

6
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,368
covering it for quite some time now

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,730
one of the things that I you know will

8
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:33,929
kick off right now is legislation one of

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,789
the things I had heard from one of my

10
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:37,369
sources was that they thought that this

11
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:41,369
administration was going to reschedule

12
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:43,199
cannabis to level three and I had heard

13
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:44,369
that was first quarter but I don't I

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,920
think now what the government shut down

15
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:49,619
that's off the table but some of the

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,198
people I talked to about schedule three

17
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,759
said that they really did not want that

18
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,890
and I want to kind of put that to the

19
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,909
panel have you guys heard that about

20
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:03,149
Washington bringing it down to a three

21
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:06,000
and if so have you heard anything else

22
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,939
and what have you heard and what is your

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,099
thought on that well I have heard that

24
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,289
and I would agree with the naysayers I

25
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,868
do not think it's a good idea I think it

26
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,580
will lead to a lot of confusion and I

27
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:20,640
say that because if it goes to level

28
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:23,789
three then presumably you would need a

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,400
prescription at a pharmacy prescribed by

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,070
you know position to purchase marijuana

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,978
and it's really unclear as to what it

32
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:33,658
would do for the recreational use market

33
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:35,879
and I'm gonna add to it like like

34
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,359
everybody believes that there needs to

35
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,879
be cannabis reform federally there's a

36
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,859
lot of folks who get charged with crimes

37
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,769
who are in prison for cannabis related

38
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,989
crimes and that needs to change but

39
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:52,170
regardless of what like the federal

40
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:55,078
government does it's it's puts you on a

41
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,960
pathway to lose-lose because right now

42
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:00,389
the federal government prohibition is

43
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,809
the only thing keeping out the bigs if

44
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,640
you turn it over to Schedule three

45
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,489
you're then regulated medically by the

46
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,580
FDA which which means the cannabis

47
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,509
industry is being gift-wrapped for big

48
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,010
pharma because every

49
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,840
product that's developed is gonna have

50
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:19,030
to go through clinical trials it's gonna

51
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,219
have to go through FDA approval to show

52
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,579
that it's effective and safe for human

53
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:26,469
use alternatively the other option is to

54
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:28,659
turn it over its 2d schedule it

55
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:31,120
completely take it away from the FDA and

56
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:34,689
say we're gonna give this to ATF and

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,060
regulate it like tobacco and alcohol the

58
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:39,519
problem there is you're opening it up

59
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,469
for all the big tobacco companies you're

60
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,150
opening it up for all the big alcohol

61
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:44,199
companies and and we've seen that

62
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,849
they're excited to do it

63
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,459
all of them are making investments in

64
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:51,310
Canada right now and and you know

65
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:53,500
developing a cannabis related product so

66
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,199
it's it's tough it's a really tough

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,930
situation to be in right now because of

68
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,179
the federal prohibition we have this

69
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,950
really neat little industry where like

70
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,370
regular people are building up

71
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:08,738
businesses regular folks are elevating

72
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,209
their status in life for their families

73
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:12,489
and and for the folks around them

74
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:15,759
there's all these new jobs without the

75
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,079
bigs coming in and so any sort of change

76
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,750
that's how and I don't have the answer

77
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:21,579
here it's a policy decision but any sort

78
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,310
of change at the federal level whether

79
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:27,099
it's putting it at you know schedule 3 4

80
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,530
5 or D scheduling it completely and

81
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:32,048
turning it over to the states it's going

82
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,269
to invite the big boys in and it's going

83
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:36,129
to make it much harder for the regular

84
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:38,349
folks who are trying to run a cannabis

85
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:42,039
business to continue what they have

86
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:44,828
going well and that maybe is that the

87
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:47,259
issue is if people that are within the

88
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:50,290
industry can't agree on the correct

89
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:52,418
solution it's kind of hard to expect our

90
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:54,489
regulators dinner and our politicians

91
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:57,189
and legislators to figure out what is

92
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:59,408
the best solution and I agree with you

93
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:02,949
and at least for the industry itself

94
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:05,530
it's going to provide the industry so

95
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:07,659
much more flexibility and freedom if

96
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,459
it's D scheduled completely because

97
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:11,168
turning it over to skit two Schedule

98
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,449
three or any sort of schedule

99
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:15,159
leaves it within the medical realm and

100
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:17,379
the cost of getting a product approved

101
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:19,988
by the FDA it's going to be you know

102
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:22,209
cost prohibitive for 99% of folks out

103
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,379
there so at least if it's D scheduled

104
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:26,729
you know you look at the alcohol

105
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:28,649
industry as a model or something

106
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,420
for comparison you do have small

107
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:32,579
providers you do have like craft

108
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,740
breweries and and craft producers who

109
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:37,259
are doing things on the small level it

110
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,329
also will just invite you know Budweiser

111
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,969
and the big players to completely

112
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:44,250
dominate the industry on a national

113
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,870
level but but from my perspective Dee

114
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,209
scheduling seems to be the better

115
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,699
solution for the industry rather than

116
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:53,159
just moving it to schedule 3 because

117
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,740
then you're just pigeon holed into that

118
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,740
medical box and everything will have to

119
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,389
go through FDA approval in order to be

120
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,340
on the market and then EDD will have

121
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:08,849
like nothing in his database anymore

122
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:11,369
because they'll be like conferences we

123
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,340
went to when the key notice said exactly

124
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,170
what Erin said which was we benefit by

125
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:18,060
having the state regular regulatory

126
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,189
framework for now and because it's gonna

127
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,079
allow a lot of companies to be

128
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:25,680
innovative to try things and not be

129
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:29,069
beholden to one regulator to have so

130
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,139
much power so so yeah I would agree and

131
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:32,819
the comp the amount of capital that has

132
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,039
poured into the industry I mean what

133
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,779
happens to all these investments I mean

134
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,850
all of a sudden then you can't sell what

135
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,489
you've been selling I mean it just

136
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,129
doesn't make any sense so I don't think

137
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,949
it's gonna happen personally so let's

138
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:48,920
drill down then into our local area of

139
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:52,469
New York in New Jersey which are both

140
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,449
getting close to having legislation on

141
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:59,100
the books as we know Massachusetts just

142
00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:01,079
started their adult use they had two

143
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,120
dispensaries open on the first day what

144
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:07,199
are they up to now five I think they're

145
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,480
up to about five they've had some my

146
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,620
massachusetts researcher said they're

147
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,060
opening on the borders of the

148
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,569
neighboring states ones very close to

149
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,459
New York

150
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,139
one's very close to Rhode Island like I

151
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:18,599
think he said literally a stone's throw

152
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,759
into Rhode Island you could hit it so

153
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,860
and and really you know I think that

154
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,539
that's the the key I had spoken to a

155
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,270
politician in New Hampshire who called

156
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:31,020
me and asked me you know just was doing

157
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:32,759
some you know research and asked me what

158
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:34,859
I thought and I said you know here's the

159
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,009
thing you know if you guys decide to

160
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,930
stick your head in this hand and say no

161
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,468
all the states around you are going to

162
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,408
give job

163
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:45,689
to their residents they're going to have

164
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:47,278
dispensaries in their states and all the

165
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:49,169
tax money is going to go to all your

166
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:51,658
neighbors and you're gonna be left

167
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:54,149
empty-handed and I feel like that's

168
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:55,800
almost like what Cuomo realized was holy

169
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:57,389
crap you know New Jersey and

170
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,788
Massachusetts are going to get all the

171
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:01,379
jobs and all that tax money and we're

172
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:04,110
gonna be left empty-handed plus he

173
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:07,499
finally had his group and all beneath it

174
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:10,050
that we're clearly going to move forward

175
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:12,499
what what did where are we at with New

176
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,598
Jersey because we know New Jersey's

177
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:18,139
governor was pushing for it and then

178
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,579
things seemed to really slow down I

179
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:23,038
think it's still obviously still on the

180
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:25,019
table in terms of you know how when when

181
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,899
it's going to advance you know my guess

182
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:30,088
is this year and probably sometime in

183
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,379
this first quarter well I think the

184
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:34,110
other interesting thing about New Jersey

185
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:36,509
- and is Debra's reported we've seen a

186
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,999
lot of the multi state operators come

187
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:41,129
into that state which changes the tenor

188
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:42,838
of what licensing is like when you only

189
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:45,149
have a handful of licenses and it's

190
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:46,588
competitive and suddenly these people

191
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:48,838
who have been successful in running

192
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:51,269
operations in other states come into

193
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:53,639
your state it's gonna change the tenor

194
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:56,218
because the other data that you can

195
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,869
research is who's paid the lobbyists and

196
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:59,759
you often see that there's a connection

197
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:02,669
there so I think it is gonna have an

198
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,679
impact and we'll see how plays out yeah

199
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:06,329
I know in New Jersey that that was a big

200
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:09,688
concern was people wanted to make sure

201
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:11,968
that the small guy the small player had

202
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:15,838
a chance to get into the New Jersey

203
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:17,728
market and I think we saw a couple of

204
00:08:15,838 --> 00:08:19,439
things we saw some of the small players

205
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:23,308
get these licenses and then flip them

206
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:25,259
and look I kind of don't blame them if

207
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:26,759
you spent like two million dollars or

208
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:29,098
whatever four million dollars trying to

209
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,929
get a license which still is a lot of

210
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:32,188
money but then somebody walks up to you

211
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:35,399
and says hey I'll give you 20 million

212
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:37,828
for that license you'd be like okay but

213
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,110
it's kind of the problem is is now you

214
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:42,838
like to Ed's point you've now turned it

215
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,659
over to you know GTI or Crisco labs or

216
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:49,769
acreage that the big issue with New

217
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:52,110
Jersey right now is the taxes we have

218
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:53,649
the legislature I think in their latest

219
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:57,669
proposal

220
00:08:53,649 --> 00:09:01,350
have contemplated 12% tax rate and the

221
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:03,938
governor wants a 25% tax rate and and

222
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,528
before they're like even getting down

223
00:09:03,938 --> 00:09:08,078
and dirty with like what the regulatory

224
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:10,720
issues look like they need to figure out

225
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:13,328
how much tax is going to be on this and

226
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,790
I think they have until about April to

227
00:09:13,328 --> 00:09:18,428
figure out that issue but but that's the

228
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:20,860
problem we've had in California is that

229
00:09:18,428 --> 00:09:25,558
there's there's too much tax in

230
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:29,019
California the the state excise tax is

231
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:31,088
15% the state sales tax is seven and a

232
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:33,399
half percent and then the cities and

233
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:36,519
counties get to add tax on top of that

234
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:39,220
in Los Angeles to buy adult use cannabis

235
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:42,610
it's a 33 percent tax and with the tax

236
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,939
that high folks continue to support the

237
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:49,149
unlicensed market because it's it's that

238
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:50,948
much cheaper and so you know the folks

239
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:53,948
in New Jersey the folks in New York

240
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:55,990
everyone like looks at this as you know

241
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:57,639
a panacea for tax revenue that this is

242
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:01,028
going to solve all the state's problems

243
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:03,039
it's not it's over taxed that you need

244
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:05,980
to bring it down if you want like the

245
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,490
overall system to succeed these these

246
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,808
high taxes are completely unsustainable

247
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,579
right so I think that's gonna be the key

248
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:13,870
for New York and New Jersey is to make

249
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,849
sure that they don't make some of the

250
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,620
mistakes that California has made or

251
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,928
even Oregon I'm sure a lot of people

252
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,169
realize in Oregon the price of cannabis

253
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:24,730
is has fallen through the floor and a

254
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:26,919
lot of that has ended up in the black

255
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,589
market and honestly a lot of it is in

256
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:32,549
New York so all your black market

257
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:35,290
dealers are all selling you Oregon weed

258
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:40,958
it's true it's true it's all ended up by

259
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:43,328
here but going back to go back to

260
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:46,058
Debra's point about what's gonna happen

261
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:47,859
in New Jersey in New York this whole

262
00:10:46,058 --> 00:10:49,688
notion of first mover advantage you know

263
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,909
I live in Connecticut and we saw many

264
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:53,438
years ago they climbed on to putting

265
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:55,868
casinos in there weren't in New Jersey

266
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:57,548
and it brought in all sorts of people

267
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:59,559
from Rhode Island from Massachusetts New

268
00:10:57,548 --> 00:11:02,980
York and then guess what happens other

269
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:04,719
states are like hey us too so they'll go

270
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,089
ahead and start doing that and it's the

271
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,540
same thing with liquor taxes gasoline

272
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:08,529
tax

273
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:10,299
I mean you see that people crossing

274
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:10,838
state lines I think the same behavior is

275
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:13,149
gonna happen

276
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,769
and because cannabis has played out so

277
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:18,370
much more publicly across the United

278
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:19,600
States I think it's a lot faster

279
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,278
you know people is that fear of missing

280
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,350
out like in this case it's a fear of

281
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,269
missing out on tax dollars so I think

282
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,540
it's gonna definitely move more quickly

283
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:30,370
than casinos which took a long time well

284
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:33,849
and I feel like in New York the medical

285
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:36,578
players are already setting themselves

286
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:40,480
up to re reckless because you've got

287
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:43,419
memens store on Fifth Avenue you've got

288
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,970
I think it's a anthis that is going to

289
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:50,649
have the Brooklyn store across from the

290
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:52,509
Barclays Center you know you can really

291
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:56,589
feel like these locations they picked

292
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:59,139
they picked for recreational in mind but

293
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:01,180
I guess it's still too early on New York

294
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:03,190
to even know where we're gonna go with

295
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,409
the adult use well well that's

296
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,000
interesting because you get in in New

297
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:09,129
Jersey they are giving prior in the

298
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,379
proposal they are giving priority to the

299
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:14,289
existing licensees so that's that's

300
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:17,379
happened in almost every state but you

301
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:20,588
know just from our experience New York

302
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:22,750
has so few licensees and in Los Angeles

303
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:25,389
there's what like 7 million people or

304
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,818
something there's there's about 200

305
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:30,240
licensed shops just under and then

306
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:33,429
another you know three to four hundred

307
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,549
unlicensed shops so like the folks who

308
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:40,149
know that and realize if we can keep New

309
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:42,490
York to you know 25 or under shops or 50

310
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:44,889
or under shops they're they're seeing

311
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,680
like the potential cash Bonanza there

312
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:50,110
with a small number of shops like it's

313
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,359
it's really instrumental that if you

314
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:55,509
know regular folks are going to be able

315
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,209
to own these businesses that the state

316
00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:01,600
pursues policies for low barrier to

317
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:03,638
entry low capital cost to entry and high

318
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,920
number of participants let let the

319
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,720
market sort it out the good operators

320
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,370
are gonna rise to the top the bad

321
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,939
operators are gonna go out of business

322
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:15,759
but to artificially close a marketplace

323
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:17,980
so that you're handing you know lottery

324
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,600
tickets to a few select businesses to

325
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,750
make tens of millions of dollars each

326
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,930
year

327
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:26,778
it isn't it's unsustainable in Toronto

328
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:29,750
for Ontario this the province of Ontario

329
00:13:26,778 --> 00:13:33,588
received 2,500 applications for their

330
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:35,240
license lottery with $70 to enter 2500

331
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:37,550
people applied for their chance to get a

332
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,789
retail license New York would be making

333
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:42,679
a tremendous mistake if they kept it as

334
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:44,870
limited as they've kept the medical

335
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:48,620
program and and I don't think they will

336
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:51,649
because in New York the winning argument

337
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,688
has been social equity the harm to the

338
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:55,639
folks who have been impacted by the war

339
00:13:53,688 --> 00:13:57,948
on drugs the communities that have been

340
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,470
impacted by on the war on drugs it

341
00:13:57,948 --> 00:14:02,568
started during the the governor's race

342
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,240
and that was the issue that Cynthia

343
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:08,328
Nixon champion and and Cuomo and his

344
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,459
proposal has kept at least you know he's

345
00:14:08,328 --> 00:14:13,729
paid homage to it that you know we're

346
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:16,338
looking to help and find opportunities

347
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:19,430
for those communities to get licenses

348
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:21,290
his proposal is about 200 pages I

349
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:23,809
haven't read every detail in it yet so I

350
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:25,639
can't like fact check it but at least

351
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:28,609
you know the media talking points they

352
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,289
are like talking about social equity and

353
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,389
if you're not familiar with New York

354
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:34,219
right now there's 10 licenses they

355
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:35,480
started with 5 and then they realized

356
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,899
that what's not enough and they bumped

357
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,209
it up to 10 and within that 10 really

358
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:43,039
the they're almost all the MS OHS which

359
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:45,229
is what we call them the multi-state

360
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,500
operators RMS OHS and I I'd have to

361
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,850
believe that the those existing holders

362
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,009
are going to have first dibs because

363
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,899
they've been bleeding cash there's no

364
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:55,610
revenue coming into New York for the

365
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:57,649
medical marijuana program it's too

366
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,589
restrictive there's lack of doctor

367
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:02,089
participation if you go to Union Square

368
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:04,279
I think that's the closest dispensary

369
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:06,439
here there's probably nobody there

370
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,958
well if you write that one of the first

371
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:10,759
5 licenses I think was Bloomfield sold

372
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,948
to med man yeah and they were gaining

373
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:14,419
the loss and they're enduring it they're

374
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:16,789
well capitalized these companies but

375
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:18,740
they're enduring the pain because they

376
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:20,328
believe that they will be the first in

377
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,639
line for when it goes wreck

378
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:27,198
all right because men men's 5th Avenue

379
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,698
store I've heard is it's not five ten

380
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,068
thousand dollars a month yeah I mean but

381
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:34,008
the thing is in New York City the black

382
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:34,309
market it's so robust the black market

383
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:36,199
here

384
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:39,979
dad I could get we delivered quicker

385
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:41,990
than a pizza and it's for Morgan and

386
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,938
it's really good yeah it's really good

387
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,289
but the other thing too is like people

388
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:47,870
think oh yeah I'm gonna get a license

389
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:49,309
and it's a ticket you know for success

390
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,289
in the lottery ticket and all that and

391
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:53,028
even you know the big players that are

392
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:55,009
coming in the the thing that's really

393
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:57,139
the biggest risk factor I see is

394
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:59,688
deletion because at any point in time

395
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:01,850
the state will then issue additional

396
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:04,610
licenses the New York went from five to

397
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,370
ten Connecticut doubled their licenses

398
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:10,278
New Jersey doubled their licenses so

399
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,959
that valuation suddenly gets diminished

400
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:13,789
but not Rhode Island they said listen

401
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:16,308
we'll pay you five million dollars the

402
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:18,139
three of us if you won't add any more

403
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,850
dispensaries and the state said I'll

404
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:21,259
take your money and it's and at some

405
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,569
point when you think of these stocks

406
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:25,818
these multi-state operators this should

407
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:28,370
all have an impact on the share price

408
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:31,370
any of the moves that the states make

409
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:34,068
should impact this we're not really

410
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,808
seeing that yet right right and and you

411
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:38,539
know i I've got that kind of love/hate

412
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:40,610
with the MSOs because on the one hand by

413
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:43,429
having that much money and having a

414
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:48,438
really nice corporate organization they

415
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:50,088
are able to accomplish a lot but it's

416
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:52,219
all a bunch of middle-aged white men and

417
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:54,350
that kind of bugs me you know I look at

418
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,050
their c-suite and I see very few people

419
00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:02,659
of color or it's the token woman that's

420
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:05,029
the head of HR and you know a former NFL

421
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:09,078
player who they put on their board and

422
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:11,480
and it just really irritates me but

423
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:14,720
they're well funded they're very

424
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,380
polished they come in and you know you

425
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,929
throw a star you know politician on your

426
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,780
board and there you go and they manage

427
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:26,780
to open up a lot of doors but even in

428
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:30,678
New York I think attained is one of the

429
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:34,819
few female owned businesses here in New

430
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:38,179
York all right CEO went to Hamilton

431
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:39,319
College so well the other thing I was

432
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:41,809
going to say about those management team

433
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:45,379
to Deborah referenced is that I've seen

434
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:46,398
a lot more of them now being people with

435
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,809
a lot of consumer packaged goods

436
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,079
experience they come out of Procter and

437
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:49,579
Gamble

438
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,678
they come out of molson they come out of

439
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:55,038
other wrigley so we're starting to see

440
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,679
you know the management coming in from

441
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:01,250
these other traditional big company

442
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,528
industries and really start to take some

443
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,109
of the senior roles in in these big

444
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:08,058
brands right I mean I think the one that

445
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:10,009
bugs me the most is green growth brands

446
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:12,319
those guys were all like laid off

447
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:19,220
Victoria's Secret folks out of Columbus

448
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:20,869
Ohio and so they come into the industry

449
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,450
and they're like ah man

450
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:25,518
all these cannabis dispensaries they

451
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,819
don't know how to sell we know retail

452
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:32,599
because we sold bras and we're gonna

453
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:35,839
show them how to do it and they buy a

454
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:37,668
dispensary in Las Vegas the source which

455
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,439
is already doing 17 million dollars a

456
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:40,669
year so thinking well apparently they

457
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,440
know how to do it because they're doing

458
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:43,630
17 million dollars a year which is not

459
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,080
too shabby

460
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:49,580
but yeah their their claim to fame is

461
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:53,240
that they're all from Victoria's Secret

462
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:55,839
which in my opinion was a bunch of men

463
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,009
selling bras to women and over

464
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,619
objectifying the women and hyper

465
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:03,169
sexualizing them and it was awful and

466
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:05,089
they lost sight of the fact that there

467
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:06,590
was a whole hashtag me too and college

468
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:10,298
rape and they were not paying attention

469
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:13,609
to that and to me they were not really

470
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:16,849
good retailers and to come into the

471
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:19,009
connect cannabis industry a little late

472
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:21,349
to the party and to say that they knew

473
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:24,079
how to do it and no one else did really

474
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:27,230
bugged me but what's interesting is that

475
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,788
they just made a bid to buy another

476
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,409
company and that kind of brings us to

477
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:31,619
our next topic which is consolidation

478
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:33,419
we're seeing

479
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:35,699
one of consolidation happening in the

480
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,580
market right now I feel like every week

481
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:41,590
I'm talking about another acquisition

482
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:50,528
that happen is happening

483
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:50,528
