1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:11,509
[Music]

2
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:14,869
yeah yeah what about what about the

3
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:17,660
prospects of breeding cannabis plants

4
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:19,699
for resistance or tolerance to say some

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:25,060
of the common pests like thrips

6
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:28,250
and mites so as I told you earlier

7
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:32,269
cannabis is really gap bridging now a

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:34,878
gap of 30 years of well illegal research

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:38,000
so we hadn't there's a huge gap in

10
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:41,988
technology so now we're jumping directly

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,480
into into breeding it into gapping those

12
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:47,030
30 years and a lot of the things that

13
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:50,148
are so-called low-hanging fruits in

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:52,579
other crops like resistances are just

15
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:55,939
not there so there needs to be people

16
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,698
like you in in the image in a pest

17
00:00:55,939 --> 00:01:01,780
management world coming up with germ

18
00:00:58,698 --> 00:01:04,489
plasm that's tested we need more

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:08,269
phenotyping systems we need to isolate

20
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:10,490
the genes we do the part where we find a

21
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:12,560
gene but we need germ plasm like we

22
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:16,339
talked about earlier we need the germ

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,700
plasm and we need a scoring system a lot

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:22,850
of times I talk to companies that do

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:26,990
breeding and they say okay how do we

26
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:29,929
score our resistance and we don't do

27
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:32,118
that we need collaboration with the pest

28
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,460
management people that would be a good

29
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:36,319
tie in because you know there's been

30
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:39,349
studies in entomology for many years

31
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:42,019
that we call host plant resistance or

32
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:44,118
tolerance and biocontrol can work hand

33
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:47,449
in hand or conjunction having plants

34
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:49,728
that are resistant that could be used in

35
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,019
combination with the biologicals like

36
00:01:49,728 --> 00:01:54,438
predators and parasitoids

37
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:56,899
to enhance the the reduction or

38
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:59,379
suppression of pests on a plant like

39
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:59,379
cannabis

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,250
there are these could be physical stuff

41
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,990
these could be a better performance of

42
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:17,340
the plant in a very mixed system where

43
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:20,310
you have total pest management it could

44
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,340
be hairs on the leaves that prevent the

45
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,319
trichomes yeah it not necessarily

46
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,420
trichomes it could be hairy varieties

47
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,389
like you have in tomatoes prevention we

48
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:33,539
need yeah yeah we need those sources we

49
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:37,529
need people who have collected germ

50
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:40,739
plasm exotic germ plasm and if it's a

51
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:44,459
problem we need to breed for it so it

52
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:47,030
calls for collaborations of institutions

53
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:51,719
companies like myself and like yourself

54
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:54,180
to work together and generate new germ

55
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,030
plasm that's resistant it won't be that

56
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,670
much need for pesticides everybody's

57
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,370
going to be happy with that right and

58
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:04,799
and to me the the crop in question is

59
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,689
strictly a henderson biological because

60
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,730
there's no need to spray when you're

61
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,699
worried about residue issues and you

62
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:14,340
know we have the biological agents for

63
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:17,129
each of those given pests but if we if

64
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,150
there's an idea or methodology where we

65
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:22,199
can have plants that are more tolerant

66
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,569
whether it be through chemical nature

67
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:28,530
physical nature that might enhance the

68
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:30,689
efficacy of the biological agents what

69
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,239
were the key take-home messages from

70
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:35,340
your presentation earlier today yeah the

71
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,340
key points that I wanted to get across

72
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,379
was for identifying the insect amide

73
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,989
pest you're dealing with and that will

74
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,489
allow you to select the appropriate

75
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,719
biologic control agents and then the

76
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,269
other part was the quality control

77
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:51,090
aspect you know when you get material

78
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,709
from your supplier be sure it's alive

79
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,340
and functional before you make your

80
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,379
releases

81
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,159
because that's going to ensure the

82
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:02,419
success of the biocontrol agents on the

83
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,419
specific pests in your crop

84
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,069
I know I know one of the major concern

85
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,189
coming up is the the road ace it's the

86
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:18,589
road a fits I've been getting calls

87
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:20,930
inquiries regarding that and one of my

88
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,989
suggestions is the use of de l'eau

89
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:26,000
Shakur er which is the RO beetle that

90
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,189
might it's a generalist predator so that

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,019
so I'm that would be something if you're

92
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:32,329
trying to deal with Road a if it's you

93
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:35,000
have Road aphids in your operation then

94
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:37,129
I would contact the suppliers and try to

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,779
start using the RO beetle de Lucia

96
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:41,810
quarry ARA and see how it does

97
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:45,049
III think overall that the key pastor

98
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,389
thrips mites and then includes area

99
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,800
fight mites and broad mites and Russert

100
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,418
mites those are pretty

101
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,610
those are pretty consistent across the

102
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:55,430
country because everybody's growing the

103
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,379
same crop so it's really hard for me to

104
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,150
say that in Washington they're having an

105
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:00,500
outbreak of this and in Maine they're

106
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:02,959
having an outbreak of something else I

107
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,120
actually can comment on that because I

108
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,209
have a broader perspective I think on

109
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,379
the industry because we're working with

110
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:14,418
with companies in Europe and in Canada

111
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:19,459
so Canada has a lot of fungal diseases

112
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:22,639
but there is also reports now of viral

113
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:26,779
diseases being propagated or dispersed

114
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,029
through insect agents they're not truly

115
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:31,579
identified yet but there's talk of three

116
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:35,989
viruses that are probably spread by

117
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:39,439
aphids and I've heard it's it's a rumor

118
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,689
right now of crops grown outdoors in the

119
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,969
hemp space in Oregon where it's

120
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:44,629
mysterious disease they don't even know

121
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,850
what it is

122
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:50,060
wipes out entire crops and spreading

123
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:53,330
from South North Oregon so it could be

124
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:57,050
just rumors now but these things happen

125
00:05:53,329 --> 00:06:00,439
and as breeders and cultivators we must

126
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:03,949
be prepared we must have in a germ plasm

127
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:10,969
collection and means to characterize and

128
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:14,329
to breed fast for to fight back with

129
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:16,700
whatever strikes our crops I think an

130
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:18,168
important message also is that you know

131
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:19,800
in the greenhouse you have a certain

132
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:22,620
color

133
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,990
types of multiple complex but when you

134
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,079
grow outdoors then you're susceptible to

135
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,879
other types of insects that includes

136
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,490
vectors like leaf hoppers and psyllids

137
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,589
and caterpillars and other actually

138
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:38,129
beetles more so in the green so when you

139
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:39,689
grow outdoors you're getting a I would

140
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:41,490
say a plethora of different types of

141
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:44,170
insects where your complex is different

142
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:56,120
than it might be in a greenhouse

143
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:56,120
