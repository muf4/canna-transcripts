1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
[Music]

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,669
we think about what cannabis cultivation

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,500
really is it is cut flower production

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:12,629
music this is nothing but more than cut

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,789
flower or floriculture really that's my

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,260
PhD was in the vast majority of my PhD

7
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,989
research was funded by the international

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,730
cut flower Growers Association and you

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:22,559
know when we we started doing this

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,079
research cutting-edge hydroponic

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,489
research we always have cannabis

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,589
cultivators coming in and talking to us

13
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:30,689
UC Davis the public university and him

14
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,399
to walk in campus and know I always kind

15
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,409
of knew that cannabis might be in my

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,370
future when I was working on my PhD but

17
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:41,729
what was that so I finished my PhD in

18
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,289
2008 uh-huh I'm a big proponent a big

19
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:46,049
fan of evidence-based decision making

20
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,539
you know I want to look at studies I

21
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,288
want to look at research and I want to

22
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:52,020
you know have a full understanding

23
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,370
before I make a real big decision now

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,690
it's not something we can always do in

25
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,238
the cannabis world just because there's

26
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,649
sometimes a lack of research but you

27
00:00:57,238 --> 00:00:59,909
know one thing that's interesting with

28
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,250
cannabis is there a lot of analogous

29
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,119
plants out there and so you know we

30
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,920
don't have to reinvent the wheel

31
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,569
sometimes there's oftentimes research

32
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,150
that's done on plants like chrysanthemum

33
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:11,069
that have somewhat similar you know

34
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,228
research topics they can go through and

35
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,449
very analogous plan how did that get you

36
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:17,009
interested in cannabis you're have you

37
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,469
done any research on the cannabis plant

38
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,469
so at the universe California we're not

39
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:25,650
allowed to do work on cannabis no this

40
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:28,170
is the campus at UC Davis has you know

41
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,439
some are north of 660 million dollars a

42
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,868
federal grant money they don't want to

43
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:35,279
jeopardize however my PhD research was

44
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:37,019
on cut flower production roses and

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,840
chrysanthemum general but when I got

46
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:42,989
into the cannabis industry is basically

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,520
out of friend who sent me a you know

48
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:47,149
forwarded me a job description for

49
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,959
production manager position spark and

50
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,478
you know I looked at this and I'm like

51
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,368
you know the the job description is

52
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,319
horticulture 101 this is you know

53
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:57,149
they're asking very basic questions and

54
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,039
you know understandably so that's you

55
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,109
know that's all that cannabis is is just

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,030
horticulture and so I went to that

57
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:04,530
interview and I met with Eric Pearson

58
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,180
who's the founder of spark and an

59
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,129
executive and and the executor of the

60
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,830
time

61
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:11,689
my name is Robert Jacob and basically is

62
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,099
one of the easiest interviews I've ever

63
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:15,259
had just because we were asking

64
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:17,659
horticultural questions which I happen

65
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:18,829
to have a specific expertise in mm-hmm

66
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,509
eventually Eric versus just like

67
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,680
slamming some hand on the table and

68
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:24,919
walks I was like I gotta go to work as

69
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,550
Hiram and I get a call the next day from

70
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:29,958
our Jacob and he basically says so we

71
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,969
think you're overqualified for a

72
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,739
production manager position so we've

73
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:36,729
created a production director position

74
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:39,560
you're gonna oversee the entire you know

75
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:40,159
production cycle and everything with

76
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,530
inspark

77
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,060
on the production side so they were they

78
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,400
were growing at that time they were

79
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,348
growing at the time yeah yeah Eric

80
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,539
Pearson has been cultivating since the

81
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:52,189
late 90s however he was trying to step

82
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:53,810
away from cultivation more and more and

83
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:56,180
they they needed someone that they can

84
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,329
kind of trust and to come in and take it

85
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,159
over so um is that what you did yes and

86
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:03,349
so I oversee personal aspect of it when

87
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:06,139
I first got there on the very first day

88
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:08,539
you know Eric Pearson took me one of the

89
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:10,250
facilities there's an indoor facility

90
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:12,590
inside San Francisco so it's an indoor

91
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,359
production it's grown in hydroponics

92
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,609
which is obviously very well versed in

93
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:19,090
and he's like Robbie there's something

94
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:22,700
wrong with our this facility we are

95
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,319
fertigation lines keep on gumming up I'm

96
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:27,798
like already running through there and

97
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:30,828
yeah you know we got our water Nuge you

98
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,700
know pH yada yada and then he's like oh

99
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:33,769
we're also putting something in there

100
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:35,899
called Mendocino honey and I'm thinking

101
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:36,859
myself okay Mendocino honey he's like

102
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,900
well I'm like what's that it's like

103
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:39,980
what's kind of molasses I'm like well

104
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,480
that sounds like it might be the culprit

105
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:43,699
why are you putting the menacing oh

106
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:45,259
honey in there it's like I don't know we

107
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,060
just been told to put that in there and

108
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:49,068
so that was like okay well first we

109
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,389
reduce remove that you know because

110
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:51,858
ultimately they're putting a

111
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:53,030
carbohydrate in the in the root zone and

112
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:54,290
the only reason why you'd want to do

113
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,969
that is if you're growing with organic

114
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:57,828
fertilizers and you want the you know

115
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:59,239
because plants don't absorb organic

116
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:00,680
fertilizer in all honesty they absorb

117
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,030
mineral nutrients but that organic

118
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,340
fertilizer has to break down into that

119
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,229
mineral nutrient in order to do that you

120
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,670
know if you add the sugar you might be

121
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:09,679
speeding up some microbial activity that

122
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:11,659
will speed up that process or if you

123
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,000
want to increase the the microbial

124
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:16,279
beneficial microbial activity to maybe

125
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,720
perhaps out-compete a pathogen

126
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,738
that's why you would put the

127
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,359
carbohydrates in there and so I'm

128
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:21,649
thinking myself when I first got in

129
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,989
stream I okay I've never heard of this

130
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:25,909
I've never seen this done before you

131
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,740
know and I've been around the block a

132
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,300
time or two and so I called a couple

133
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,220
friends one of my friends the professor

134
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,480
at Cornell in horticulture and I called

135
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,190
him I'm like have you heard of this

136
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,960
because I've never heard of that and I

137
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:37,339
called one another my friends who's a at

138
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:39,169
the time was the director of research at

139
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:40,579
Ball horticulture out of West Chicago

140
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,750
and I call him and he's like have you

141
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:44,300
heard of this thing never heard of it

142
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,519
when they heard about it what they it

143
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,980
what did they heard about they've never

144
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:51,289
heard of people putting a carbohydrate I

145
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,180
mean these guys when did they start

146
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,740
doing it was it on old wives you know

147
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,750
it's an old wife still now now there is

148
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,610
something to it however if you're

149
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,589
growing hydroponically and you know

150
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,389
you're fertig ating which means you're

151
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:03,739
you're irrigating fertilizing on a

152
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,289
regular basis I'm a hand feeding

153
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,370
nutrients and water this plant I don't

154
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:13,760
want that plant to go out exploring for

155
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,889
for those nutrients and I'm him I'm

156
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,860
hand-delivering to this plant and

157
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:20,810
already processed nutrient so that plant

158
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,210
can just very readily absorb it so it's

159
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,879
highly bioavailable so I don't need to

160
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:27,889
increase the the respiration rate of

161
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:31,159
microbes are gonna break that down don't

162
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:32,750
need to do that and so you know I want

163
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,780
to limit the root zone as much as I can

164
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,189
without affecting that to help the plant

165
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:39,289
because that gives a - stretch the plant

166
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:41,329
actually pushes more sugar and carbon to

167
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,700
the shoot system and that actually is

168
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:45,319
what you're pushing for teaches a 21

169
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:47,389
carbon molecule it's expensive for the

170
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,310
plant to make I want to make sure that

171
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:52,099
the budget for carbon is allocated

172
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,540
properly and to an effect that we're

173
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,760
manipulating the physiology anatomy of

174
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,129
the plant but you know for our own needs

175
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,930
did this experience tell you something

176
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:02,990
about how people in the industry were

177
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:05,478
approaching cultivation yeah you know I

178
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,490
think a lot of people you know I will

179
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:08,539
always say time and time again that I'm

180
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,189
standing on the shoulders of giants

181
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,260
there are people who came you know

182
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:13,790
decades before me cultivating cannabis I

183
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:15,740
mean the plants been cultivated for

184
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,229
millennia so not just decades but

185
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,210
millennia but you know what's

186
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:23,719
unfortunate about cannabis is because of

187
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:25,649
its legal issues in this country

188
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,570
people the cultivators who have been

189
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:29,519
doing this up in the the hills and the

190
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:31,589
Emerald triangle haven't had access to

191
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,719
the Cooperative Extension research at UC

192
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:35,939
Davis or no Cal Poly or NC State

193
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,830
Michigan State Cornell they can't go and

194
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,168
say hey I've got this issue I need help

195
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:41,639
you know and that's what these

196
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:44,788
universities are meant to do is to

197
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,019
provide assistance to - to the coal

198
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:47,849
today do you think that because I

199
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,788
interviewed Reggie Gowdy no recent

200
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,199
business that he because he told me the

201
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:54,029
exact same did that he would he had his

202
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,650
papers published I think he sees

203
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:57,598
everything he was working with them but

204
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:59,038
because they couldn't touch the plant he

205
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,469
had to do the talk to you but once I got

206
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,418
to pass that it - because they can do

207
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,820
they can do the DNA yeah

208
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:08,279
so once he extracted then they could

209
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,199
work together exactly because it's no

210
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:13,409
longer cannabis is Ryan a right exactly

211
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,759
which is so ironic yes yeah but that's

212
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,979
where there's a lot of the research and

213
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,960
science is done yes exactly and what

214
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:21,418
unfortunate about that though is you

215
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,448
know research that's geared towards

216
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:26,579
cultivation and know for making it more

217
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:28,439
efficient and once again the

218
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,538
horticulture and it in horticulture

219
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,579
agriculture the the terms sustainable

220
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:34,620
and efficient are synonymous so if

221
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:35,609
you're becoming more efficient becoming

222
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,168
more sustainable which I think

223
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,759
everyone's been doing but anyway to

224
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:41,339
become more efficient grower having

225
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,129
access to a whole plant physiologist at

226
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:47,310
UC Davis who's basically non-existent at

227
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:49,050
this point it's more more happening and

228
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,639
you know the universe California is

229
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,560
starting to see a lot of proposals on

230
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,699
hemp obviously since the farm bill

231
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,098
passed right

232
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,439
but cannabis is still you know

233
00:07:56,098 --> 00:08:01,469
considered a four-letter word at bidc

234
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,668
regions which I'm you know I had the

235
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,099
sincere pleasure to speak with the Dean

236
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:06,689
of Ag Sciences and for Advisory Council

237
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:07,860
used to Davis and you know talking about

238
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:09,598
the low-hanging fruit that is cannabis

239
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,610
research and I said listen hemp and

240
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,750
cannabis do the same species they're

241
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,889
just different varieties it's just like

242
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,439
if I would have a red rose and a white

243
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:18,030
rose same thing that's unfortunate my

244
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,189
understanding is the scientists are

245
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,529
really like champing at the bit to do

246
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:24,509
this work 100% academics see cannabis

247
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:27,059
like any other planet it could be a rose

248
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:29,930
it could be a corn it could be anything

249
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:33,259
one question about sustainability

250
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:37,339
and and the commodification of this

251
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:41,360
plant and scaled cultivation or those

252
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:43,339
things synonymous so true

253
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,600
commoditization of cannabis I think is

254
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:46,820
gonna be difficult to achieve you know a

255
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,040
lot of my research has really been about

256
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,240
around mathematical modeling and when

257
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,399
you're doing mathematical modeling for a

258
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,589
biological system allows you to make

259
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,439
predictions with some level of

260
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:58,820
confidence than is and so that's what

261
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,830
I'm really interested in doing and

262
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,660
specifically one of the the primary

263
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,639
goals of horticulture generals uniform

264
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:06,439
me across the problem so your crop

265
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,569
ecology you want to have a uniform crop

266
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,589
time and time and time again perfect

267
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,140
example I always like to give as

268
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:14,450
poinsettias know if you're a poinsettia

269
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:16,580
grower you're likely to have a contract

270
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,528
with Home Depot or Lowe's and Home Depot

271
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,900
saying okay here's your end cap you have

272
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:23,389
18 inches if it's outside of that range

273
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:26,208
we're not buying that product and so you

274
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:27,980
have to be very uniform very precise and

275
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,449
that's really the goal of Canada so the

276
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,920
type of resource I'm interested in doing

277
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,959
that I am doing and that we're working

278
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:34,699
on currently is a lot of our

279
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,458
intelligence researchers actually of

280
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,080
helping us build out these models of

281
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:41,119
really developing heat maps in

282
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,570
individual facilities and grow rooms and

283
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,389
so seeing where you know for some reason

284
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,860
at this one spot in this facility they

285
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:51,679
have higher yields or we have higher THC

286
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,379
and trying to figure out why that is and

287
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:57,259
so you know doing that type of research

288
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:59,330
then you can understanding what are

289
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:03,049
those environment environmental abiotic

290
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:05,540
factors that are assisting you in that

291
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:07,969
you know increased yield and it seems we

292
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:10,370
can try to replicate that so trying to

293
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:13,430
create a very uniform crop but at the

294
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,620
same time optimizing you know why is it

295
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:16,129
doing well here not over here and trying

296
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,740
to figure that out

297
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:20,838
what are you doing at I need your

298
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,600
business so are you creating products

299
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,250
yeah so we we do have products so we

300
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,730
have two products right now and we will

301
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,589
be launching a third one this fall as

302
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,539
well the reason why I started da crop

303
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:34,070
farms was because when I was still at

304
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:36,649
spark

305
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,879
I received a phone call from my mom my

306
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:40,009
mom was called me to let me know that

307
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,700
she was diagnosed with triple negative

308
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:42,590
breast cancer

309
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,780
she's grown the cancer free though we

310
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,730
caught it very early and you know as she

311
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:49,039
went through bouts of chemo radiate and

312
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:52,029
radiation therapies she had two bouts of

313
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,589
surgery to remove tumors you know my mom

314
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:56,120
went to college in the 60s was invited

315
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,340
to a party and I'm literally not

316
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,179
exaggerating this actually to happen she

317
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,850
thought she was going to a Tupperware

318
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:03,739
showing party so my mom calls me to let

319
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,360
me know about this diagnosis I let her

320
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,009
know I said hey I can get you access to

321
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,350
cannabis and there's a lot of canvas

322
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:13,819
that I grown personally that I she she's

323
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:17,600
section the valley you know she's in San

324
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,040
Fran of Valley yeah and you know I told

325
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,230
her I give her access to cannabis and

326
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,429
she said oh that's great I want I don't

327
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,320
want a smoke people or available though

328
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:25,759
I only want an edible and everything I

329
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,800
had groomed I knew was clean

330
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,480
but I knew did not have you know plant

331
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:30,979
growth regulators or Michael butanol

332
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,420
which releases hydrogen cyanide heat it

333
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,500
up you know I was not gonna be any good

334
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:38,089
for her because I was gonna have to go

335
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,409
source something for an edible right and

336
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,720
so I was thinking to myself am I about

337
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:43,610
to poison my mom right and so that was

338
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,680
really the birth of dr. Rob farms so

339
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,480
what did you envision and edible I'm

340
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,639
gonna make it edible for I envisioned

341
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,580
who I envisioned a line of products

342
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,559
because as my thinking was okay at that

343
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,700
time you know I've done a lot of

344
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,159
consulting work and I see what people

345
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,330
are putting on those plants yeah and I

346
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,889
was thinking well I have the expertise

347
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,920
and I have the experience to grow this

348
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:05,539
product on a very large scale and still

349
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,569
have a very tremendous amount of high

350
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:10,189
quality product there's no give me more

351
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,260
people out there other than just my mom

352
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,690
so you can stuff in the soil yes exactly

353
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:17,269
so a vertical supply chain my expertise

354
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:20,090
is cultivation so what was the next step

355
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:22,639
when you decided that that was what you

356
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:24,290
wanted to do it is really starting to

357
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,269
okay why you have a lot of great

358
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:27,949
relationships with some great growers

359
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:29,600
that are following center operate

360
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,000
procedures that I approve or have

361
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,800
written for them and for sourcing

362
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,039
product from them however I was always

363
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:39,929
interested in large scale cultivation

364
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,659
not only just large-scale but something

365
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:45,388
that's heavily involved including

366
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:48,208
technology into cultivation I think that

367
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:49,649
is where the future of not just cannabis

368
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:53,250
but agriculture in general is going

369
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:56,698
towards you know I have a lot of love a

370
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:59,278
lot of love for different types of of

371
00:12:56,698 --> 00:13:02,399
cultivation there's no wrong truly wrong

372
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,049
way to grow but what I'm interested in

373
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,750
is is efficiency and sustainability

374
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:09,389
Academy so what methods are you drawn to

375
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,929
them if those are your priorities so I

376
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:14,759
like to grow with full Sun spectrum so

377
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:17,458
full Sun the reason why that's important

378
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:20,220
is there are photoreceptors in the plant

379
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:22,109
you know that when triggered actually

380
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,579
increased the yield and this is

381
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,800
something you don't typically see you

382
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:27,359
don't you almost never see in a

383
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,490
warehouse production you're almost never

384
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,778
seen in greenhouse you will see it in an

385
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,698
outdoor productions because you have

386
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:34,948
full exposure to the Sun so if you know

387
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:36,958
what you're doing you can kind of kind

388
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:39,870
of gain access and you know hack the

389
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,909
physiology of the plant what I'm also

390
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,129
interested in is is just the

391
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:45,870
sustainability of of cultivation in

392
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:48,360
general of increasing that as much as

393
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:51,810
possible I can't get into too much

394
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,490
detail quite yet but there's a we've

395
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:57,869
we've put together a quite a large

396
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:59,190
renewable energy program that will

397
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,250
basically be covering roughly half of

398
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,690
our energy needs one of the big things

399
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,568
I'm very interested in also is

400
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:09,209
integrated pest management so you know

401
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:13,198
our motto is good good science clean

402
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:14,519
cannabis we we want to use science to to

403
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,169
provide

404
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,149
you know a clean working environment for

405
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:19,860
the plants to grow in one thing that

406
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,720
we're lucky with in cannabis it's not an

407
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,460
ornamental crop so going back to that

408
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,230
point set of discussion if I'm in home

409
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,400
depot and I go to the endcap and I pick

410
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,170
up a coin set and we have some white

411
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,879
flies and fly off of it I'm like they're

412
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:32,069
not gonna buy it so there's a zero

413
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,809
tolerance firm for pests and an

414
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,520
ornamental crop like that or something

415
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:38,159
that is a consumable such as cannabis

416
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,360
you can have a little bit of a pest

417
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,039
population the reason why that's

418
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,629
actually a good thing is because that

419
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,879
actually increases some of the defenses

420
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:46,950
the plant has and what was the plant

421
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,019
doing has defense or needs surgery

422
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,520
defense mechanisms it actually increases

423
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,340
the carbon allocation to flower

424
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:57,049
production so do you use pests to thank

425
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:59,430
pests yes so we definitely a big fan of

426
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:03,509
biologicals that's thus I think the best

427
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:06,479
way to control pest population so in

428
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:09,149
your your grow environments do you like

429
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,460
so are they highly controlled pristine

430
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:13,949
environments yes this is you know you're

431
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,870
going in there and you know there's

432
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,300
nothing on there and it's the entire

433
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,429
facilities this way it's I prefer to

434
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:21,899
work in an environment that we call the

435
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:23,609
hybrid indoor environment it's very

436
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,250
similar to greenhouse except for it's

437
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,330
almost a step up above a greenhouse

438
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,740
what's interesting about this is it has

439
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,139
all the benefits of an indoor

440
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,370
environment now you know I probably were

441
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,299
like well what are the benefits of

442
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,590
having an urban environment

443
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,059
one thing that's nice about having an

444
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:38,100
indoor environment is you have a lot

445
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:40,229
more environmental control and once

446
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,110
again the the goal of horticulture is

447
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,820
uniformity when a patient consumes a

448
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,289
product I want that patient to have the

449
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,200
same experience time and time and time

450
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:51,029
again I don't want to have a bad

451
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,830
experience with that because if one time

452
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:54,509
it's not good for them and something

453
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,250
it's not what they were expecting it

454
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:57,840
might turn them off to the product and

455
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,840
so give you the same experience over and

456
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,910
over again is paramount now actually

457
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,700
that is true however if we're talking

458
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:07,299
about

459
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,310
rapes wines where you know different

460
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,870
harvest might be different there is name

461
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:12,549
for variability they're not different

462
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,649
cultivars you might be different we're

463
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:17,019
going different strains seasonally yes

464
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:19,569
that is 100% correct however there's one

465
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:21,100
big difference is typically I mean

466
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,200
depends on who you talk to you but wine

467
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,240
isn't really considered a medicine well

468
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,830
maybe to some people okay but you know

469
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,470
there are people who are going to be

470
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,240
using cannabis recreationally and then I

471
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,649
will also argue that the difference

472
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,889
between recreational in medical cannabis

473
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:37,329
is nil almost you know if you're using

474
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:40,000
it recreationally the chances are using

475
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,500
it for an undiagnosed symptom you know I

476
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,850
want to relax I want to you know sleep

477
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,970
at night things like that well along

478
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:48,820
those lines there may be a vertical

479
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,860
industry in this country or actually in

480
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,740
the world well in this country way that

481
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,649
the FDA oversees those products like

482
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,899
more yeah I agree with that I think a

483
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:00,129
lot of the the cannabis that is going to

484
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:01,389
be consumed in this country is going to

485
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:04,660
be considered more of like a supplement

486
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:05,650
as opposed to like you know this is a

487
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,410
flower

488
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:11,050
yeah well flower would be this cloud

489
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:14,620
where would you put flower I would put

490
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:17,529
flower on that supplemental side and you

491
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:18,849
know it is still a medicine but the

492
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:20,529
reason why though that makes it

493
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:22,869
difficult because now they're 113 owned

494
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:24,460
a monoids another 21 may have just been

495
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:26,139
discovered by the receiver's Columbia

496
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,480
there's not one active ingredient it's

497
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,470
very difficult

498
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,880
- - you know setup FDA trials on you

499
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,329
know something that has hundreds of

500
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,010
active ingredients so but you know

501
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:40,139
really you know trying to push for that

502
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:41,970
uniformity the best way to do that as an

503
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,620
environment that's fully controlled or

504
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,390
as controlled as much as you can there

505
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:46,500
are inherent variables that we can't

506
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,570
control nuts in the genetics of the

507
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,890
plant but outside of that we can control

508
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:51,480
the environment very well and so when

509
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,009
you have something like a have it into

510
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,960
our facility where you're still

511
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:57,230
accessing the energy from the Sun which

512
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,120
the quality of that light is

513
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:02,700
unparalleled the intensity that light is

514
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:05,189
is fantastic and my favorite part about

515
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,930
sunlight is it's free so that there's

516
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:10,110
the sustainability aspect and efficiency

517
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:12,120
aspect there but beyond that - you know

518
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:14,459
the quality of that light is significant

519
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,319
so I think a lot of people when they

520
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,150
onedrive photosynthesis they're just

521
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,730
interested in driving you know the the

522
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:23,130
p680 p700 which are the photosystems of

523
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,539
driving true photosynthesis and that's

524
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,700
why I see red and blue primarily driving

525
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:28,049
it and we're however there are other

526
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,789
photoreceptors in the plant and a

527
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:32,129
perfect example is the photoreceptor

528
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:34,799
called a UV RA and so UV r8 is actually

529
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,810
triggered by UVB and what that does is

530
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,759
when it's triggered is actually goes and

531
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:40,589
promotes a bow signal pathway called the

532
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,480
chocolate-based pathway produce the

533
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:44,490
compound name chow cone which produces a

534
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,579
compound named opa Tolec acid which

535
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,450
produces the compound called CB GA and

536
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:50,309
as I'm sure you know

537
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,350
CBG a is a progenitor for a vast

538
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:54,839
majority of camera codes including THC

539
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:56,699
and CBD now Jeff Lowenthal's was also

540
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,309
just saying that a huge part of the

541
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,799
effect of the real Sun is its effect on

542
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:02,549
the soil or the growing environment what

543
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,549
are you growing

544
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:07,139
I prefer hydroponics but I'm a

545
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:09,149
hydroponics all that means is it's

546
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,740
soilless media and and so what a

547
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,990
soilless media means is it means there's

548
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,819
no soil and soil is there is actual you

549
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,259
know if you were to go to Sciences yeah

550
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:18,859
I mean what do you like like coconut

551
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:22,400
core mineral

552
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:25,369
you know like I'm not opposed to clay

553
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,320
palette or true aeroponics either a lot

554
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:28,339
of my PhD research was in aeroponics

555
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:30,939
where it's just nothing more than

556
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:33,909
nutrient solution now without a doubt

557
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:36,350
the TR noir is going to be different

558
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:39,410
does not mean it's bad does not mean

559
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:40,849
it's good it's different and we just

560
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:44,870
don't understand what that is at this

561
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:47,990
point though Desert Hot Springs and the

562
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:51,619
facility whatever you could speak about

563
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:53,269
about the marketplace and or your words

564
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:55,639
where you're at with that and also with

565
00:19:53,269 --> 00:20:01,819
your licensing and all of that really

566
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:05,240
sexy stuff we um well I'm very very very

567
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:08,480
very pleased to say that we we just got

568
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,240
our first cultivation license so we are

569
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,279
the ninety-eight cultivation license

570
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:17,269
awarded in California and we're actually

571
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,099
the first for tier two mixed lights the

572
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:22,339
first in California which I'm very proud

573
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:24,139
to say and so we're licensed on that

574
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:27,919
front now what exactly does that mean

575
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,600
that language so much light means Sun

576
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,039
with supplemental lighting okay I mean

577
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,769
the reason why supplemental lighting is

578
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,960
important is you know we're using the

579
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:38,420
Sun to drive photosynthesis to really

580
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,789
push these plants well the sun's at a

581
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,980
different location in the sky in January

582
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:44,480
than it is in July and so we want to

583
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,029
make sure that DLI are the daily light

584
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,950
integral is roughly the same in January

585
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:50,930
as business you lie because once again

586
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,029
uniformity I want the same product year

587
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,519
and you know month in month out day in

588
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:58,250
day out and what I like to use for

589
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:03,559
supplemental it depends we are currently

590
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:06,109
doing a lot of research I'm a big fan of

591
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:09,049
you know the truth the Trident rude but

592
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:10,789
I'm also very progressive when it comes

593
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:13,460
to technology I want to see the new

594
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:16,099
hotness and I want to play with it in

595
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,319
fact right before we sat down a woman

596
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:20,389
came up to us and said hey check out my

597
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,480
new light and I'm very intrigued by the

598
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:26,210
plasma exactly yeah we don't seem to be

599
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,319
less hot actually less hot less energy

600
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,819
and that that's what's interesting to me

601
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,519
and so you know the supplemental

602
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:33,289
Lighting's is a big portion of having

603
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,990
this environment where you can control

604
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:38,509
these abiotic environmental factors um

605
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,210
you know but you know the MM thousand

606
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:43,309
watt HBS that that's fine and I think

607
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,840
there is some benefit to those because

608
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:46,369
they do produce infrared and I

609
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:47,569
personally believe that that infrared

610
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:50,539
actually does have a benefit to the

611
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:51,980
plant you know most people say no but I

612
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:52,909
personally believe that is and that's

613
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,339
some research that were actually

614
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:57,200
currently doing but that also you know

615
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:59,599
if we are to use different types of

616
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,559
lighting you know that also means that

617
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,109
they're gonna be different ways of

618
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,669
cultivating you know if I'm using an HP

619
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:07,579
s they're gonna be parts of the spectrum

620
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:10,759
that's gonna you know really be able to

621
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:12,679
penetrate deeper into a canopy but LED

622
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,359
tend does not have that ability at least

623
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,060
the LED or raised and I've seen thus far

624
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:19,309
so let's get back to the facility and

625
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:20,899
what you're actually literally doing

626
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:23,029
within what your plans are for it yeah

627
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:26,870
so we have to say also so we have

628
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:29,000
currently under contract five separate

629
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:30,769
facilities that we're building out each

630
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,849
one you know basically by the end of

631
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:33,139
this you're gonna have roughly one

632
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:37,039
hundred thirty thousand square feet of

633
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:38,450
canopy space the you know this is going

634
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,980
to be a hydroponic production in hybrid

635
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:46,069
indoor I'm a you know all all Sun driven

636
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:48,769
photosynthesis here you know integrated

637
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:50,679
pest management and also one of the

638
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:53,420
things I'm a big fan of the co2

639
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,860
injection carbonation which is something

640
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,560
rather difficult to do an outdoor

641
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:58,909
production or even greenhouse but if you

642
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:00,379
have used the same or the right

643
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,870
technology and we were working with a

644
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:06,470
company called AG gas that has the AI

645
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:08,719
driven co2 carbonation that this was

646
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:13,009
mind blowing in my

647
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,720
and you know using co2 to to increase

648
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:17,599
yields it's a no-brainer in my opinion

649
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,669
unfortunately not not all people are

650
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,230
able to use co2 injections because their

651
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:23,900
environments but with us a hybrid

652
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,579
endured it's perfect for it you know th

653
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,110
is a 21 carbon molecule it's expensive

654
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:29,329
for the plant to make and so I want to

655
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:31,548
provide as much of that raw ingredient

656
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:33,439
which is co2 for the plaintiff who what

657
00:23:31,548 --> 00:23:34,519
about the water out there the quality of

658
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,288
the water and what you're doing to that

659
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:38,240
you know this is what actually blew my

660
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:41,509
mind when I first went to Koh chilling

661
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,460
which is where we're at which is the as

662
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:44,900
far as I it's my understand as the

663
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,679
largest campus complex and that states

664
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:52,070
at this point when we first went there I

665
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:53,990
had two questions how we're gonna keep

666
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:56,480
the the greenhouses or the hybrid indoor

667
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:59,359
facilities cooled and what's the water

668
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,589
quality look like and I immediately they

669
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,569
having a water quality report I'm

670
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:05,509
looking over and I'm like this is

671
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:07,069
cleaner than what we have Davis and like

672
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:08,808
well how much do we have you know

673
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:10,609
because you were in a desert it can't be

674
00:24:08,808 --> 00:24:13,058
you know they're sitting on the second

675
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:15,709
largest aquifer in North America and

676
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:17,119
they're well is the captain at a

677
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,819
thousand gallons a minute but it could

678
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,109
be going at fifty nine gallons long and

679
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:22,700
what's really interesting about that too

680
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:24,408
is it's the first as far as we know

681
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,600
board certified water source for

682
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:29,240
cannabis in the country which basically

683
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:32,119
means that that that can't be tapped

684
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,220
into a sort of a cannabis users wow that

685
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:36,939
seems his mom and it's really it's a

686
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,808
really unique project and it's it's been

687
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,519
sincere pleasure working with the

688
00:24:38,808 --> 00:24:43,220
Coachella team they are fantastic people

689
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:44,629
really forward-thinking and you know

690
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,600
we've seen a lot of campus complexes

691
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,650
before when we first get when we got to

692
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,719
that we're like okay this is

693
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:52,730
fundamentally different so they're

694
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,559
embracing of technologies was right up

695
00:24:52,730 --> 00:25:01,319
my alley and you know it's a great AI

696
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,319
our fathers throughout the campus
