1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
i wasn't in this game two years ago i've

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,640
been i'm an underground grower you know

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,878
and have been in the

4
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,638
in the traditional market for over 45

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,558
years and

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,399
coming out and meeting like guys like

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,239
colin and cam over the last couple years

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,080
has really helped me understand where

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,079
the markets morphed into

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,358
and what i really appreciate appreciate

11
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,959
about what you're doing is

12
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,560
and what i believe is critical at this

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,679
point is we need to be

14
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,079
preaching out and teaching out uh

15
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,559
correct information there's so much bad

16
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,000
information out there absolutely

17
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,079
yeah that's what i'm seeing people

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,640
people hurting themselves on oils that

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,320
they don't

20
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,920
understand that that's an internal and

21
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,320
you're not supposed to smoke the damn

22
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,800
thing

23
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,320
you know and and like my practice i'm

24
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,799
holistic wildcraft organic

25
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,558
my working with cam he's where i am as

26
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,878
far as our methodologies with plants

27
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:50,320
grow

28
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,280
and just so you understand i've been

29
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,679
smoking this plant since 1970

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,760
and for me this has been my lifeline

31
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,600
because i never really was into alcohol

32
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,439
and i've done all the other drugs in the

33
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,879
70s i'm a 70s era vet

34
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:08,239
i'm a old airborne combat engineer

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,600
uh and green brave anyway

36
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,359
different world different life but

37
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,719
stepping out of that time period is what

38
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,680
helped me

39
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,000
uh embrace the plant and and learn to

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,560
grow the plant was the fact that i could

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
grow a grow my own medicine be knew

42
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,320
exactly where it came from

43
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
you know knew that it was that i'm the

44
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,359
guy you don't know what's going on

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,118
at that whole thing so that's a lot of

46
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,799
where i am with it right now is trying

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,719
to teach people i want to teach people

48
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,118
how to grow their own plant and if they

49
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,039
can't

50
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,040
grow their own plant have access to

51
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,640
stuff like what i do and what cam

52
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,880
does and what colin is a proponent for

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,118
and what you are preparing it for is

54
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,280
high quality fresh medicine

55
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,478
that comes from a reputable source that

56
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,359
we know is clean

57
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,679
and that you know the end result is is i

58
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,799
get i get that it's an intoxicant but we

59
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
use this as a

60
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,960
medicinal purpose to keep ourselves

61
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,399
balanced and regulated and and some of

62
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,679
the things i put in that

63
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,439
text i put the other day because it's

64
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,960
part of my journey is

65
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,959
this has kept me you know i'm

66
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,640
i'm a trained killer sister and it's

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,479
taken me

68
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:20,238
50 years to get out of that mindset

69
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:22,159
okay and i approached the plant keeps me

70
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,640
i was never afraid of ever killing

71
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,039
myself

72
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,919
my biggest fear was always that i would

73
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,039
do something in a

74
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,598
short moment of losing my grasp on

75
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,239
things

76
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,159
and hurt somebody or worse kill somebody

77
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,400
and then spend my whole damn life in a

78
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,840
six by nine and that's always been my

79
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,239
biggest

80
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,239
biggest biggest concern of why i've

81
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,280
isolated myself and you know i'm in

82
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,280
rural northern

83
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,439
humboldt county you know i'm not down in

84
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,519
la i'm not in san diego

85
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,519

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,719
four hours

88
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,639
tops in these cities i've seen it he can

89
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,439
last like four hours tops and i don't

90
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,899

91
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,000
you know that's hard it it's

92
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,640
[Music]

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,280
and why i love colin so much is i

94
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,000
understand

95
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,759
his choice of being out in nature

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
because that's how i healed myself was

97
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,318
having my hands in the dirt my feet

98
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,239
barefoot on the ground and working

99
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,919
mother ganja with my hands and learning

100
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,519
to love her and appreciate her for what

101
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,679
she really is and i

102
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,719
and why i address it with people this is

103
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,360
a sacred

104
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,799
sacred plant this is not this is not

105
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
some kind of

106
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,120
it's been demonized for only about 80

107
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,958
frickin years is the part that pisses me

108
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,519
off i'm generationally a seven you know

109
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,680
i was a young man in the 70s so i saw

110
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,120
this plant being demonized

111
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,519
in night you know that people don't get

112
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,158
it though the law only goes back the

113
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,039
last

114
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,280
freaking schedule one thing that's 1970.

115
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,878
that's only 50 fripping years ago that's

116
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,719
not like that was long ago when you talk

117
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:53,438
about a plant that's been used on this

118
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,759
planet for

119
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:58,079
a conservatively six to seven thousand

120
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,840
years concern

121
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,760
you know i'm seeing all kinds of crazy

122
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,959
documentation now i read an article the

123
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,158
other day where they were going back

124
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,400
into biblical times

125
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,560
and finding the plant on altars that

126
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,280
goes back before christ was born you

127
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,280
know so there's

128
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,878
there's all these things that and me

129
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,239
personally i'm going to get way off on

130
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,518
under tangent here but i believe the

131
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,439
anointed one was

132
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,040
anointed with holy cannabis oil and

133
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,918
that's how i look at it

134
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,439
i believe that myself as well so and i'm

135
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,439
glad you brought that up because one of

136
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,879
the things that i do preach all the time

137
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,560
is the fact

138
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:33,600
that this plant was here way before

139
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,079
anyone of us that is alive today

140
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,960
and will continue to be even after we're

141
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,680
gone

142
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,239
but there's nothing that we can do about

143
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,120
that

144
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,759
but actually embrace it in our humanity

145
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,000
and be

146
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,199
able to make this world a better place

147
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,680
not only

148
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,319
as in the person as medicine that you

149
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
use

150
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:56,319
but also um as an eco-friendly crop that

151
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:01,199
can potentially save our environment

152
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,199
and give us all a better quality of life

153
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,439
you don't have it's not about

154
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,960
consumption it's about the potential

155
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,639
and how it can actually in essence i

156
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,359
know it may sound out there but save the

157
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,360
world

158
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,960
there's so many industries that right

159
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,080
now if they use

160
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,879
the fiber for for the plant then

161
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,560
it it would take it to to a next level

162
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,839
and at the same time

163
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,319
help uh the rest of the world

164
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,560
so you know this is we should not take

165
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,038
this lightly that's that's usually how i

166
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,038
preach it

167
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,319
amen yeah i i think i think it's kind of

168
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,959
and i guess part of what i've realized

169
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,360
is i would have been about you know i

170
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,758
got out of the traditional market after

171
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,080
my military time and i just i focused on

172
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,160
just

173
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,319
underground i mean i was literally pre-2

174
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,320
000 you couldn't find me i was in a

175
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,360
four-by-five little box in willits

176
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,959
california

177

you know and if anybody's ever been to

178
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,359
willis before that is a

179
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,199
weed community that nothing else really

180
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,240
pushes that little town anymore other

181
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,319
than the plant

182
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,840
and that's kind of again that whole

183
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,240
neigh that whole community is here you

184
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,560

and traveled the world i've come

189
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,080
back to this area and retired here and

190
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,918
been in this craft

191
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,758
for decades and decades now and it's

192
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,719
like watching where it's

193
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,038
morphed from back when i first got into

194
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,199
it

195
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,519
to where it's transitioned about 10 or

196
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,120
15 years ago when i you know i love

197
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,879
these youngsters ago i've been in it

198
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,360
since it was legal it's like you haven't

199
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,759
done

200
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,400
shit you know you got into a game after

201
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,000
we forged with our blood sweat and tears

202
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,918
jail time personally i've been throwing

203
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,279
in the been locked up for

204
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,198
you know they took five years of my life

205
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,159
back in the mid 80s guys you know over

206
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,000
this plant

207
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,439
three quarters of an ounce that's the

208
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,918
crazy part of this

209
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,759
in 33 states that's a ticketable or

210
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,359
misdemeanor offense

211
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,960
and they threw me in freaking prison

212
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,038
over it you know and it's like i look at

213
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,680
it now where how it shifted so much it's

214
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,598
like

215
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:09,038
there's so me it's the love of the plant

216
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:11,120
what it does how it helps us all

217
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,318
regardless of how you use it don't you

218
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,079
don't have to use

219
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,439
do it the way i do it do it the way that

220
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,399
it works for you i have friends that

221
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,399
i've worked with from

222
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,560
childhood epilepsy to a buddy i'm

223
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,638
helping with crohn's disease right now

224
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,120
and i assure you my partner with crohn's

225
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,120
is not using the plant to get high

226
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,639
he's juicing the freaking green leaves

227
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,120
making smoothies out of him he's

228
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,759
drinking it internally because of the

229
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,680
all the the the high medicinal value

230
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,919
that the whole plant has that's

231
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,680
again that's where this thing what i

232
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,478
realized a couple years ago because i

233
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,160
wish

234
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:43,839
dr sue was here and maybe we could get

235
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
ethan in on one of these conversations

236
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,598
in the future

237
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,439
but this is a point where that we've

238
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,519
taken old hippie you know

239
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,199

240
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,878

241
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,720

243
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,599

245
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:02,878

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,639

247
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,039
lazy man's game you know

248
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,199
it is the ones that are just their true

249
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,038
true craft professional cannabis growers

250
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,680
in the emerald triangle

251
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,038
what cam preaches what i preach what we

252
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,280
do as a craft

253
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,639
it comes out in our flower quality and

254
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,038
that's what i tell i mean

255
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,879
again i'm going to shut up and let colin

256
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,800
can speak firsthand brother you you know

257
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,759
you've smoked my flowers before cam you

258
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,319
smoked my flowers

259
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,240
oh yeah they're wonderful well we also

260
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,879
need to get rid of this differentiation

261
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,278
between

262
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,479
recreational and medicinal it's all

263
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,278
therapeutic

264
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,320
and it's been used for you know all of

265
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,439
human history

266
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,159
as a food and fiber and fuel and a

267
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,959
medicine

268
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,679
and and a way to become spiritual in our

269
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,359
own way and

270
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,120
it's only been like you said the last 80

271
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,959
years that we've been without this

272
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,799
an interesting thing and i'm not saying

273
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:56,000
causation correlation

274
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,439
but we have had forever that um it's

275
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,879
only in the last several decades that

276
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,720
we're starting to see these autoimmune

277
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,320
diseases we're starting to see allergies

278
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,120
we're starting to see these things

279
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,720
where our bodies attack themselves and

280
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,600
we don't really have a written record of

281
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,240
something like that

282
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,920
previously but we've also had uh

283
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,959
cannabinoids in our diet for all of

284
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,360
human history

285
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,879
and yeah i can hear my dad saying well i

286
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,839
never touched it my grandfather never

287
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,879
touched it i was like

288
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,040
no but your livestock ate feral hemp if

289
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,200
your life stops eating feral hemp

290
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,958
and your chickens are eating the seeds

291
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,879
and your goats are eating it so you're

292
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,879
getting cannabinoids through your milk

293
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,120
through your dairy through your meat

294
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,399
from that and acidic cannabinoids in the

295
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,360
raw form are

296
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,360
very effective at much smaller doses to

297
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,120
find that homeostasis in our body and so

298
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,800
i think we're having to re-learn what

299
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,839
we've forgotten throughout all human

300
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,519
history

301
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,440
and you were talking about uh you know

302
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,639
finding biblical evidence

303
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,920
uh then uh what was it uh exodus 30

304
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,838
23 it talks about the holy anointing oil

305
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,079
well there was a mistranslation in the

306
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,959
early text of the bible in a septuagint

307
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,800
where they changed

308
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:05,039
calamus to cannabosin or vice versa

309
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,359
and there is references all throughout

310
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,360
the bible

311
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,600
by how much cannabis how many shekels it

312
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,240
costs to put it in the holy anointing

313
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,320
oil

314
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,519
and so if you're seeing you know ancient

315
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,600
things about jesus

316
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,440
bringing sight to the blind or he's

317
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,320
healing leprosy or he's casting out

318
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,800
demons

319
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,720
well if you have ocular pressure you're

320
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,399
going to be blind with glaucoma and if

321
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,560
you're anointed with cannabis oil

322
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,759
reducing the ocular pressure you get

323
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,919
sight to the blind

324
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,600
leprosy which covered all kinds of skin

325
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,519
conditions but if you put a topical

326
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
ointment of acidic cannabinoids even

327
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,799
decarboxylated cannabinoids

328
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,720
on any kind of dermatitis or or

329
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,958
some sort of skin condition it heals

330
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,040
fairly quickly so healing leprosy

331
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,359
children or people with epilepsy having

332
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,199
seizures could absolutely look like

333
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,360
being possessed by a demon

334
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,879
give them raw acidic cannabinoid whole

335
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,639
plant wonderful goodness

336
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,159
and you'll see a reduction in seizures

337
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,600
or casting out demons

338
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,958
now i'm not saying that's exactly what

339
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,399
it is but you know you got to look at

340
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,000
all the evidence and where we've come

341
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,759
from and all the altars

342
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,480
where they were burning seeds they were

343
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,319
burning this as part of a spirituality

344
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,560
but we've only had 80 years of

345
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,600
misinformation disinformation

346
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,879
propaganda and bullshit and we've got 80

347
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,000
years

348
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,439
in 80 years yeah in only 80 years that's

349
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,919
what people don't get it's like this is

350
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,640
only since the late the early 1930s that

351
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,319
this has all

352
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,039
changed this hasn't even been in a 100

353
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,720
year time period you know and i and

354
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,759
and again i get i get it i just don't

355
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,399
understand it and

356
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,319
you know it might to get it part is it's

357
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,399
all about greed and it's all about

358
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,480
corruption and control okay and what

359
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,919
we've realized now what cam hit it

360
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,600
totally on the head

361
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,039
and joanne and that colony i know you

362
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,920
guys know this too

363
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,799
we're talking about a plant that is food

364
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,639
medicine

365
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:56,479
fiber fuel rubber concrete

366
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,799
all these things all these industries

367
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,399
that it spills into now it's why they

368
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,639
it's greed they want to keep it

369
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,360
demonized so that people stay away from

370
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,120
it

371
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,360
you know i'm glad to see that we got

372
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,278
industrial hemp out of that loop and put

373
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,399
back into a textile that it could be

374
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,320
used as

375
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,839
and again breeders that want to breed

376
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,879
that thread and go

377
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,639
into cbd specific strains for

378
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,799
research and development for medical

379
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,000
applications to do that you know

380
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:26,479
i'm totally glad to see that that

381
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,679
happens and it keeps going that way you

382
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,320
know for me

383
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:32,078
and then for cam and and you guys too

384
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,440
because you guys use the plan and i know

385
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,120
what what colin

386
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,120
you know what his threat is and how what

387
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,519
he preaches and follows and i believe

388
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,000
that

389
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,720
in colin's mission so much it's beyond

390
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,399
words you know

391
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,759
i believe in colin's mission so much

392
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,720
that i drove down

393
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,720
750 miles one way two years ago and

394
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,560
brought my flowers down for his birthday

395
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,200
just to go hang out with him

396
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,239
okay and that's what my connection to

397
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,800
him is and

398
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,320
and him like a lot of people don't know

399
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,799
he literally knows where i

400
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,079
live you know in just when i told him

401
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,759
where i live he's got all my yeah that's

402
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:07,359
where i want to retire to i

403
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:09,519
you know that's kind of how we are drawn

404
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,560
together and i know colin's backstory

405
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
and he knows mine

406
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,759
and again we shared a similar path of

407
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,160

408
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,159

00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,078
my mission and what i'm doing is just i

501
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,360
want this information that we're having

502
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,399
these discussions

503
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,720
i want the people to be able to hear

504
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,320
this information because you know you

505
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,079
guys have been doing this for

506
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,680
decades there's people before you that

507
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,879
have been doing it as well this is

508
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:32,319
nothing new this information um

509
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:36,159
has been here like we said you mentioned

510
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:40,079
biblical times potentially back then um

511
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:43,360
this was utilized to help people

512
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:45,679
so as far as me yes um as a military

513
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,480
service member i had my issues

514
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,159
almost lost my life as well um and

515
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,440
cannabis saved me

516
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:57,278
after i got out where i was lost um

517
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,639
with ptsd anxiety um from

518
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:03,278
an accident that i suffered a concussion

519
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,160
lost the english language for almost 20

520
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,199
minutes

521
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:11,439
um then got out and

522
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:13,038
was in a dark cloud in my head that i

523
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,199
didn't know what to do

524
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,119
fortunately and randomly met somebody

525
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,798
who introduced me to cannabis

526
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,798
for medicinal purposes which honestly

527
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,798
it was meant to be because i'm pretty

528
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:25,759
sure based on my background you know

529
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,400
growing up

530
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,160
christianity you know and being drilled

531
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,120
that cannabis is a drug

532
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,080
and you already know the the narrative

533
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,558
there

534
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,759
um if it was introduced as something

535
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,960
like we're doing it

536
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,519
for fun likely i may have

537
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,519
not gone that route but i met a grower

538
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,319
like you guys who takes this very

539
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,359
seriously

540
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,918
that understand that whether you do this

541
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,879
you know when you sit on the couch just

542
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,320
or

543
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,360
because you are um looking to cure

544
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:02,720
to cure your cancer get through chemo or

545
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:05,119
something like that it's medicinal um

546
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,960
in in because at the end of the day

547
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,599
we're doing it to feel better to get to

548
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,160
a better

549
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,359
mental state or physical or emotional

550
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,880
for that matter

551
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:17,678
um so in that introduction um

552
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,120
i felt so much better like almost

553
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,320
immediately

554
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:26,000
mentally after three years

555
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:28,240
of being in that cloud and

556
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,200
i decided that i would make this my

557
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,839
mission you know

558
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,080
to to battle the misinformation because

559
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,399
then i started doing my own research and

560
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,960
one thing led to the next and then

561
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,559
you know the whole um if if we were

562
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,759
talking touching back on

563
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:48,798
what doc was saying here greed and just

564
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,839
uh business you know people

565
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,759
wanting to destroy other industries

566
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,279
obviously cannabis is something that

567
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,519
people can grow at home

568
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,440
if you have land you can grow cannabis

569
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:03,519
and help a lot of people

570
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,160
so i feel like people back in the day

571
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,639
you know we have the paper industry we

572
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,798
have

573
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,320
the plastics industry we have all these

574
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,839
other industries

575
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,159
that wanted to make money and this crop

576
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,839
is

577
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:21,759
cheaper and and to to grow and it grows

578
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:25,759
faster um it was just a

579
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:28,000
agreed you know in capitalism that

580
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,440
created that narrative that cannabis was

581
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,240
bad obviously you know

582
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,679
we cannot deny there was some racist

583
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,798
undertone as well

584
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,720
in denying all of that so

585
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:39,918
it's about we're in the era of

586
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,679
information

587
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,880
so i think with all the technology that

588
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,559
we have right now

589
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,799
and all the true anecdotes of real

590
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,160
people like yourselves like myself that

591
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,519
we can say hey

592
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,360
i am alive and this happened to me and i

593
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,639
have all this evidence

594
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,240
and i am not the only one um so that's

595
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,840
like what we're doing with with

596
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,000
veterans walk and talk with cannabis

597
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,319
synergy obviously you guys

598
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,279
and i think the fact that we can come

599
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,240
together

600
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,319
to have these conversations and then um

601
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,038
share it with our respective communities

602
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,000
i feel like

603
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,798
because we're not lying you know this is

604
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,640
actually

605
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:25,359
the fact um i think that

606
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,520
we it's gonna spread so i'm i'm very

607
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,678
hopeful for the near future

608
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,158
that we can um continue to have this

609
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,280
conversations get more people involved

610
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,360
you know um the the in in other

611
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,480
in all the areas whether it's science

612
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,839
whether it is

613
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,400
um entertainment education business

614
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,359
um cannabis pretty much touches on

615
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,640
everything

616
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,479
um and we we have so much opportunity

617
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,960
and i'm i'm glad that we're seizing it

618
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,599
so

619
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,240

like discovering that if i breed in this

646

648
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,200
or

649
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:56,079
sleep or whatever and you you came back

650
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,519
from what it was vietnam i assume right

651
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,798
well i'm the end of vietnam

652
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,798
i'm the very tail end of it

653
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,360
i'm considered a cold war green beret

654
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,279
what they call a cold war commando i'm

655
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,399
an unknown variable and have we have

656
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,558
been up until about

657
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,240
2013 i was an unknown variable in the

658
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:15,119
military system

659
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,960
most military quite honestly 99.9

660
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,678
doesn't even know what we did because of

661
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,880
such this

662
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,880
that behind the freaking scenes

663
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,799
yeah so long story short i did

664
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,640
extractions and then from extractions i

665
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,558
moved over to europe where i was doing

666
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,720
working in northern africa

667
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,200
working in all all across europe

668
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,558
fighting what we consider the

669
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,720
uh red menace the communist bloc

670
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:39,678
that whole part of it i did two

671
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,360
different times

672
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,679
when i returned from that i basically

673
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,759
got kicked out in in

674
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:50,400
fort dix new jersey as a

675
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:52,319
22 year old not quite 23 year old

676
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,840
completely messed up young man that

677
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,079
didn't have a clue because everything

678
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,519
that i believed to be true and

679
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,240
fighting for truth justice in the

680
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,679
american way when i got

681
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,798
overseas realized that it was a bunch of

682
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,798
bullshit

683
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,319
after a few years of time it was really

684
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,639
hard for me to

685
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,678
get beyond i was real angry when i came

686
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,919
back you know and

687
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,720
and why i isolated myself so much

688
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,120
because it was so

689
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,159
s it was bullshit you know i knew it was

690
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,038
bullshit

691
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,039
i saw it it it crushed me you know it

692
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,558
really crushed me on a spiritual level

693
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,599
and an emotional level

694
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:28,079
and then to lose brothers in arms in in

695
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,279
behind the scenes as in a thing in 79

696
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:32,240
called eagle claw

697
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:34,079
desert one was the attempt to remove the

698
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,359

700
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,479
building

701

702
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,319
first joint task force ever for the

703
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:47,599

706
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,798
160th soar off of that the 75th rangers

all kinds of crazy shit stuff that

709
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,798
happens within the navy now that was

710
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,200
more from that original

711
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,839
mission where nobody even knew about it

712
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,200
you know

713
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:08,240
we crashed in the desert and lost

714
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,840
a half a dozen brothers and i personally

715
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,200
was on a team that was on the ground and

716
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,240
we had packed in

717
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,960
stealthy from freaking pakistan you know

718
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,798
it's like

719
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,960
to get where we were to be outside of

720
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,720
tehran and then shit blow up and be told

721
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,400
that we were on our own

722
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,200
and nobody knew we were there and

723
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,798
basically get your own fucking ass out

724
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,400
it's it's a it's a tough thing to

725
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:33,839
swallow you know to be to be

726
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,840

794
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,600
i'm at specifically

795
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,119
just happens to be the heart of the

796
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,038
emerald triangle you know where i

797
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,879
where i grew up and where i found my

798
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,839
sanity and what i consider my home in my

799
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,960
sanctuary you know it's like

800
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,720
that moment in time when i was it

801
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,840
actually was in right after i got out of

802
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,519
prison and i

803
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,119
was the only one that was able to take

804
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,278
care of my mother who was going through

805
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,000
breast cancer and i became her primary

806
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,519
caregiver for about 16 months

807
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,679
and that was me taking her back to

808
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,079
chemotherapy every day and

809
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,000
dealing with her double mastectomy

810
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,599
taking my mother that i love dearly and

811
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,519
taking her in and you know getting this

812
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,199
luck coming back at the end after chemo

813
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,319
and having to deal with her being sick

814
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,960
anyway this old man back then was a

815
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,599
young man

816
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,240
i decided to take old school hippie

817
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,639
therapy

818
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,720
and you know we worked where she ate

819
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,720
about a quarter of a brownie

820
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,798
you know and it helped me get her

821
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,399
through her being sick partying keeping

822
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,558
her appetite up

823
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,319
and you know a quarter of brownie when

824
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:18,558
she went in and a quarter when she came

825
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,319
out

826
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,000
about a happy brownie anyway this was

827
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,918
just how i started getting into the

828
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,720
medical application of this thing

829
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:31,200
and then for me for my own damage was

830
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,319
i didn't even really know what it was to

831
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,080
answer peter's question i didn't even

832
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,639
know what it was quite honestly guys it

833
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,278
was

834
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,278
i just knew that and you guys get it

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,000
know it's like

969
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:06,798
in 2001 september the 11th happened

970
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,679
everybody shut down and internalized the

971
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:09,759
market

972
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,320

973
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,919

974
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,839

thousand dollars a pound of coffee to

976
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,720
under three thousand dollars a pound and

977
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,038
it was still

978
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,038
the three to three three to thirty two

979
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:24,720
hundred hours a year it was to take to

980
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,679
make the damn thing get done

981
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,159
full sun this is before light depth you

982
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,798
know

983
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,600
this was before greenhouses full sun

984
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:33,278
outdoor

985
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,038
just the way mother nature and god

986
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:38,079
almighty intended it to be

987
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:41,038
you know 20 footers 16 foot wide 20 feet

988
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:45,199
tall that kind of crazy stuff right

989
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:48,079
that's how i anyway my old lampard and i

990
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,759
between 03 and 05 the market tumbled

991
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,639
tumbled bad from

992
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:54,319
33 000 or so where i believe is a fair

993
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,919
marketable price where a farmer can make

994
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,278
a living is about three thousand dollars

995
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,360
a pound wholesale that's a

996
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:01,038
reasonable rate there's a lot of money

997
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:01,519
left at a three thousand dollar price

998
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,278
point

999
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,720
a lot of money left for a retailer to

1000
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:06,079
make a killing when they're charging

1001
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,760
brothers and sisters

1002
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:12,878
25 30 35 40 50 a gram

1003
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,839
i know my flowers on the east coast on

1004
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,398
both ends of it

1005
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,838
and they get 35 to 50 a gram for my

1006
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,078
frickin flowers

1007
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,159
it's ridiculous okay i'm getting way off

1008
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,200
another tangent my point is

1009
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,878
this portion of reading specifically you

1010
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,358
guys is this is what i've been working

1011
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,199
on

1012
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:34,559
for me specifically for two decades

1013
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:37,598
you know threes 03 03-06

1014
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,358
i got was getting out of the market well

1015
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,480
we grew so much weed it took me three

1016
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,319
years to get rid of it guys

1017
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,838
you know and i just couldn't do it

1018
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,480
anymore because it was the same i was

1019
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:51,119
working 12 months out of the year

1020
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,639
i got my old school and people don't

1021
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,559
even know that you know

1022
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,240
my old plant was from a buddy of mine

1023
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,960
called old dave

1024
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:01,679
okay old dave who has been gone for over

1025
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,920

1026
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:07,118

1027
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,280

1029
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,560
of my mentors with long story short

1030
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,480
my skunk og plant that would just lay

1031
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:19,119
your ass out it still does it puts you

1032
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,079
on a couch in about 20 minutes

1033
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,039
my friend that very dear friend of mine

1034
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,519
that's

1035
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,199
a blue dream the creator of blue dream

1036
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:30,400
she gifted me

1037
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,598
a plant of female and i took as

1038
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,119
something to do because i was

1039
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,880
wasn't growing and she said you need

1040
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,599
something to do here smoke this

1041
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,079
blue dream's a beautiful cerebral smoke

1042
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,920
it's really good for clearing your head

1043
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,240
finding your balance it doesn't put you

1044
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,960
on the couch i don't know all the

1045
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:47,519
cbd thc but i do know what the effects

1046
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,720
are

1047
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:53,599
okay so her plant with

1048
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,559
my old day plant which i call my og

1049
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,680
skunk

1050
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,599
okay what was called the mendo skunk

1051
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:00,879
cam probably gets it because he's old

1052
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,280
enough to get it he knows what the

1053
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,680
mendocino peace plant was all about

1054
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,320
you know the mendo skunk that's one of

1055
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,480
my legacies you know i'm a creator of

1056
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,119
team of creators on a lot of strains

1057
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,519
that are

1058
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,280
unknown the unknown breeders you know

1059
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:18,000
the green mountain growers group

1060
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,119
before you guys even before cam was born

1061
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,159
you know it's like

1062
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,240
these as my 40 year old son says to me

1063
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:26,000
you mean before me dad and it's like yes

1064
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,118
i'm before you

1065
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,880
so that being said that

1066
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,960
plant that combination and 13 14 years

1067
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,440
of breeding is what's releasing now is

1068
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,480
my what i call my blue skunk strain

1069
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,079
and that is a very much created for

1070
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,119
post-traumatic stress

1071
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,039
for with physical damage this is

1072
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,039
something you can smoke that clears your

1073
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,679
head you can smoke it or vape it clears

1074
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:51,599
your head

1075
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,358
clears your consciousness and in about

1076
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,280
20 minutes later all of a sudden you go

1077
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:58,639
oh my shoulder doesn't hurt anymore man

1078
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,359
and my back isn't aching anymore

1079
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:03,118
now this is just me what's happened in

1080
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,279
the last two years is me taking

1081
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,160
that plant and getting it out to people

1082
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,320
across our state and across the country

1083
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,559
and getting the same results back from

1084
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,680
veteran brothers and sisters going

1085
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:17,358
i'm getting the same results and now in

1086
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:20,000
the last since the end of

1087
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:22,159
last year since the emerald cup now

1088
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,719
breeders best is my breeding company

1089
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,480
they're

1090
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:26,559
they're helping me with patenting and

1091
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,280
branding and and that puts me in the

1092
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,799
same

1093
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:33,280
rooms with ethan russo the neurologist

1094
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,960
cannabis guy in the freaking country

1095
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,640
you know it puts me in the same room

1096
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,720
with sue sisley the

1097
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,159
woman that's leading the fight for

1098
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:42,159
post-traumatic stress

1099
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,000
therapy cannabis therapy for veterans

1100
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:47,279
she's the one suing

1101
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,559
the va on our behalf right now you know

1102
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,200
and them to me

1103
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,239
they want to be where i'm at that's what

1104
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,838
i got incept

1105
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,078
in over in the earlier part of the year

1106
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,838
was sue coming and searching me out with

1107
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,119
dale so they could sit down with me you

1108
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:01,119
know because they know that they're

1109
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,358
hearing about what my flowers are doing

1110
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,760
and that's what i'm trying to get

1111
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,519
from this obscurity that i'm in this

1112
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,720
unknown variable i'm in not and i don't

1113
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,400
even care about me

1114
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,000
it is not about money to me this is

1115
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,200
about helping men and women helping

1116
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,039
brothers and sisters and

1117
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:20,159
arms specifically military veterans

1118
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:23,279
first responders anybody in

1119
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,159
crisis that's what my threat is and i'm

1120
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,880
not again

1121
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,639
i get it yes it's recreational yes you

1122
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,280
can but that's not my thread

1123
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,000
my agreement with my breeding company is

1124
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,040
i can stay

1125
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,400
conservatively stay 70 or more in the

1126
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,639
medical field

1127
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,720
only 20 to 30 percent of my flowers will

1128
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,719
ever hit the recreational market and

1129
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:44,799
very very on a limited scale

1130
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,879
i want to keep it in that thread i don't

1131
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,519
want it to go that way

1132
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,440
you know personally for me it's about

1133
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:51,759
the quality of the flower it's about

1134
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,000
that

1135
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,599
initial intake you know it's like

1136
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,559
something again where cam and i

1137
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,280

1138
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:01,440
long people

1139
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,359
can't even get how long we cure our

1140
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,960
flowers you know they don't even

1141
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,960

1142
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,920

1143
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,639

1148
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,440
how to look at plants and you know how

1149
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:25,118
you know how do we bridge that gap you

1150
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,440
know how do we get it out where

1151
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,119
well i'm hoping this is a first step now

1152
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,679
that you know you and i are in the same

1153
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,240
realm

1154
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,000
it's like we have you have act sister

1155
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:35,519
you have access to a grower in humboldt

1156
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,639
county now

1157
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:42,000
i can't wait to go over there

1158
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:43,679
no because i feel like this is this is

1159
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,639
all in enlightenment i feel like we're

1160
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:49,919
all in alignment in our mission

1161
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:53,598
and obviously coming together would just

1162
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,320
give it more power and reach more people

1163

1166
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:06,960
like like i said earlier we can't take

1167
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:10,000
this slightly like if we have

1168
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,079
um this information that can help so

1169
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,679
many people you know that you guys are

1170
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,720
putting into work

1171
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:19,838
intentionally you know to solve

1172
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:22,480
all of our problems i mean even if

1173
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,039
we just talk to veterans like we are

1174
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,480
doing

1175
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,159
such a service um through our community

1176
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,119
to our people that

1177
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,078
we know what it is in so many levels you

1178
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,039
know

1179
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,000
you don't have you didn't for a person

1180
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,400
like

1181
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,039
in the military i know people that

1182
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,160
didn't get blown up didn't get blown by

1183
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,039
air aircraft jet blast like i did for

1184
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:48,000
instance

1185
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:48,559
but they went through other stuff that

1186
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,920
is

1187
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:54,400
traumatic like it's trauma you know and

1188
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,400
uh where they're everywhere

1189
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,200
absolutely and like you said every

1190
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,119
military person i believe it's everybody

1191
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,719
you know even if you were a desk jockey

1192
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,599
somewhere man or you know or you were

1193
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:07,519
just looking at the screen

1194
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,880
okay i i'm only saying this because i

1195
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:09,920
have female

1196
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,000
you know i have daughters that are

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,159
veterans you know i just know what kind

1198
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,159
of harassment there was you know i just

1199
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:17,679
understand that kind of nonsense you

1200
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:19,598
know and that's the part

1201

1214
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,000
community you know

1215
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,160
you're doing it i know cam's doing it

1216
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,719
colin's doing it every damn week man i

1217
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,199
see what

1218
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,879
what walking talk does all across the

1219
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,159
country the tremendous things that he's

1220
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,920
doing just

1221
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:59,679
reaching brothers and sisters in crisis

1222
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,280
and literally in the trenches

1223
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:03,199
that's the part that i love about what

1224
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,880
colin does so much it isn't talking the

1225
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:06,960
talk he is literally out there

1226
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,838
seriously walking walking in the walk

1227
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,280
yeah i'm walking right behind him

1228
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:17,199
he's definitely leading a lot of us

1229
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,960
so so just quickly doc i think you

1230
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:20,960
you touched on a couple of things that i

1231
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,559
think are critical i mean one you were

1232
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,880
kind of like

1233
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,480
learning on the fly about something you

1234
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,960
didn't even know about

1235
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,719
like you know i mean i think you you had

1236
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,920
an intuitive sense that this was a

1237
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,399
medicine

1238
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,480
but then you started you know breeding

1239
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,400
with intent in certain directions

1240
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,159
towards you know easing your physical

1241
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,240
pain your mental pain

1242
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,078
you know different chemo types that

1243
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:46,959
maybe you started to

1244
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,480
realize oh my god like this super knock

1245
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,679
you out on the couch

1246
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,199
is great for x but it's horrible for y

1247
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:55,440
and i'm gonna breed something else

1248
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,759
that's great for y but maybe not good

1249
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,920
for

1250
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,920
x um it's what i'm doing now peter

1251
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,680
it's i mean it's my focus now you know i

1252
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,280
have more science behind it now and i

1253
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,039
can actually you know i can go in and

1254
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,920
look at the structural makeup of it and

1255
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:12,239
go okay

1256
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,079
i'm looking for cbg or cb cbd v

1257
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:16,000
now which is really what i'm tripping

1258
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,920
looking for okay

1259
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,199
honestly what i'm looking for so that's

1260
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,358
good that's where this right

1261
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,199
but but but but back in the day you

1262
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:26,960
didn't have that vocabulary

1263
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:30,559
at all cbg cbn

1264
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,880
like uh whatever and so it's kind of

1265
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:35,440
it's interesting once you start to gain

1266
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,160
that vocabulary and meet people like

1267
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,000
ethan russo or sue sisley and

1268
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,399
you know i feel like now we're fast

1269
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,679
forwarded in a moment where

1270
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:49,440
you're armed with kind of a team of

1271
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,879
scientists behind you who can articulate

1272
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,119
what your

1273
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,079
all of you are seeing anecdotally i

1274
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,800
think that's the big

1275
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,839
thing here is you know pharmaceutical

1276
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,400
medicine is kind of

1277
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,400
top down a company spends a billion

1278
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,960
dollars to get something approved for a

1279
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,720
specific disease or condition whereas

1280
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,280
cannabis is kind of bottom up where you

1281
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:09,439
have

1282
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,440
you know thousands or tens of thousands

1283
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,920
of caregivers

1284
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,679
noticing things with themselves and

1285
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,079
their friends

1286
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:20,159
and initially not having a way to

1287
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,079
verbally articulate it but i think now

1288
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,759
kind of the vocabulary is coming

1289
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:29,280
and and and uh can can you and cam

1290
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,680
just quickly touch on what happens when

1291
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,680
you

1292
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:38,000
cure flower for a longer period of time

1293
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:42,078
in terms of medicinal effects okay

1294
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,679
sure uh here this is again this goes

1295
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,119
back to what peter just was talking

1296
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,960
about this goes back to what

1297
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,119
and something that i practice and i know

1298
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,599
cam practices and most of us here in the

1299
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:54,079
triangle practice is craft

1300
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,960
okay what i realized a couple of years

1301
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,640
ago

1302
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,240
and this is what we need to do as a

1303
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,838
community and another thing we need to

1304
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,919
embrace sister and something that you

1305
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:04,318
can do and colin can do is we can teach

1306
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,039
out that white white

1307
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:07,358
dabs are not necessarily anything other

1308
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:10,880
than

1309
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:14,480
immature flowers okay

1310
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:17,280
the the the rich full spectrum plants

1311
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,159
are amber in color those that gold

1312
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,680
browns

1313
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:23,118
rich and what i realized was and i was

1314
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:24,639
talking to a

1315
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,240
mutual friend of collins of mine because

1316
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,920
i asked him what the hell man

1317
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:29,439
you know where do i need to be if i'm

1318
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,760
going to go into that market with my

1319
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,159
flowers and he wants full spectrum

1320
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,960
and he's literally told me this word for

1321
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,879
word

1322
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,559
and and uh calling it was blaze brother

1323
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,318
i was talking to blaze on the phone and

1324
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:44,799
he told me this and he said

1325
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:45,519
that growers are harvesting anywhere

1326
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,480
from two

1327
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:49,119
three and even four weeks early to keep

1328
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,519
the

1329
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,358
pistols white and the trichomes white

1330
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:55,199
and creamy so that when they crush it

1331
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:56,639
and smash it and turn it into

1332
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,199
whatever the hell they're turning it

1333
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:00,159
into it stays white and creamy and hence

1334
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:02,000
the visual

1335
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:03,838
impression is oh my god it's so white

1336
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,920
and clean it must be the best

1337
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,759
that's like the farthest thing from the

1338
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,280
truth of the matter really is because

1339
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,839
when you get into like

1340
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,000
rsos and fsos and full spectrum

1341
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,039
concentrates

1342
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,199
they're gold and rich and full and amber

1343
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:22,800
colors and what peter was alluding to i

1344
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,799
believe is what he was alluding to is

1345
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,119
when when i'm in the fill watching that

1346
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,800
i'm literally

1347
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,640
okay i'm taking 48 years of experience

1348
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,800
when i'm looking at my flowers in the

1349
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:37,358
field per se but i have a

1350
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,680
lighted microscope and a jeweler's loop

1351
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:42,880
in my freaking pocket man you know

1352
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:44,960
i only leave so much to sheer

1353
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,599
instinct i'm go back and even when i'm

1354
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,599
sure it's ripe i still go back in and

1355
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,200
oscilloscope everything i pop my little

1356
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,960
lighted microscope in there and look at

1357
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:55,838
the trichome heads and see

1358
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,639
you know in my six and b okay my rule of

1359
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:01,920
thumb

1360
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:05,118
60 to 65 70 clear 20 or so milky 10

1361
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,920
red and burnt off that's me is optimum

1362
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,000
cam that that's about identical to what

1363
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,559
we do as well

1364
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,358
you know so that what into what peter

1365
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:15,039
was talking about

1366
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,279
full spectrum you know how do we know

1367
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:20,880
when it's optimum that's what we go

1368
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,280
on most of the concentrate people that

1369
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,720
i've talked to

1370
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,160
and i talked to a couple of guys who are

1371
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:26,480
really good at their craft you know they

1372
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,199
have

1373
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,719
huge followings online they they produce

1374
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:31,199
lots and lots of material and they're

1375
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:32,558
really good

1376
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:34,480
and that's what they're telling me is

1377
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,200
that clear stuff that's the commercial

1378
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,159
stuff

1379
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:40,399
is being harvested way way early i think

1380
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,159
what we can do as a community and sister

1381
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,559
your platform and calling

1382
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,639
your platform brother is teach out that

1383
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,640
what full spectrum really looks like you

1384
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:50,960
know this is full spectrum

1385
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:52,000
full term look how golden amber it is

1386
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,079
look how beautiful this

1387
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,838
cult this patina is on this you know i

1388
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,359
have a sister that just sent me some

1389
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:59,358
of hers from the middle of the country

1390
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,358
over for me to look take a look at

1391
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:04,078
and it's brown as it can be and it is

1392
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:04,880
just delicious you know it smokes like

1393
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,079
heaven

1394
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,039
it is immediately just washes right over

1395
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,559
you you know

1396
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:14,880
and again another warrior veteran female

1397
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,800
badass grower that i know that's a rock

1398
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,559
star you know and sierra's just a

1399
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,640
freaking killing it man you know and i

1400
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,800
love what she does and that's just

1401
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,960
that's again her what she teaches out

1402
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,359
and what i teach out and cam and and i'm

1403
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,039
assuming you are sister and and brother

1404
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:31,199
carl and i assume you are as well you

1405
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:34,480
know about whole plant medicine

1406
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,799
and and and really what where it is for

1407
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,199
me

1408
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,400
personally is that's my main thread of

1409
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,679
trying to

1410
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,000
grow full term full spectrum

1411
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:46,078
that has is rich in everything across

1412
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,760
the board maybe high in some areas but

1413
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,160
rich in everything across the board

1414
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,240
because

1415
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:51,358
that what i believe is the closest way

1416
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,719
to heal ourselves

1417
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:56,480
naturally with it and

1418
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,000
joanne you said something and cam said

1419
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,480
something both about it about the you

1420
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,400
know we have

1421
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,639
cannabinoid receptors in our bodies you

1422
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,160
know it's like we're wired for this

1423
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,598
stuff to think that it's not supposed to

1424
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:08,078
be in our system it's just quite

1425
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,559
honestly ridiculous in today's

1426
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,280
scientific community medical community

1427
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,760
you know back

1428
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,680
and peter you said it earlier you know

1429
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,760
back in the 70s and 80s man

1430
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,759
we were outlaw you know we were

1431
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,680
underground nobody knew who the hell we

1432
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,520
were we only knew who each other were we

1433
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:25,838
didn't put our names on stuff we didn't

1434
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:27,199
advertise what we were growing

1435
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,880
you know you advertised what you were

1436
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:30,480
growing and you went to prison you know

1437
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,400
that's just the truth of the matter you

1438
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,318
know it's even happens now there's still

1439
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,920
red states in our union that if they

1440
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:37,920
advertise what they're doing they go to

1441
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,599
prison over it

1442
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,159
you know and it's like we're fortunate

1443
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,519
to be in this state of california

1444
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:47,679
why would why would like uh

1445
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,960
right now why do you think people are

1446
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:52,399
using the

1447
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,800
white stuff as opposed to letting it get

1448
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,838
the right color um ratio that you were

1449
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,160
speaking about

1450
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:02,558
um i feel like the white the the lighter

1451
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,719
color is what i predominantly see

1452
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,160
especially especially like in the legal

1453
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:08,480
markets actually

1454
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:09,358
that again that that is the commercial

1455
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,000
legal market

1456
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:12,799
that it is not crap what craft people do

1457
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,039
right

1458
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,559
it's it's it's it's harvested earlier

1459
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:18,480
and to answer his question

1460
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,200
and you said it too already joey you

1461
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,119
already said it sister greed

1462
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:25,118
grief and also like your education you

1463
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,440
can do it quicker you can turn more you

1464
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,400
can turn more volume over in the same 12

1465
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,240
months you know the 12

1466
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,000
same 12 months that cam and i would work

1467
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:33,919
in where we would try and do maybe three

1468
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
or four harvesters using the sun and

1469
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,480
maybe a little light augmentation

1470
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,440
doing a light depth outside and for what

1471
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,679
we do

1472
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,880
okay three or four times maybe in a year

1473
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:44,799
commercially

1474
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,960
every six weeks you know they're trying

1475
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,519
to get six seven harvests in a year

1476
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,679
because

1477
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,119
again it's about greed and not about the

1478
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:54,000
quality of the flower

1479
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:56,720
and i and sadly i believe now i'm not

1480
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,159
100 sure and i'm only going on by guys

1481
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,159
that practice the craft

1482
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:02,159
i'm not i'm a flower guy i'm not an

1483
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,719
extraction whiz i i

1484
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:07,118
you know the the guy that is that i have

1485
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:07,598
connections to is a great extraction guy

1486
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,519
that i

1487
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,359
did i ask information from and that's

1488
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:14,159
what he's telling me is

1489
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:15,920
you know quicker harvest quicker return

1490
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:17,920
less time in the ground

1491
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,318
you know more more more more more

1492
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,400
cheaper cheaper cheaper cheaper

1493
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:24,318
and we have that i mean we really have

1494
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,920
that we have that market that

1495
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:28,318
they ten dollars a gram they don't give

1496
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,880
a damn what it is they just want to get

1497
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,119
high

1498
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,119
that's not my thread that's not really

1499
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,800
cam's thread i don't think it's you guys

1500
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,079
have a newer thread either i get that

1501
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,480
that's out there

1502
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,240
but i believe what what you said what we

1503
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:44,000
what we need to do is we need to teach

1504
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:46,239
that that's not necessarily the best

1505
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,358
and we can also say best but we can also

1506
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:49,439
say different

1507
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:50,799
because uh when we look at the

1508
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,720
differences of those you also have the

1509
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,240
people who insist that you have to have

1510
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:57,118
flour that's over 20

1511
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:59,118
thc and all of the research and all of

1512
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,838
us know that use cannabis on a regular

1513
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,599
basis

1514
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:05,358
that some of the greatest strains are

1515
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:07,440
you know seven to 15 percent thc

1516
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:10,239
and so we're having to educate people

1517
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,358
that more thc is not the end all be all

1518
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:13,598
of the product

1519
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:15,440
and so and this comes back to where you

1520
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,280
were talking about full spectrum

1521
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,119
we have to define these terms for

1522
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,319
ourselves before other people's

1523
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,680
other people define them that have no

1524
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:25,279
business talking about it because they

1525
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,558
don't have the experience in it so we

1526
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,720
talking full spectrum

1527
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:31,599
of an industrial hemp are we talking

1528
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:33,439
full spectrum of an indoor grown clone

1529
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,359
that's harvested at a specific time are

1530
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,039
we talking about the full spectrum

1531
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:38,480
of a beautiful cannabis plant that was

1532
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,558
grown in full sun

1533
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,639
in full soil and allowed to go to the

1534
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,400
full term of its life expectancy

1535
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:46,480
being buffeted by the wind and being

1536
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,160
predated on by bugs and

1537
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,760
and deer so that they respond and

1538
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:50,639
produce more cannabinoids and more

1539
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,319
terpenes

1540
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:54,239
you know there's all different levels

1541
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:55,358
and so we have to start coming up with

1542
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,039
standardized

1543
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:58,960
definitions of these so people can

1544
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,400
understand what we're talking about

1545
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,480
and when you spend all that time

1546
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,800
outdoors making these beautiful plants

1547
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,838
that the most robust broad spectrum that

1548
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,519
you can

1549
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:08,880
the better that you take care of them

1550
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:10,639
post harvests

1551
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,318
that once you harvest them that's the

1552
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:13,759
halfway mark

1553
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:15,679
now you've got to start working on

1554
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,520
curing and making sure that you

1555
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:19,279
stabilize all those cannabinoids and all

1556
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:21,280
those terpenes that you allow them to

1557
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,119
develop to their full potential

1558
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,119
while degrading the things in the plant

1559
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:28,079
that we don't want like the chlorophyll

1560
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,760
so doc and i both do super long slow

1561
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,160
cures where we leave the flower

1562
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,400
untrimmed on the stick for months

1563
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:36,318
in a dark space that is climate

1564
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,039
controlled humidity temperature

1565
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:39,759
airflow and i don't like to trim them

1566
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:41,759
first i want

1567
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,880
all of those small sugar leaves to cover

1568
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,800
the trichomes

1569
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,240
and protect them like a cocoon and let

1570
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,119
them develop and

1571
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:50,719
and they'll it's like a fine wine or a

1572
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,440
fine tequila you know talk about the

1573
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,318
colors

1574
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,960
a blanco tequila is an un-aged tequila

1575
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:58,000
it's raw

1576
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,159
it's fresh it's young it's hoven

1577
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,440
but as you age the can of the tequila

1578
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:02,159
just like the cannabis it's going to

1579
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,000
develop more

1580
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,519
rich colors and you're going to get a

1581
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,559
reposado or a niejo

1582
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:10,000
style and the more that you allow the

1583
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,519
cannabis to cure the more it's going to

1584
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
develop into new things we're even

1585
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:14,000
discovering

1586
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:19,838
which is a prevalent a lot of handmade

1587
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:23,118
temple ball hashes or charas

1588
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:24,799
when you seal that hash in it still ages

1589
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,640
and converts i have flour

1590
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,559
you know i'm still smoking my pre-rolls

1591
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:29,039
from three years ago that are developed

1592
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,319
and they

1593
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:34,400
they've just become so much more robust

1594
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:36,239
but all of these parts of the plant that

1595
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,880
there's better things for better people

1596
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:42,558
somebody might need that that blonde

1597
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,200
uh rosin uh that's got a lot of thca or

1598
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,160
cbda or cbga the precursor acidic

1599
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:47,598
cannabinoids

1600
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:49,838
and then a lot of other people are going

1601
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,119
to need a more robust profile that has a

1602
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,039
lot more things in it

1603
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,358
because our endocannabinoid systems are

1604
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:57,119
extremely individual there's what

1605
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:59,039
what works for one of us won't work for

1606
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,200
another and so

1607
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:02,719
um we just need to make sure that

1608
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:06,000
everything that's going into the market

1609
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:08,959
is clean and tested and

1610
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,960
won't cause harm

1611
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:12,880
so yeah as someone who spends a lot of

1612
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:14,798
time testing different things that can

1613
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,160
heal because i'm a self-rehabilitated

1614
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:19,119
veteran

1615
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:21,118
i wear that badge of honor proudly and

1616
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,440
uh um

1617
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,039
with cannabis in particular and you know

1618
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,920
i don't want to get too into the weeds

1619
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:27,920
with it but

1620
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,079
you guys are hitting it on the head in

1621
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:34,240
such an important topic because

1622
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:36,559
for me for four years i have been trying

1623
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:38,399
craft cannabis to dispensary cannabis

1624
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,798
and everything in between

1625
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,599
and i can tell you wholeheartedly now

1626
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:45,199
that the past

1627
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:46,798
month every time i dab or take a bond

1628
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:50,639
load of a high thc

1629
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:54,400
cannabis every issue i have is worse

1630
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:57,598
my pain my depression my anger

1631
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,920
my sadness all is compounded and through

1632
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,519
my own personal research which i like to

1633
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,639
do on my own

1634
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:06,400
i have come to find that you know people

1635
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:08,639
with a proclivity to

1636
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,960
traumatic with traumatic brain injury in

1637
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:14,159
their past with ptsd with brain

1638
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,240
injury specifically the dopamine levels

1639
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:19,679
affected by thc

1640
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:22,558
can ultimately hinder your own

1641
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,399
body's ability to make this so what

1642
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,200
you're doing is you're spiking in and

1643
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,960
out

1644
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:29,118
and when you take that bond load you may

1645
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,679
feel a little bit of relief at first but

1646
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,039
four or five hours later your body is

1647
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,719
not producing the same

1648
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:36,960
levels of dopamine so then you're

1649
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:38,959
crashing and this was happening to me

1650
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,480
and that's why i'm off thc and i'm

1651
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,920
specifically just taking

1652
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,199
oils like fiddler's greens thc a acidic

1653
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,760
thc now

1654
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:49,199
and it has like night overnight i felt

1655
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,720
better overnight

1656
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:54,719
and um so it is scary to me and

1657
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:57,118
the problem with that is and i come from

1658
00:56:54,719 --> 00:57:00,719
the cannabis compassionate world

1659
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:02,960
is that um i have 200

1660
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,318
over 200 active members of veterans walk

1661
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,358
and talk throughout the nation

1662
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:10,639
who for one reason or another need

1663
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:12,639
cannabis to survive and when you

1664
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:14,480
are facing them and they're coming to

1665
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:17,199
your hikes and

1666
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,960
i have to try to provide for them on on

1667
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:20,558
a weekly basis when we're when we're

1668
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,440
really active and all three of you have

1669
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,119
hiked with us

1670
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,480
and all three of you have donated to

1671
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,920
veterans walk and talk

1672
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:31,119
and so you know the need is great what

1673
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:34,559
has happened now between the beauty

1674
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:36,079
and the elegance of what doc ray and cam

1675
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,359
do

1676
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:42,400
between that and dispensaries it has

1677
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:46,078
gotten completely convoluted with greed

1678
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:49,680
and what happens is you get 39

1679
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,079
cannabinoids um on the label when that

1680
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:52,719
means

1681
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:54,559
nothing to the average consumer and then

1682
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,919
you get up people

1683
00:57:54,559 --> 00:58:00,079
like myself who take the time to try

1684
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,599
every last product that they can

1685
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,119
possibly find because

1686
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,680
if you're putting it out in the cannabis

1687
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:08,160
space i want to know about it

1688
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:09,838
and i can tell you firsthand the

1689
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:12,078
medicinal

1690
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:14,719
side of cannabis has been completely

1691
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:18,400
convoluted by the recreational side

1692
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:18,879
it has set us back uh decades to be

1693
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,079
honest

1694
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:25,039
um the there's so much

1695
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,519
inequality there's so much back and

1696
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:28,159
forth

1697
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:30,159
bullshit with the the research and the

1698
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:32,239
denying of the research

1699
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:34,078
that goes on in cannabis when we know

1700
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:36,399
this plant works and we know it's

1701
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,119
we know it needs to be made accessible

1702
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,400
so

1703
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:43,039
you guys being the pioneers of this and

1704
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,400
empowering people to grow on their own

1705
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:47,519
is imperative

1706
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,039
um because the need is so great i i

1707
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:50,798
can't turn away high thc

1708
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:52,558
products if i'm getting them i can't i

1709
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:53,759
can't be like this won't help my people

1710
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,400
i i can't

1711
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,520
i'm just not at that point because

1712
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,280
cannabis

1713
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:03,440
is the great unifier and it is also

1714
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,960
in many ways for what i do for veterans

1715
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:08,000
walk and talk

1716
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:10,318
it is the healing basic basis of what we

1717
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,039
do but it's also

1718
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:15,279
in a lot of ways it's bait and it's a

1719
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:17,440
way to get veterans

1720
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,559
to learn that this is something that

1721
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,200
they can

1722
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,720
try but also get them to the group and

1723
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:24,879
the community because

1724
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:26,078
as i've said many times cannabis is

1725
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,519
community

1726
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,720
and whether you're consuming it properly

1727
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:33,039
or not

1728
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:35,039
you're getting medicinal value from it

1729
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:37,519
all cannabis use is medicinal all

1730
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:40,798
cannabis uses medicinal all cannabis use

1731
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:42,400
is medicinal so like it's like saying

1732
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:44,480
basketball isn't medicinal

1733
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,000
yes it's a recreational sport you have

1734
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,318
fun when you play it it doesn't mean

1735
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,440
it's not a good thing for your body

1736
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:53,440
so what i tell veterans

1737
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,519
and that you guys thank you for all your

1738
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:59,039
praise about veterans walk and talk

1739
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:01,039
i have seen firsthand all three of you

1740
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:02,239
uh cam you hiked with us in malibu i

1741
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:04,000
think it was or

1742
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,159
you came and sponsored an event in

1743
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,599
malibu we did and docu-hike bridge to

1744
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:09,440
nowhere and joanne and i have been

1745
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:13,519
working hand-in-hand together for

1746
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:17,200
many months now and have big plans um

1747
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:20,639
i have never seen anything anything

1748
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:23,279
like it it's it brings people to a place

1749
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:25,838
of comfort with them within themselves

1750
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,319
it brings people to a place where they

1751
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:30,000
can

1752
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:32,719
face like doc did and say things

1753
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,559
that whether or not we are sitting

1754
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:36,239
around in a table physically smoking

1755
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,160
together cannabis is what brought us

1756
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,159
all to this place right now and

1757
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:41,199
empowered doc to share that for the very

1758
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:42,879
first time

1759
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:44,960
and those are the types of that's it

1760
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:48,000
that's as powerful as it gets

1761
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,500
with cannabis my role

1762
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,559
in cannabis is compassion um

1763
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:55,199
[Music]

1764
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:57,519
i want to advocate for the plant the way

1765
01:00:55,199 --> 01:01:01,039
the plant advocates for me

1766
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:04,239
and which is why i'm so honored to be

1767
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:06,480
on a on a panel with you guys who

1768
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:08,318
are because i know cam and doc

1769
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,280
specifically and you guys can touch on

1770
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:12,558
this later

1771
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,839
but um getting an heirloom a province

1772
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,640
the origin

1773
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:17,440
established in humboldt is something

1774
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,279
that i'm very

1775
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,679
passionate about and i know you guys are

1776
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:25,200
i've talked about this with me before

1777
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:26,078
and um with veterans walk and talk in

1778
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,598
particular

1779
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:31,839
um it's gotten to the point

1780
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,960
where if you're a veteran and you're not

1781
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:34,798
taking

1782
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,720
control of your own health then you're

1783
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:40,400
going to fall under the va

1784
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:43,439
and the va for me i am a 100

1785
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:45,838
disabled combat veteran i

1786
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,679
broke my moral code for this country i i

1787
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:50,798
hurt people for this country

1788
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:53,919
i um watched my brothers get hurt

1789
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:57,838
for this country and uh

1790
01:01:53,920 --> 01:02:01,519
the fact that we have to come back and

1791
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:05,679
take our own health into our hands is

1792
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:07,759
terrifying for many and hard um

1793
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:09,838
i'm having a baby with my beautiful

1794
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,640
girlfriend uh cookie who's a navy

1795
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:13,358
veteran

1796
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:15,279
and worked with nato and served as

1797
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:17,920
proudly as anybody

1798
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,400
we are both covered by the va we are

1799
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,200
both

1800
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,798
unwilling to have our baby there so we

1801
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:24,318
pay for private insurance

1802
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:27,920
even though it would be completely

1803
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:29,358
covered under the va system

1804
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,280
if that doesn't tell you everything you

1805
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:34,558
know about the va i don't know what does

1806
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,640
because literally i mean

1807
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,400
we're spending yes am i spending

1808
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:39,838
disability money that's coming from the

1809
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,720
va to get service

1810
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:45,038
outside of the va yeah i am i'm using

1811
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:48,239
their money so i can get better care

1812
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:51,280
that they don't offer that is so wrong

1813
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:54,479
it is wrong on every level the va's

1814
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,400
motto is defining excellence they have

1815
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:01,039
done nothing of the sort

1816
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,880
um i lived at the va for 11 months

1817
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:04,160
on the campus grounds when i got back

1818
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,280
from afghanistan

1819
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:10,239
i i tried i

1820
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,839
tried to do it their way i i gave it as

1821
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:14,879
honest and effort

1822
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:17,358
as anybody that i have ever met no one

1823
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,440
i in fact i barely rarely meet people

1824
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:19,838
that lived at the va for more than six

1825
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,200
months

1826
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,960
11 months is like unheard of my 11 month

1827
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,199
tenure at the va ended with me in a

1828
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,838
padded cell

1829
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:30,639
at 11 months after all the healing i did

1830
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:32,400
all the effort

1831
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:35,279
one argument with my roommate and i'm in

1832
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:38,000
a padded cell being shot without a van

1833
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,680
all of that out the window gone out on

1834
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,280
the street my stuff

1835
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:43,279
waiting for me when i got back to the

1836
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,920
dormitory on the street

1837
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,440
i was escorted by va police officers

1838
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,000
this was after being on a board of

1839
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,240
directors for the va domiciliary in

1840
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,920
west la va i mean i gave it an honest

1841
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:57,118
effort i took methadone

1842
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,639
i took um i took welbutrin

1843
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,240
i took everything that they would throw

1844
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:01,358
at me just so i could be in my father's

1845
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:04,318
life and be

1846
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:05,440
a good veteran and none of it worked

1847
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:08,719
cannabis

1848
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:12,079
cannabis coming to it like i did

1849
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:13,838
is what saved my life so veterans walk

1850
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:16,000
and talks mission is simple

1851
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:17,440
we walk we talk we talk about whatever

1852
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,440
comes to our minds

1853
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,639
cannabis usually being at the forefront

1854
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,480
of that now

1855
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:27,920
um mushrooms have been a amazing healing

1856
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:30,880
component for for veterans we we use it

1857
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,798
almost on every hike now there are

1858
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,240
several veterans that are partaking in

1859
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:36,239
in a in a

1860
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:39,199
you know in some form of mushroom

1861
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:40,879
therapy or at least learning about it

1862
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:42,480
veterans walk and talk has grown to be

1863
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,880
much more than just

1864
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,798
a group of hiking individuals as you all

1865
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:50,798
know like we advocate

1866
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:53,440
we grow we are we are just

1867
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:54,079
social justice warriors we are at the

1868
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,400
forefront

1869
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,079
of knocking down the fascist regime

1870
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,039
that's taking over our country

1871
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:01,599
we are just doing all the good work so

1872
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,280
um

1873
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,280
i hope i didn't rant too much but that's

1874
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,798
that's my piece for this and i'm just

1875
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,039
very grateful you guys are touching on

1876
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:10,960
everything you're saying so thank you

1877
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,720
now i i think that's critically

1878
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,039
important like i i

1879
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:16,078
want each of you to kind of give

1880
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,799
concrete

1881
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,519
and you just did it kind of here's my

1882
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:23,199
personal

1883
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:26,079
journey and like you know i i think

1884
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,279
one thing you just mentioned was kind of

1885
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:31,119
you know

1886
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:33,280
you you come back to the us

1887
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,160
and you're kind of pushed into the va

1888
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,039
system and

1889
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:38,719
and the current state of the va system

1890
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,440
i'd like you guys to touch a little more

1891
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:44,000
on that

1892
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:47,519
and and is it changing

1893
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,760
is this stuck in some time warp that

1894
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:50,639
you just don't have any hope medium term

1895
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,640
for

1896
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:54,318
and then for each of you it's kind of

1897
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:57,920
like you you took

1898
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:58,480
control of your own destiny and one

1899
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,358
thing

1900
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,000
colin you just mentioned was like you

1901
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:04,798
know

1902
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,838
someone goes into a dispensary and buys

1903
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:10,318
the

1904
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:12,239
you know designer cultivar du jour

1905
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:13,679
and they smoke it and they have a

1906
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:15,519
paranoid freak out

1907
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,598
and maybe they never want to touch it

1908
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:21,119
again and you're like oh my god that was

1909
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:24,160
that was an opportunity lost because

1910
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:28,079
had that person tried something that

1911
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:30,159
is right for them they'd start healing

1912
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,000
and and they'd find something that

1913
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:35,920
helped and instead they

1914
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,400
had this you know you know anxiety

1915
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,960
uh written experience which you seem to

1916
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,680
have so

1917
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,119
so can each of you kind of and colin you

1918
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:44,480
you just did a little bit but if you

1919
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:48,160
want to expand on it or

1920
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:50,318
joanne you want to talk kind of like

1921
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:52,159
what you started with what you noticed

1922
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:54,558
what you realized worked with you

1923
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:56,318
and then that's your personal experience

1924
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,039
and then each of you has experience with

1925
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:00,159
at least 10

1926
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,960
20 30 50 friends who are veterans and

1927
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:04,798
kind of just

1928
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:08,079
be specific talk about my friend billy

1929
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:09,119
like he this was his journey and this is

1930
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:12,798
what we learned

1931
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,798
on his behalf along the way

1932
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,839
yeah i mean because these anecdotal

1933
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,000
stories i mean

1934
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:21,759
these are real stories of real people

1935
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,280
and what works what doesn't work and

1936
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,480
it's important for people to

1937
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,798
to or basically for us to document wins

1938
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:31,119
and losses right

1939
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:32,798
i will start if that's okay because i

1940
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:35,119
i've been doing veterans walk and talk

1941
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:37,920
since late 2016 for four years

1942
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:39,838
um for the first few years i was still

1943
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,960
struggling with a lot of issues

1944
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:44,798
and finding my way in many ways and then

1945
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,880
veterans walk and talk and myself we

1946
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:50,000
really made a name for ourselves

1947
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,440
by driving to the va and saying i don't

1948
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,440
give a fuck what you think about

1949
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,960
cannabis i'm picking your people up and

1950
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,559
taking them hiking and i'm gonna get

1951
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,240
them high and if you kick them out i

1952
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:01,599
will be at the door waiting for them

1953
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:03,838
to give them a house and and this was at

1954
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:06,400
the west la va

1955
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:08,078
west la vie uh the chatsworth va i've

1956
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:11,039
picked up veterans and also at

1957
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:12,160
several um out the va outsources like

1958
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:15,520
crazy so

1959
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:16,318
um several uh you know you call them

1960
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:18,960
shelters

1961
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:20,960
um in downtown l.a that i would pick up

1962
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,600
homeless veterans and take them hiking

1963
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,880

1964
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,960
and they i can tell you i with with a

1965
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,920
few exceptions i've lost

1966
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,560
i've lost to suicide some of them i've

1967
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,279
lost

1968
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,000
to um to further homelessness and drug

1969
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:37,359
addiction

1970
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,679
which any anybody in this profession

1971
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:41,199
it's just you you can't there's 22

1972
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,158
veterans a day dying you're going to

1973
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:44,158
lose some

1974
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,599
and and that's why we put ourselves out

1975
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:48,559
there but

1976
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,319
the ones that that continued to hike and

1977
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,279
continue to garner

1978
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,560
what cannabis had to offer i am still in

1979
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:57,440
touch with them they're

1980
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,000
usually back at home with their families

1981
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:01,278
they are

1982
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,520
working in the cannabis space now lifted

1983
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,480
up by it in many ways whether it be

1984
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,799
security or

1985
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:08,639
cultivating the plant growing it on

1986
01:09:06,798 --> 01:09:10,238
farms where they can seclude themselves

1987
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,199
but they don't actually have to buy the

1988
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:13,358
land as

1989
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:15,119
as doc ray was afforded to do and did

1990
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,400
many many years ago and it's what i want

1991
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:20,238
to do as well

1992
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:24,000
so um the the healing

1993
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:25,039
like i i have 200 members of veterans

1994
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,560
walk and talk

1995
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:28,319
if i were to put out an email

1996
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,319
questionnaire to them saying

1997
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,440
what healed you better the va or

1998
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:33,279
cannabis the

1999
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:34,798
the results i don't even need to do it i

2000
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,920
know what the results are

2001
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:41,278
the the va has dropped the ball um

2002
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:43,679
now it's seems a little bit

2003
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,640
like it's getting better you can talk

2004
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,440
about cannabis

2005
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,000
and maybe i'd love to hear joanne talk

2006
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:50,318
about what

2007
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,838
she what she discusses with with your

2008
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,400
medical professional because

2009
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:56,559
i keep it very i use plant medicine

2010
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:58,079
plant medicine plant medicine

2011
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,640
that's what i discuss but i have a

2012
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:02,238
permanent disability so i don't have to

2013
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,679
i don't have to i could say whatever i

2014
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:04,879
want to them basically as long as i'm

2015
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,079
not hurting people with the money

2016
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,359
they're giving me

2017
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:11,359
um but for for others you know it's

2018
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:13,679
terrifying to bring up cannabis use it's

2019
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:16,719
terrifying to talk about mushroom use

2020
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:17,279
i uh we're having a baby cannabis you

2021
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:20,399
know

2022
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:21,279
it's nausea come on i mean morning

2023
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:23,679
sickness

2024
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:24,559
it it's night and day you you take some

2025
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:26,239
cannabis

2026
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,159
you don't throw up you don't take

2027
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:30,158
cannabis you throw up

2028
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:31,759
i just i don't need more evidence than

2029
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:34,399
that and um that's

2030
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,679
so the va dropping the ball and an

2031
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:38,399
excellent book is the

2032
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:38,719
the ex-va secretary david shulkin's book

2033
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:40,079
um

2034
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:42,000
it shouldn't be this hard to serve your

2035
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:45,119
country he lays it out

2036
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,198
as well as anybody um just

2037
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:48,880
explaining how he tried to fix it from

2038
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:51,519
the internal and how it's just

2039
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:53,039
it america we got to just admit that

2040
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,320
some things didn't work and we have to

2041
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:56,319
revamp them from

2042
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:58,158
from the ground up basically and i'd

2043
01:10:56,319 --> 01:11:00,880
love to hear from joanne moore

2044
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:01,599
well just before joanne starts can you

2045
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,640
talk about

2046
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,320
i mean you're showing up unannounced at

2047
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,960
a va facility

2048
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:11,359
and pulling people to go hang out and

2049
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:13,920
smoke weed like

2050
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:14,719
were there bureaucratic administrators

2051
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,199
at the va

2052
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:17,760
who were supportive others who thought

2053
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:20,319
you were

2054
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,199
doing the devil's work like did they

2055
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:24,319
bring the

2056
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:24,960
mps in to escort you off the facility

2057
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:26,719
like

2058
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,480
what were some of the the the

2059
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:31,520
interactions with the va

2060
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:32,559
staff yeah thank you very much for

2061
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,840
asking that question

2062
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:39,679
i really appreciate that um yeah

2063
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:41,920
i ran into the craziest

2064
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:44,000
of of scenarios picking the veterans up

2065
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,640
at the va which is a large reason why i

2066
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,760
can't do it anymore and what was

2067
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:51,119
happening was

2068
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:55,679
um my members were being

2069
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:58,960
searched at a higher rate in their rooms

2070
01:11:55,679 --> 01:12:01,279
the v watt members were being

2071
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,800
harassed they were being denied certain

2072
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:05,439
things

2073
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,840
they were being given unfair curfews

2074
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:07,519
that

2075
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,199
you know you have to understand the

2076
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:12,239
places that i i

2077
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:15,919
was picking veterans up they

2078
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:18,639
have to qualify for for instance when i

2079
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,359
lived at the domiciliary in the west la

2080
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,360
va

2081
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:23,359
i lived on both the substance abuse

2082
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:24,479
track and the combat trauma treatment

2083
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:27,119
track

2084
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:27,519
i was a homeless drug addicted veteran

2085
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:30,479
but

2086
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:32,719
you have to interview for a spot you

2087
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,238
have to qualify you have to show that

2088
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:36,399
you're

2089
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:37,519
have the initiative to heal or whatever

2090
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:41,039
the hell that means

2091
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:43,360
and they turn people away and so

2092
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:45,519
if you admit to cannabis use you will

2093
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:49,599
just simply not get a bed

2094
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:52,960
and so yeah they were being searched and

2095
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:55,120
fucked with and my i

2096
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,119
i had to take into consideration that i

2097
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:59,039
am not a medical professional i'm not a

2098
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:01,039
doctor i'm not a licensed counselor i

2099
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:02,560
don't have the protections that the va

2100
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:05,600
has in place

2101
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:08,000
so what i was running into was my most

2102
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,719
severe cases my most severe brothers and

2103
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,840
sisters

2104
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:13,760
who i was picking up at the va

2105
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,360
i had to listen to what they were saying

2106
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,280
but i also had to take into

2107
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:20,479
consideration that they were there

2108
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:22,000
for sometimes paranoid schizophrenia for

2109
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:24,559
sometimes

2110
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,319
delusional thoughts these are and again

2111
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,960
i had delusional thoughts

2112
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:29,359
i still have delusional thoughts but i

2113
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,679
um

2114
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:32,960
i'm not i shouldn't be hospitalized over

2115
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:35,359
them you know what i mean

2116
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,719
so when these veterans were telling me

2117
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:38,479
that their

2118
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,079
heat was being turned off in their room

2119
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:41,279
which they were paying for out of their

2120
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:44,079
own disability

2121
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:45,119
or that the water and i have video the

2122
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:47,840
water is brown

2123
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:49,519
running out of their bathtub constantly

2124
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,440
and they're the only room on the floor

2125
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,520
that has this issue

2126
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:55,599
you have to wonder is it related is it

2127
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,679
related to the fact that these veterans

2128
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,280
aren't falling into line with what the

2129
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:01,840
va is prescribing them

2130
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:02,399
and again i these are veterans who

2131
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,719
didn't

2132
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:06,319
live in a treatment program like i did i

2133
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:07,840
would never have been able to walk with

2134
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:09,439
veterans walk and talk living in the

2135
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,199
treatment program i lived in

2136
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:12,719
not a chance i would have been kicked

2137
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:14,399
out immediately

2138
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,399
the veterans i was picking up were

2139
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:18,799
paying to rent a place

2140
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:19,599
on the va grounds that was leased to

2141
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,800
them

2142
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,880
so the va would lease the the building

2143
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,119
on the va grounds to a company like

2144
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:29,359
salvation army or the disabled american

2145
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:29,840
veterans association or iava or any of

2146
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:32,319
these

2147
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,480
and then they would in turn rent it back

2148
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,880
to the va and then

2149
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:38,559
and so you don't even know you're in one

2150
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,000
building one second you're in a private

2151
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,600
institution you're in another building

2152
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,039
the next second you're falling under va

2153
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:46,800
rule

2154
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:50,399
so there's really just no clear cut

2155
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:52,560
like for me why is it that veterans

2156
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:54,399
aren't given this alternative

2157
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,960
six months into before leaving the

2158
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:57,359
military why is veterans walk and talk

2159
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,960
not

2160
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:00,639
hey you're leaving you're leaving the

2161
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,439
military in six months

2162
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:05,199
in order to qualify for the medical

2163
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:06,238
marijuana the cannabis that we want to

2164
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:09,359
give you

2165
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:11,439
you have to go or we suggest you go

2166
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:12,880
walk with veterans walk and talk oh

2167
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:13,919
you're in you're in a wheelchair you're

2168
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,719
a paralyzed

2169
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,359
veteran so we will suggest that you

2170
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,640
instead

2171
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:22,319
go do veterans art and talk go paint

2172
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,400
if you do this you will be given

2173
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:26,960
cannabis while you do it then

2174
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:27,839
slowly you will be released as as you go

2175
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,520
but

2176
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:34,319
just giving veterans cannabis veterans

2177
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:36,960
more medicine that's not going to work

2178
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:39,519
alternative therapies

2179
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,399
a new lease on life is what cannabis

2180
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,199
gives you

2181
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:43,599
and we need to shepherd that in every

2182
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:46,799
way

2183
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:49,520
and there's no reason why

2184
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,960
alcoholism drug addiction depression

2185
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,960
ptsd

2186
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:55,039
there's no reason why all these things

2187
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,158
we have to knock out before we come to

2188
01:15:55,039 --> 01:15:58,399
cannabis

2189
01:15:56,158 --> 01:16:00,319
cannabis should be the first thing and

2190
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:02,799
then we tackle these things

2191
01:16:00,319 --> 01:16:03,679
so that's that's what veterans walk and

2192
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,000
talk stigma

2193
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:08,158
is trying to break the stigma of i'm

2194
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,479
denied i can't see my son

2195
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:12,000
that lives in north carolina i have two

2196
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:13,439
step step sons

2197
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,679
and a daughter on the way and a son in

2198
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:16,799
north carolina my son in north carolina

2199
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:19,119
i have not seen and

2200
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,079
it'll be a year in november because of

2201
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:21,679
my choices because

2202
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:24,000
i won't take prescriptions because i

2203
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:25,199
won't stop talking about cannabis and

2204
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,198
mushrooms

2205
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:29,279
i i don't get to see him i barely get to

2206
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:31,599
skype with him if i bring up mushrooms

2207
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:32,840
or cannabis on a skype it's cut

2208
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,320
immediately

2209
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:38,079
so these are sacrifices that we have to

2210
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:39,920
make because we know

2211
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:41,359
we know the truth of it and once you

2212
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,880
know the truth of cannabis you can't

2213
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:44,880
help but sing it from the mountaintops

2214
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:49,439
so just quickly the neighbor is either

2215
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,279
cutting a tree down or

2216
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:54,079
doing something but this is what you

2217
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:57,599
were talking about from david shulkin

2218
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,800
let me just uh yeah that's a brilliant

2219
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,079
thing

2220
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,920
and then uh joanne you want to jump in

2221
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:08,319
and kind of tell your i think

2222
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:12,158
it's basically your story of you know

2223
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:14,319
figuring out that this works for you

2224
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:16,158
and then specifically what works what

2225
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:19,679
doesn't work cause some cannabis

2226
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:22,079
and form factors of taking it maybe

2227
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:22,719
don't work or are less effective or

2228
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:26,640
adverse

2229
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:27,760
in the same way colin was talking about

2230
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,320
where it's like i had

2231
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,960
anxiety so can you kind of talk about

2232
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:33,198
your

2233
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,119
journey of discovery and then any

2234
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:35,599
friends who you have where you can talk

2235
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,960
about

2236
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:42,640
kind of their experience as well

2237
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:45,920
yeah i'll absolutely uh share

2238
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,880
my experience um i was in the aviation

2239
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:51,119
community

2240
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:54,159
um here with the navy stationed in

2241
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:57,760
lamar california working with uh

2242
01:17:54,158 --> 01:18:00,000
f-18 aircraft um during my first

2243
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,600
deployment

2244
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,920
working on the flight deck i was

2245
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:09,280
actually blown by jet aircraft

2246
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:14,158
um jet blast from the aircraft

2247
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:17,279
and long story short

2248
01:18:14,158 --> 01:18:22,000
it was a horrible accident i

2249
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:25,439
had a concussion from it and

2250
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:28,800
couldn't speak english for you know

2251
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:33,119
about 20 minutes um

2252
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:35,520
and uh long story short

2253
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:36,960
that created a whole bunch of problems

2254
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,920
you know from

2255
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,439
the main one that i could experience and

2256
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:44,560
could put my finger on

2257
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:45,198
um throughout that time was the size the

2258
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,640
headaches

2259
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:52,000
and and the back pain it was

2260
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:55,199
i couldn't sleep um for more than like

2261
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,279
two consecutive hours or um

2262
01:18:55,198 --> 01:18:59,519
every night so i was waking up every

2263
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:03,439
hour every two hours

2264
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:06,239
um and that happened needless to say

2265
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:07,039
i still had time to serve i did nine

2266
01:19:06,238 --> 01:19:09,469
months of

2267
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:10,640
physical therapy

2268
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:14,079
[Music]

2269
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:17,440
and went back on deployment uh

2270
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:19,679
and then that deployment was where i

2271
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:21,759
realized that i my sleeping became a

2272
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:24,960
problem

2273
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:28,079
because we were working 12 hours and i

2274
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,679
still was up like 20 hours because i

2275
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:33,039
wasn't sleeping

2276
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:35,679
um and that problem

2277
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:36,399
i literally was lit out of the military

2278
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:39,199
because

2279
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:40,319
after that i wasn't the same person

2280
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:43,279
anymore so

2281
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:44,319
i didn't even want to be there but um

2282
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:48,079
coming out

2283
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:51,519
you know that's when all the issues

2284
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:53,519
uh became more exacerbated because now

2285
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:57,840
i'm alone in my thoughts and

2286
01:19:53,520 --> 01:20:00,239
um so i fell into the hands of the va

2287
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,960
i was not you know unlike some of you

2288
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:03,519
guys i

2289
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,000
had not experimented with cannabis even

2290
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,639
before

2291
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,679
that very you know in college i did do

2292
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:10,639
it every

2293
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:12,079
a few times but it wasn't like a thing i

2294
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:14,880
had never heard

2295
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:16,319
of medicinal cannabis or using it you

2296
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:19,119
know i thought that

2297
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:19,519
i had heard of maybe glaucoma that you

2298
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:21,359
can

2299
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,000
use it for and i thought you know it was

2300
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:26,719
maybe a joke i wasn't even

2301
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,279
that's how disconnected i was um at that

2302
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,920
point

2303
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:32,319
in my life with it and then i i met a

2304
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:36,480
person who was a grower um

2305
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:38,960
and he was working towards

2306
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:40,158
at that point it was 2014 he was working

2307
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:44,000
on

2308
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:46,158
um a legal cannabis

2309
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
grow you know and i'm like what does

2310
01:20:46,158 --> 01:20:50,479
that even mean

2311
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,158
um but even before we got to that point

2312
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:55,919
he introduced me to cannabis

2313
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:59,039
um uh it was actually rso

2314
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,440
he gave me a little syringe looking

2315
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:02,479
thing

2316
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:02,799
and told me take a grain of rice and i

2317
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:06,000
did

2318
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:07,199
it and i'm telling you right now that

2319
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:12,000
changed

2320
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:14,638
everything i am talking about

2321
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,198
for three years i could not tell you who

2322
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:18,960
i was

2323
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:22,638
i could not i had no clue um

2324
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:24,880
and starting that regimen in or that

2325
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:26,840
becoming a routine you know before i

2326
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:30,319
went to sleep

2327
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:33,119
um pretty much i

2328
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:35,359
cannabis was able to help me sleep and

2329
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:36,079
that solves so many other problems you

2330
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:39,039
know

2331
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:40,880
um the pain with the the backaches

2332
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:42,238
trying to sleep and and all that

2333
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:45,600
situation

2334
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:47,919
literally within a month i was already

2335
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,880
the person that i remember being you

2336
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:54,079
know before all these problems began

2337
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:55,760
and i just made it my mission to make

2338
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:59,198
sure i spread this message

2339
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:02,239
however i could i quit my job and became

2340
01:21:59,198 --> 01:22:04,158
completely involved not only in trying

2341
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:07,039
to figure out what worked for me

2342
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:08,238
because i did um i know doc brought it

2343
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:11,039
up earlier

2344
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:12,799
uh there were you know some of the

2345
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:13,840
things then i started experimenting with

2346
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,880
the smoking

2347
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:20,319
um i quit cigarettes um

2348
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:24,079
and focused on cannabis and

2349
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:27,279
never had to pick that back up again

2350
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:30,719
and doing it with the edibles with the

2351
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:33,039
just trying to find out where i was

2352
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:34,079
um i'm a flower person i love flower and

2353
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:36,158
that's what

2354
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:37,279
helps me the most to not only be

2355
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:40,638
functional

2356
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:43,119
but also you know to manage

2357
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:45,440
pain to manage the anxiety that arose

2358
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:49,439
from not sleeping for years

2359
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:52,079
um and just even my eating habits

2360
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:52,879
it i mean it was it was just a situation

2361
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:56,000
so i i

2362
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,639
became so serious about it that i have a

2363
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,279
journal

2364
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:01,520
where i keep the names of the strains if

2365
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:02,639
i'm you know if i'm able to identify

2366
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:06,080
that strain

2367
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:06,960
and how i felt document it you know more

2368
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:10,399
of that

2369
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:13,359
for creativity more of that for no pain

2370
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:14,479
more of that to be able to sleep through

2371
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:17,519
the night

2372
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:18,718
um and then documenting to the ones who

2373
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:22,639
fell paranoid

2374
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:23,920
or fell you know draghi or whatever the

2375
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:27,760
case may be

2376
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:31,119
um and from there it's been

2377
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:34,639
it's been like i said a game changer i

2378
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:37,198
know individuals in my circle who

2379
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:37,840
have i have a friend dave he actually

2380
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,399
makes

2381
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,520
a bomb at home from the plants that he

2382
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:45,119
grows

2383
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:48,560
and i know people in my family

2384
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:50,319
um my aunt in the dominican republic

2385
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,800
she's using the bomb right now she's

2386
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:53,840
diabetic she suffers from diabetes she's

2387
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,920
had it for

2388
01:23:53,840 --> 01:24:01,679
ever she had she has a wound in her foot

2389
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:03,199
that she got that it's gnarly but she's

2390
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:06,000
had it for 10 years because of the

2391
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:09,759
diabetes she's not able to heal

2392
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:12,719
um and with dave's bomb

2393
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,560
she already has unless i am telling you

2394
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:17,198
in less than six months

2395
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,679
she's experienced she already has a scab

2396
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:20,879
on it

2397
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:24,560
which means that her skin is completely

2398
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:26,800
being regenerated inc with the diabetes

2399
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:29,920
the diabetes status is there

2400
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:33,279
the cannabis bomb has been able

2401
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,840
to i mean i can show you the before and

2402
01:24:33,279 --> 01:24:36,880
after

2403
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:38,639
her her whole foot was

2404
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,319
in the verge of being completely

2405
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:42,719
engulfed in this

2406
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:44,399
uh wound because since it didn't heal it

2407
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:45,520
continued to get infections and things

2408
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:48,719
like that

2409
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:51,360
um with the cannabis

2410
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,399
she sent me and whatsapp this message

2411
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:56,000
this long

2412
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:59,119
thanking me so much i mean

2413
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,439
my on is like in her 80s so

2414
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:03,039
you know the fact that this thing was

2415
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:06,479
hindering her life

2416
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:09,840
for a decade and with cannabis

2417
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:13,198
what what medication was not able to do

2418
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:16,319
in years a decade

2419
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:18,559
in six months she's already has like a

2420
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:20,719
normal healing process with her

2421
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,840
and you know she's not smoking it she's

2422
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:24,719
not getting

2423
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,199
doing bone rips or anything like that

2424
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:28,239
she

2425
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:31,279
is literally using it as a topical

2426
01:25:28,238 --> 01:25:33,198
um and that that's like one of the most

2427
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:36,238
compelling stories i have besides

2428
01:25:33,198 --> 01:25:37,759
the fact that i cannabis prevented me

2429
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:41,119
from committing suicide i

2430
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,920
was literally on the floor with a gun in

2431
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:44,800
my hand

2432
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,279
contemplating that um when i met that

2433
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,800
guy

2434
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:51,599
um that same week and he

2435
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,279
introduced me to cannabis and here we

2436
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:56,000
are five years later

2437
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:58,079
um and i wouldn't change it any other

2438
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,719
way it was perfect timing for me

2439
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:02,238
um it became a complete journey from

2440
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:04,399
there and here i am

2441
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:06,638
um five years later um having this

2442
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:10,000
conversation which i think is

2443
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:12,639
crucial for people to um

2444
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,119
listen to and and other people because

2445
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:17,199
you know you guys are just

2446
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:19,198
some people like in your area in the

2447
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:22,000
humble county area

2448
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:23,839
lord knows how many growers have so much

2449
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,359
information

2450
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:29,840
it's crazy it's crazy

2451
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:32,719
we have to give people like we have to

2452
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:35,279
give these people a platform so they can

2453
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,639
get this information out there and i

2454
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:38,399
made that you know

2455
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,239
my mission to be able to contribute to

2456
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:42,238
that in that sense

2457
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:44,399
um so i'm very passionate about it very

2458
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:46,238
thankful to the plan to people

2459
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:48,559
that grow it like you guys through

2460
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:52,000
people like colin who

2461
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:55,920
you know create communities and and then

2462
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:58,479
infuse the message of wellness and just

2463
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,560
being able to be stable and the fact

2464
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:02,319
that it's okay to feel some kind of way

2465
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:05,199
but here you know these are

2466
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:06,158
alternatives because i cannot take pills

2467
01:27:05,198 --> 01:27:08,158
you know i

2468
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:09,519
because of the headaches that i get from

2469
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:12,719
the concussion

2470
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:14,080
um they give me 800 milligrams of

2471
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:16,880
ibuprofen

2472
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:17,439
um pills that i got to take these spills

2473
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,639
are like

2474
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:23,919
this big i can't even it's

2475
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:27,920
i can't do it um you know

2476
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:30,800
so i one i sometimes

2477
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:32,239
had to like get creative trying to mix

2478
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:35,920
it with something else

2479
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:38,319
but still like with cannabis

2480
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,840
it's it's natural it doesn't hurt my

2481
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:43,039
liver you know because

2482
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:46,159
with big with big pharma

2483
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:49,039
medicine it usually creates

2484
01:27:46,158 --> 01:27:49,920
an underlying issue if you can if you

2485
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:53,840
use it for

2486
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:56,158
long periods of time so um

2487
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,079
i prefer the alternative that something

2488
01:27:56,158 --> 01:28:00,000
that's not gonna harm me so i don't have

2489
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:03,279
to worry about side effects

2490
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,198
or long-term effects um and then being

2491
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:07,599
detrimental to myself

2492
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:09,039
which will eventually create another

2493
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,880
problem

2494
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:12,238
so like i said i'm super thankful to be

2495
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:15,279
here i know

2496
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:16,079
the power of the plant um is not even

2497
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:19,279
just for

2498
01:28:16,079 --> 01:28:19,760
medic medical purposes it's for pretty

2499
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:22,960
much

2500
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:25,760
anything but creating glass or steel

2501
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:27,679
other than that we can't use this

2502
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:31,119
eco-friendly product

2503
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:33,840
or crop to you know to help the world so

2504
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:36,719
thank you for having me here i think

2505
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:39,199
it's really critical right now too that

2506
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:40,639
the conversation that we all for having

2507
01:28:39,198 --> 01:28:43,439
is this

2508
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:45,199
we know this information and and i think

2509
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:47,839
joanne specifically is

2510
01:28:45,198 --> 01:28:49,678
how do we take what we've all know to be

2511
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,440
the truth is how do we get it beyond

2512
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:54,000
this point you know how do we get it to

2513
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:55,599
reach the masses where how do we

2514
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,399
saturate more where

2515
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,600
and i and i don't know is it you know we

2516
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:01,920
maybe it is

2517
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,600
pavlov's dog you know repeat it over and

2518
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,800
over and over again and eventually it

2519
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:08,400
sticks you know

2520
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:10,000
i i've been preaching it for 40 years

2521
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:11,599
i'm not sure that it's

2522
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,079
maybe it's sticking now is it just

2523
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:16,120
generationally moved so much

2524
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:18,479
where so many people with a this

2525
01:29:16,119 --> 01:29:20,559
quasi-legal thing that we're in that

2526
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,399
are stepping forward because the state

2527
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,840
says are okay

2528
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:26,399
you know if we can get this federal

2529
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:28,000
shift to come hopefully in the next 24

2530
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:30,399
months get this federal ship to come

2531
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,560
with the d-class on schedule one

2532
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:34,399
where as it rightfully should be that

2533
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,080
that does have true medical value as a

2534
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:39,198
matter of fact it's at the top of the

2535
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:40,800
pharmacopoeia of medical value that's

2536
01:29:39,198 --> 01:29:42,879
where we need to move this to where we

2537
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,480
can get it to open where

2538
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,920
the ones that are still standing on the

2539
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:48,879
sidelines watching that

2540
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,279
and you alluded to it earlier of fear

2541
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,520
you know

2542
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:52,559
a fear of repercussion of the unknown

2543
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,120
it's here too

2544
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,320
yeah i'm kind of on the tip of the spear

2545
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:58,639
here for

2546
01:29:56,319 --> 01:30:00,639
cannabis because i have outed myself and

2547
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,319
put my face on videos and so then a lot

2548
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:04,880
of my grower friends

2549
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:06,000
as you said sisters the truth is about

2550
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,000
80 percent of the

2551
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,319
best genetics in the world are within

2552
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:15,359
about a 50-mile radius of where i live

2553
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:15,920
and and i know the bulk of them you know

2554
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:17,439
it's like

2555
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,119
there are a lot of them with what dylan

2556
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:21,119
are doing two years ago they wouldn't

2557
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:22,079
even come to a meeting that when he met

2558
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:25,198
me up here in the

2559
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:27,279
redwoods they wouldn't come to it and

2560
01:30:25,198 --> 01:30:29,039
this earlier this year in january on the

2561
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:29,359
radio i had him on the radio with me at

2562
01:30:29,039 --> 01:30:31,519
k

2563
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:33,439
on k mud and the people there that

2564
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,120
wouldn't engage with me last year about

2565
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:36,960
the topic of

2566
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:38,880
patent protections what i'm doing plant

2567
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,760
patent protection so people can't rip me

2568
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:44,000
off anymore

2569
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:46,960
okay that's my primary yes absolutely

2570
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,039
it is and that's mostly so that's just

2571
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,920
one side of it is branding and aligning

2572
01:30:49,039 --> 01:30:53,039
with cam

2573
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:55,119
so that so high tide distro can help get

2574
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:56,079
veterans choice cannabis across the

2575
01:30:55,119 --> 01:30:59,439
country

2576
01:30:56,079 --> 01:30:59,920
you know we're going to blow california

2577
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:01,519
up but

2578
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,359
just when the time is right moving

2579
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:06,719
across the country you know

2580
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:09,920
that's the big goal right now i think is

2581
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:09,920
we all get the same kind of

2582
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:14,079
the same phraseology the same verbiage

2583
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:14,639
we're all saying the same thing you know

2584
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:17,039
and

2585
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:17,760
and i'm hoping maybe this conversation

2586
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:19,679
we can with

2587
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,360
other leaders within our respective

2588
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:21,840
groups we can get where we're all using

2589
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:23,679
like

2590
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,039
you know let's quit saying strain you

2591
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:26,239
know let's pick up the correct

2592
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:29,359
phraseology of

2593
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:32,479
chemovar or cultivar and and

2594
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:33,920
to to make ourselves

2595
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:35,839
and i know this sounds terrible but to

2596
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,158
make ourselves look more professional

2597
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:40,159
you know i mean honestly god i cleaned

2598
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:41,359
up today so i didn't look so shaggy you

2599
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:43,679
know and and

2600
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:44,960
that's kind of i know cam yo we already

2601
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:46,960
look like rough

2602
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:48,639
rowdy rough next to a lot of people

2603
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:52,000
anyway just because we look like

2604
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:53,840
wild old fuzzy guys you know and and we

2605
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,920
and we need people that can help us

2606
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:57,440
translate across where that

2607
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,600
you know we're talking about chemivours

2608
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:02,079
and cultivars and even me personally in

2609
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:04,800
the last 24 months having access to

2610
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:06,719
peter led to that earlier i have access

2611
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,960
to the medical professionals now where i

2612
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:12,880
can get the correct phraseology and i

2613
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:15,840
understand cbd and cbg and cbn

2614
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:17,679
and things that i didn't know how to say

2615
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:19,600
that three years ago you know

2616
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:21,199
i got what it did and i could tell you

2617
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,639
know if you smoke this man i promise you

2618
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:23,519
in about 20 minutes you're gonna be

2619
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:25,679
relaxed

2620
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,120
and like the razzleberry kush you know

2621
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:29,760
and you alluded to it

2622
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:32,079
just briefly on that one that is a true

2623
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:35,520
heirloom one to one cultivar

2624
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:39,039
it is a full spectrum cbd

2625
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:42,159
thc rich and it is literally about

2626
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:43,679
15 thc most

2627
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:46,238
shops won't even want to look at that

2628
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:46,800
but what it also is is it's 15 freaking

2629
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:50,079
percent

2630
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:51,840
cbd man and you smoke that puppy and in

2631

01:34:43,039 --> 01:34:46,158
where

2690
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,760
i can teach this out on math scale so we

2691
01:34:46,158 --> 01:34:49,599
can get it out there

2692
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:51,440
and let people have access to good

2693
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,840
information but also

2694
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:55,678
for me to call and calling cam and are

2695
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:58,880
building that damn retreat

2696
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:00,960
okay yeah building outlets man

2697
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:02,480

2698
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:05,679

2699
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:05,678
fucking mouth is man

2700

and walk it sister you know and walk it

2701
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,719
you know and that's what came in my

2702
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:14,239
literally part of our conversations we

2703
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:17,198
want to build it up because he

2704
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:18,638
he he needs to ramp up his supply he

2705
01:35:17,198 --> 01:35:21,279
can't keep up with demand

2706
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:23,039
i will i can't get mine out you're

2707
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:24,639
hitting it on the head doc it's like we

2708
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:26,479
got to do it ourselves or no one's going

2709
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:29,520
to do it for us veterans walk and talk

2710
01:35:26,479 --> 01:35:31,678
has held three retreats so far and

2711
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:33,199
honestly everyone has been successful

2712
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:36,880
but everyone has been also

2713
01:35:33,198 --> 01:35:38,559
a huge risk because i am taking combat

2714
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,440
veterans out into the desert out into

2715
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:42,800
the woods with

2716
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:43,439
no insurance no medical professionals

2717
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,440
just

2718
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:46,479
the knowledge that i know i can help

2719
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:49,118
them and

2720
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:50,638
and doing it and so it does it takes

2721
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:53,118
people like yourself to just

2722
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:55,279
put plan put it into action because no

2723
01:35:53,118 --> 01:35:56,960
one is going to do it for us period

2724
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:58,319
we have an alignment we didn't have a

2725
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,319
year ago too

2726
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:02,079

love him so much he's like

2731
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:12,639
he's the the pa plant patent guy in the

2732
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:15,279
frickin country for crying out loud and

2733
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:16,960
oh yeah he's a plant lawyer too oops

2734
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:20,319
yeah but he happens to have a navy son

2735

that has pts and he loves my flowers

2736
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:25,519
right well it takes people like you guys

2737
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:28,079
and lawyers honestly and politicians

2738
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,719
to change the nomenclature of cannabis

2739
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:32,158
from

2740
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:34,319
graham dabs to anandamide from

2741
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:36,399
from taking this can put you in

2742
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:37,599
homeostasis why does no one talk about

2743
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:39,519
homeostasis

2744
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:41,600
why does nobody talk about the fact that

2745
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,080
bong loads and dabs can spike you in and

2746
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,480
out

2747
01:36:42,079 --> 01:36:45,840
and yes while you're spiking here's your

2748
01:36:44,479 --> 01:36:47,359
homeostasis level

2749
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,039
you feel good while you're in that level

2750
01:36:47,359 --> 01:36:52,399
but you spike in and out

2751
01:36:49,039 --> 01:36:54,960
whereas if you take it like intuitively

2752
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:56,960
you can actually stay within that level

2753
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,319
and continually produce an endomite and

2754
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,560
stay in homeostasis

2755
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:02,079
this is what we need to be talking about

2756
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:05,039
this is what we've been doing

2757
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:07,359
is uh i know i didn't set out to start a

2758
01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:09,679
distribution company i was making pot

2759
01:37:07,359 --> 01:37:11,679
ice cream in the virgin islands 25 years

2760
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:13,600
ago because it made me feel good

2761
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:15,118
and i just kept carrying on with the

2762
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:17,199
plant and

2763
01:37:15,118 --> 01:37:19,599
we've been my wife and i shannon we've

2764
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:21,198
been growing uh

2765
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:23,440
under the 215 model in northern

2766
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:26,238
california for over 10 years now

2767
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:27,759
and we started growing cbd strains uh

2768
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:28,879
eight years ago we were one of the very

2769
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,880
first farms

2770
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:32,880
in the united states to grow cbd strains

2771
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,319
we got our original seeds from lawrence

2772
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,079
ringo and

2773
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:38,479
we started working with labs trying to

2774
01:37:36,079 --> 01:37:40,719
figure out what we had and what it was

2775
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:41,839
and trying to learn from all the people

2776
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:45,279
like martin lee

2777
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:46,800
and project cbd and dr ethan russo

2778
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:48,719
and learning all of this and when i

2779
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,719
started growing cbd strains when i take

2780
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:52,880
it into a dispensary i say hey i grew

2781
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:54,639
this great flower outdoors

2782
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,079
but it doesn't really have much thc it

2783
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:57,760
won't get you high

2784
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:59,600
and nobody understood what i was talking

2785
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,320
about and so we had to

2786
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:03,679
educate ourselves to be able to educate

2787
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:06,079
the purchasers

2788
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:07,760
and then we had to go and educate the

2789
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:08,559
customers so that they knew what was

2790
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,960
happening

2791
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,320
and so that just let us down a path of

2792
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:14,480
self-education

2793
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:16,000
to where we started doing free trainings

2794
01:38:14,479 --> 01:38:18,238
and in the last 10 years i've been a

2795
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,319
member of over a thousand dispensaries

2796
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:22,238
we offer free cannabis education to

2797
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:24,559
anybody who will listen it'll be a group

2798
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:26,238
of one or a hundred or however many

2799
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:27,600
and then in the meantime we share we

2800
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:28,399
want this information to be out there

2801
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,920
for free

2802
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:31,679
just like we want the plant to be out

2803
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:33,600
there for everybody we're building

2805
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:38,159
in history where we

2806
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:40,880
get to create the universe that we need

2807

and that we should have and it's for all

2808

2810
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:47,839
up till now we are just now getting

2811
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:48,400
through the survival phase where we can

2812
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,440
start

2813
01:38:48,399 --> 01:38:54,479
helping and institutionalize compassion

2814
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:57,039

2819
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,279
quality cannabis

2820
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:07,118
and we don't have to use this shit from

2821
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:08,639
the university of mississippi

2822
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:10,799
and but there's a lot of us out there

2823
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:12,719
and i can't tell you how excited i am

2824
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:15,039
when i teach classes on acidic

2825
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:16,279
cannabinoids i can go into a dispensary

2826
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:17,840
now and i don't have to explain what

2827
01:39:16,279 --> 01:39:19,519
decarboxylation is

2828
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,039
i don't have to explain to the majority

2829
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,920
of people what the endocannabinoid

2830
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:23,439
system is

2831
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,800
now we can get to the fine-tune things

2832
01:39:23,439 --> 01:39:26,079
where you were talking about the

2833
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,960
dopamine and serotonin

2834
01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:31,359
levels in somebody we know that a good

2835
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:33,039
level of cbd combined with thc and the

2836
01:39:31,359 --> 01:39:35,519
other cannabinoids and terpenes

2837
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:37,039
helps balance out serotonin dopamine and

2838
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:39,760
other neurotransmitters c

2839
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:40,560
don't spike so you don't crash and a lot

2840
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,159
of the people

2841
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,840
problems that people are having are

2842
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:44,879
because their endocannabinoid system is

2843
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,360
out of whack

2844
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:49,039
and but we are we're making a lot of

2845
01:39:47,359 --> 01:39:50,399
great improvements on the education

2846
01:39:49,039 --> 01:39:51,760
level in the country and

2847
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:53,839
it's just all of us getting out there

2848
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:55,119
and telling our stories and talking to

2849
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:57,119
everybody

2850
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:58,479
now my dad's a 100 percent disabled

2851
01:39:57,118 --> 01:40:00,880
vietnam vet

2852
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:02,799
he was blown up in country he was a

2853
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,719
marine corps infantry officer

2854
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:06,639
and turned the entire right side of his

2855
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:08,719
body into chewed bubble gum and he spent

2856
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:11,840
a year in a body cast in japan

2857
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:12,480
uh before he came home and i grew up

2858
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,880
with

2859
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:15,839
him medicating with alcohol and pills

2860
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,359
and

2861
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:19,279
you know he was a great dad he was my

2862
01:40:17,359 --> 01:40:21,198
scout leader but he was always in pain

2863
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:22,479
and he was always suffering and

2864
01:40:21,198 --> 01:40:24,158
be damned if you tell them about

2865
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:24,638
post-traumatic stress that's you know

2866
01:40:24,158 --> 01:40:26,238

2867
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:27,679
doesn't happen to marine corps infantry

2868
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:30,000

2869
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:32,079

2872
01:40:34,079 --> 01:40:36,639

2873
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,560
on your back

2874
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:40,239
after you get right inside the door

2875
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:42,639

2876
01:40:40,238 --> 01:40:43,839
um but i grew up with disabled vets and

2877
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:46,639
watching all of them

2878

2880
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,679

2908

started creating our own district

2909
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:53,119
company because nobody could talk about

2910

cannabinoids and cbd cbda whole plant

2911

2967
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:52,159
ourselves

2968
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:54,079
because i get what colin was saying

2969
01:43:52,158 --> 01:43:55,198
earlier he's like we have to do it

2970
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:57,679
ourselves because

2971
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:58,479
you know again walk the walk it's like

2972
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:00,480
get out there

2973
01:43:58,479 --> 01:44:02,238
we we tried to contract people to make

2974
01:44:00,479 --> 01:44:04,158
it happen and we couldn't get it done so

2975
01:44:02,238 --> 01:44:07,198
we're going to build it ourselves

2976
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:09,679
and that's just basically and and me and

2977
01:44:07,198 --> 01:44:11,118
and our alignment is that's again i

2978
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:12,960
think with you you know it's everything

2979
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:13,920
is it coming to a gather for a point

2980
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:15,439
here where we all

2981
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:17,440
are intertwined with each other now

2982
01:44:15,439 --> 01:44:19,919
where we know each other where

2983
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:21,678
you know you need access you reach out

2984
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:23,840
you know we need to get to your your

2985
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:26,158
market we're going to reach out to you

2986
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:28,480
these kind of things where we can all

2987
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:29,439
expand what we're doing for the greater

2988
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:31,118
good you know for

2989
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:32,559
you hit it on the head doc it's about

2990
01:44:31,118 --> 01:44:35,198
access access

2991
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:36,960
access access if i give somebody your

2992
01:44:35,198 --> 01:44:39,839
pineapple barry kush

2993
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:40,719
and it helps a veteran i need to ensure

2994
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,440
that they can

2995
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:45,118
access it whenever they need it because

2996
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:45,678
they don't need it just every now and

2997
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:48,719
then

2998
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:48,719
and so it kills me

2999
01:44:53,118 --> 01:44:56,559
it just goes away you know it goes so

3000
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:58,079
quickly as i want to get it into the

3001
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,840
hands of people

3002
01:44:58,079 --> 01:45:01,679
like where i don't mind being part of it

3003
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,119
but i'm too old to do it myself i need

3004
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:04,639
young men and women that want to get

3005
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:05,439
their hands dirty and want to learn how

3006
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:07,920
to cultivate

3007
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:08,799
cannabis to come up to the middle of

3008
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,560
nowhere in the

3009
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:12,239
in the wild woods and the mountainside

3010
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:14,480
with me and and the guy

3011
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:16,718
the other bearded guy on and you know he

3012
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:18,479
me more than anybody you know

3013
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:20,480
we're building a thing together but it's

3014
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:21,919
like i i get what he's doing where he's

3015
01:45:20,479 --> 01:45:23,759
at in sonoma

3016
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:26,480
to where we're where we're looking at up

3017
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:28,320
in northern mendo in southern humboldt

3018
01:45:26,479 --> 01:45:30,079
you know that's a three-hour gap you

3019
01:45:28,319 --> 01:45:30,399
know it's like i have people that are

3020
01:45:30,079 --> 01:45:32,158
vet

3021
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:34,000

3022
01:45:32,158 --> 01:45:35,279
gonna that are i've already told me that

3023

that are good at their craft that want

3024
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:38,479
to learn underneath me that are willing

3025
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:40,880
to come from where they are around the

3026
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:43,519
world to come be a part of this deal

3027
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:45,440
yeah information for free we want to

3028
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,320
make sure that everybody has access we

3029
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:48,799
want to be

3030
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:50,559
educating people especially veterans to

3031
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,679
come into the industry and have a level

3032
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:53,679
of education

3033
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:58,000
we want to make sure that access to

3034
01:45:53,679 --> 01:46:00,239
continuous medicine

3035
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,000
for veterans there's no better business

3036
01:46:00,238 --> 01:46:02,638
that i can suggest to veterans to go

3037
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,039
work in

3038
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:05,920
cannabis yeah it's the best absolutely

3039
01:46:05,039 --> 01:46:09,198
right now

3040
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:13,039
i because even the acts

3041
01:46:09,198 --> 01:46:16,000
the act of growing is therapeutic

3042
01:46:13,039 --> 01:46:16,960
yes oh getting your hands in the soil

3043
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,719
and touching it

3044
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,399
getting connected to the ground and

3045
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:22,319
putting your hands in the soil

3046
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:24,559
that plant will tell you everything she

3047
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:26,000
needs she will be on her tippy toes

3048
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:28,080
smiling when everything's going

3049
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,679
well she may be looking away or drooping

3050
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:31,039
a little bit when she needs some water

3051
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:32,719
or love or attention

3052
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:35,118
but that connection and that love with

3053
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:37,279
that plant is just it

3054
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:38,719
it's very important and i think

3055
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:41,279
everybody should grow it

3056
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:42,719
cannabis is an amazing phenomenal from

3057
01:46:41,279 --> 01:46:45,439
the bottom up medicine

3058
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:46,000
and it grows on trees so why can't we

3059
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:47,919
make sure

3060
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,520
everybody grows it if somebody your

3061
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:50,719
friend can't grow it give them someone

3062
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:52,320
who have you grown

3063
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:54,158
this needs to be community from the

3064
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:55,759
ground up everybody should have access

3065
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:57,439
everybody should be able to grow it

3066
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:59,440
everybody should be able to sell it as

3067
01:46:57,439 --> 01:47:01,678
long as it's tested and clean

3068
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:03,279
but this this needs to be none of this

3069
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:04,239
trickle down bullshit this is from the

3070
01:47:03,279 --> 01:47:05,519
ground up

3071
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:07,519
this is what's going to elevate the

3072
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,159
community from one end to the other this

3073
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:11,840
is something that

3074
01:47:08,158 --> 01:47:13,920
everybody can do amen and it comes back

3075
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:15,679
to like what does a farmer look like

3076
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:17,679
what does a scientist look like what

3077
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:18,079
does a veteran look like in this day and

3078
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:20,399
age

3079
01:47:18,079 --> 01:47:22,158
it can be anyone and if you can empower

3080
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:24,960
yourself in these amazing

3081
01:47:22,158 --> 01:47:26,238
amazing ways to heal not just yourself

3082
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,800
but your community and i

3083

3084
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:33,440
pose the to the question to the group

3085
01:47:31,039 --> 01:47:34,479
is and i know you guys have tried to do

3086
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:36,559

so that there is never not a need i know

3097
01:47:55,198 --> 01:47:58,479
this is

3098
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:00,000
difficult but it is a start what do you

3099
01:47:58,479 --> 01:48:02,079
guys think there's there's small

3100
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,679
it's going on it's already especially

3101
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:05,840
here in sonoma county

3102
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,520
we have several uh cultivation groups

3103
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:10,719
that are people who got pushed out

3104
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:12,400
uh from 215 into 64 and they all rally

3105
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:13,600
and share tips they meet every tuesday

3106

3108
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,840
information

3109
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:19,520
and we're trying to create that

3110
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:20,000
community we can share the information

3111
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,840
where

3112
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,840

3113
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:25,360

3121
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:38,158
and we're just now getting to the point

3122
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:40,639
where we can stick our heads up

3123
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:42,158
and see who we who we have in fact here

3124

01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:53,920
lobbyist

3131
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,079
we're all in the infancy stages of these

3132
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,679
we need to get the granges going in

3133
01:48:56,079 --> 01:48:59,359
every single county and system

3134
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:01,440
these are community halls where you can

3135
01:48:59,359 --> 01:49:04,238
share information and have classes

3136
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:04,638
and hold events that we can do outside

3137
01:49:04,238 --> 01:49:06,479
of

3138
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:08,800
any traditional market where it's

3139
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:11,118
designed for community and farming

3140
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:12,960
um and then finding everything

3141
01:49:11,118 --> 01:49:14,719
downstream where this can go

3142
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:17,359
but we're we're just now getting out of

3143
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:19,520
this shell shock survival mode from 64.

3144
01:49:17,359 --> 01:49:21,598
and we're still battling every day and i

3145
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:22,639
know it it's we could say it's greed in

3146
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:25,199
the industry

3147
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:27,520
but speaking i i do cultivation

3148
01:49:25,198 --> 01:49:29,759
manufacturing and distribution

3149
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,639
and we get fucked every step of the way

3150
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,159
it's yeah

3151
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:33,920
this is the most difficult thing i've

3152
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:36,399
ever done in my life and

3153
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:38,239
every day it's demoralizing in fact i

3154
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:39,118
use a great marine corps motto with all

3155
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:42,879
of our crew

3156
01:49:39,118 --> 01:49:44,719
embrace the suck the suck

3157
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:46,400
love it wrap your arms around it and

3158
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:48,239
every time they fuck you you say thank

3159
01:49:46,399 --> 01:49:49,439
you sir may i have another

3160
01:49:48,238 --> 01:49:51,439
and we're going to beat them at their

3161
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:53,198
own game we're winning in every district

3162
01:49:51,439 --> 01:49:53,839
where there is no delivery no cannabis

3163
01:49:53,198 --> 01:49:55,359
allowed

3164
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:56,960
but we have to show up we have to be at

3165
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:58,719
board of supervisors meetings we have to

3166
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,158
be at city council meetings you got to

3167
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:02,719
show up to sacramento

3168
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:05,439
you got to tell you know old aunt bessie

3169
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:08,000
who is a staunch anti-cannabis person

3170
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:08,638
explain it time after time or my dad i

3171
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,158
said he

3172
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:12,480
never touched cannabis his entire life

3173
01:50:10,158 --> 01:50:12,960
he was very anti and i just had to go

3174
01:50:12,479 --> 01:50:14,559
home

3175
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:16,480
last month and help him get his leg

3176
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:19,199
amputated um

3177
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:21,198
above the knee and uh he has been

3178
01:50:19,198 --> 01:50:23,519
anti-cannabis his whole life and the va

3179
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:24,960
has he refuses to go to the va from the

3180
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:27,360
treatment he got there

3181
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:28,880
and he was in pain and he was having

3182
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:31,598
issues with opioids

3183
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:33,760
and life was miserable for him and he

3184
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:35,440
finally after 20 years of us debating on

3185
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:37,520
the efficacy of cannabis

3186
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:39,439
he allowed me to give him some cannabis

3187
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:39,920
to try it was the first night he slept

3188
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:42,799
in

3189
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:43,359
in years he sat and so if we can

3190
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:46,079
convince

3191
01:50:43,359 --> 01:50:47,839
that old man that cannabis isn't the you

3192
01:50:46,079 --> 01:50:50,000
know the devil's weed

3193
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:51,440
and then we can convince other people we

3194
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,479
just have to meet them at their level of

3195
01:50:51,439 --> 01:50:54,079
understanding

3196
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:55,839
and give them enough digestible

3197
01:50:54,079 --> 01:50:56,880
information and share the resources

3198
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,880
where we get it from

3199
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:00,400
don't come out and say this is going to

3200
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,960
heal the world and see it does

3201
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:03,679
everything

3202
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:05,679
no cannabis slows your body down so it

3203
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:08,000
heals itself and this is how

3204
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:10,639
we know what it does and just break it

3205
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,719
down into simple conversational things

3206
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:14,319
we do more sharing our stories every day

3207
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:16,239
to people we meet than

3208
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:17,599
you know a lot of other outlets so we

3209
01:51:16,238 --> 01:51:20,158
just need to make sure that we're

3210
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:22,000
creating other people to go out there

3211
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:24,158
and share their stories we just need to

3212
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,479
create good stories that can be shared

3213
01:51:24,158 --> 01:51:27,279
the bottom line is our country through

3214
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:29,039
jim crow

3215
01:51:27,279 --> 01:51:30,719
through segregation through the war on

3216
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:33,679
drugs through everything

3217
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:34,960
did a really really good job of putting

3218
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:37,039
cannabis down

3219
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:38,719
like a good job to the point where

3220
01:51:37,039 --> 01:51:42,238
people like your friend

3221
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:44,960
or of 20 years it's ingrained that it's

3222
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:46,799
bad it's bad it's bad it's bad we need

3223
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:49,599
to do an even better job

3224
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:50,400
than they ever did of unifying creating

3225
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:52,560
communities

3226
01:51:50,399 --> 01:51:55,519
and and speaking our truths like you're

3227
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:58,639
saying couldn't have said it better cam

3228
01:51:55,520 --> 01:52:00,320
just quickly it it seems like

3229
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:02,719
you know we've been talking about kind

3230
01:52:00,319 --> 01:52:03,279
of the roots and momentum from the

3231
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:06,560
bottom

3232
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:09,519
and you know i view it as like a

3233
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:10,880
you know an iceberg kind of it's moving

3234
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:14,159
in a direction and

3235
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:16,239
whether it's moving too slowly is

3236
01:52:14,158 --> 01:52:17,598
a moot point because it's happening like

3237
01:52:16,238 --> 01:52:19,519
you guys are going to touch more

3238
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:20,079
veterans and we'll touch more and more

3239
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:22,880
and

3240
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:24,399
more people will try it and then become

3241
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:26,800
evangelists but

3242
01:52:24,399 --> 01:52:29,679
let's talk about the other side which is

3243
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:32,400
the top down we touched on the va

3244
01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:34,319
can can you guys offer some tactical

3245
01:52:32,399 --> 01:52:35,759
ideas and not just the va i mean think

3246
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:37,679
about each of you were in different

3247
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:39,840
branches of the military

3248
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:42,560
so how do you put pressure on them is

3249
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:43,360
there like one individual who's blocking

3250
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:45,599
progress

3251
01:52:43,359 --> 01:52:47,118
is it you know for example like if in a

3252
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:50,079
county the sheriff is

3253
01:52:47,118 --> 01:52:51,679
mitch mcconnell mitch mcconnell is

3254
01:52:50,079 --> 01:52:54,559
blocking progress

3255
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:58,719
that's who's blocking progress because

3256
01:52:54,560 --> 01:53:02,239
he loves hemp and not cannabis

3257
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:04,158
the the the the bill is sitting there

3258
01:53:02,238 --> 01:53:05,759
again where is it where's the hold up at

3259
01:53:04,158 --> 01:53:07,759
is it sitting right there they're trying

3260
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:10,880
to vote on it right now to

3261
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:12,079
turn it into to decriminalize it to take

3262
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:13,599
it off the regulation

3263
01:53:12,079 --> 01:53:15,118
and it's getting voted on they just that

3264
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:16,960
they're voting on it sometime in the

3265
01:53:15,118 --> 01:53:18,799
next couple of weeks i believe

3266
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:20,880
but it's got to get past mcconnell's

3267
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:24,079
desk that's the truth of the matter

3268
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:26,400
and this i only said that to say this

3269
01:53:24,079 --> 01:53:28,559
it is small grassroots and how do we do

3270
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:30,479
it you change your politicians

3271
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:32,960
if they're not pro-cannabis you broke

3272
01:53:30,479 --> 01:53:35,359
their ass out and you put a pro-cannabis

3273
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:37,198
person into that seat

3274
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:39,759
and that's what i'm getting at which is

3275
01:53:37,198 --> 01:53:42,158
you know even a county the sheriff

3276
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:44,320
loves doing raids on cannabis farmers

3277
01:53:42,158 --> 01:53:47,039
well that guy comes up for re-election

3278
01:53:44,319 --> 01:53:49,118
every once in a while so

3279
01:53:47,039 --> 01:53:51,760
thinking of all these different groups

3280
01:53:49,118 --> 01:53:55,039
that we need to change the va

3281
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:58,239
is one so my question is like is the va

3282
01:53:55,039 --> 01:54:00,800
a monolith where like the west la va

3283
01:53:58,238 --> 01:54:02,000
just has to go by the orders of the

3284
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:05,039
national va

3285
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:08,960
or is each local va

3286
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:10,319
its own kind of silo of decision making

3287
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:14,000
where they could be a little more

3288
01:54:10,319 --> 01:54:14,000
tolerant or a little less tolerant

3289
01:54:14,158 --> 01:54:18,079
i will i'll address that personally uh

3290
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:20,238
it is

3291
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:21,519
specifically that it depends on whether

3292
01:54:20,238 --> 01:54:24,000
the specific

3293
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:24,639
community-based outreach program is out

3294
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
here here

3295
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:29,920
here where we're at is uh the seabock in

3296
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,760
eureka specifically like my

3297
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:34,000
physicians there my primary care and

3298
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:35,440
people they all know i use the plan i

3299
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,439
don't take synthetics

3300
01:54:35,439 --> 01:54:39,439
you go to another state where they don't

3301
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:41,359
have the same kind of compassion laws

3302
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:43,759
or depth of understanding like we do

3303
01:54:41,359 --> 01:54:46,158
because this is a humboldt county

3304
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,960
freaking facility that's a lot of what

3305
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:49,198
it is

3306
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:50,000
it's right down to the personal level of

3307
01:54:49,198 --> 01:54:52,238
what the how the

3308
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,399
doctor interprets how the bill is

3309
01:54:52,238 --> 01:54:57,118
written and how the regulations are

3310
01:54:54,399 --> 01:54:58,799
written within the va it's but again

3311
01:54:57,118 --> 01:55:00,559
depending on where you're at it's up to

3312
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:02,480
personal interpretation of your

3313
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:04,000
freaking position but my personal

3314
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:04,959
primary care literally the last time i

3315
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,719
was in there

3316
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:08,000
he's asking me about what i'm

3317
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:10,158
cultivating

3318
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,719
okay and this is all happening and in

3319
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:13,839
just the last few years

3320
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:15,359
you know i'm going to say it's not

3321
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:17,440
immediately so i'm not but i'm going to

3322
01:55:15,359 --> 01:55:20,319
say in places where they're not

3323
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:21,839
in the middle of the mecca for cannabis

3324
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:23,279
and northern california then

3325
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:25,039
obviously it's gonna you're not gonna

3326
01:55:23,279 --> 01:55:26,639
get the same kind of pro approach

3327
01:55:25,039 --> 01:55:28,479
someplace else

3328
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:30,480
i believe in places where compassion

3329
01:55:28,479 --> 01:55:32,399
laws are in place

3330
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:34,319
where the doctors can talk to bet about

3331
01:55:32,399 --> 01:55:36,399
cannabis with the veterans

3332
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:37,519
it's tough because if you're rated and

3333
01:55:36,399 --> 01:55:39,039
you're not 100

3334
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:40,480
secured in your rating they can mess

3335
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:41,599
with your rating and take your money

3336
01:55:40,479 --> 01:55:43,519
away from you

3337
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:45,599
that's a serious consideration for a lot

3338
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:47,679
of people colin's not in that boat i'm

3339
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:49,920
not in that boat you know it's like

3340
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:51,199
we're beyond those points where we are

3341
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:53,039
with it but there was a point where it

3342
01:55:51,198 --> 01:55:54,399
would have affected me too you know it's

3343
01:55:53,039 --> 01:55:56,238
like i have to be careful

3344
01:55:54,399 --> 01:55:58,799
you know it's like we all have to be

3345
01:55:56,238 --> 01:56:01,359
aware of what the laws are around us

3346
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:02,719
not not expose ourselves to any kind of

3347
01:56:01,359 --> 01:56:05,519
risk if you're not 100

3348
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:07,359
sure don't expose yourself i believe we

3349
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:08,880
have enough legal people around us now

3350
01:56:07,359 --> 01:56:12,000
civilian legal people

3351
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:13,920
and veteran lawyers to get advice from

3352
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,520
where it isn't going to cost you 250 or

3353
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:16,960
a thousand dollars an hour to find out

3354
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:18,080
if it's safe for you to talk to somebody

3355
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:19,359
in your state

3356
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:20,960
that's part of the other things we need

3357
01:56:19,359 --> 01:56:21,519
to start be working on i believe as a

3358
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:24,399
group

3359
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:26,159
okay so this is these are things that i

3360
01:56:24,399 --> 01:56:28,319
think on a

3361
01:56:26,158 --> 01:56:30,638
broader national level that we need to

3362
01:56:28,319 --> 01:56:32,158
be because california again we're all

3363
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:33,840
west coast man

3364
01:56:32,158 --> 01:56:35,279
we're living this bubble out here you

3365
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:38,079
know we've 20

3366
01:56:35,279 --> 01:56:40,479
whatever 24 years of medical cannabis

3367
01:56:38,079 --> 01:56:43,198
now this is 96 you know

3368
01:56:40,479 --> 01:56:44,799
it's just that so much has changed in

3369
01:56:43,198 --> 01:56:46,238
where we've been in these things for so

3370
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:48,400
long where our doctors are

3371
01:56:46,238 --> 01:56:49,359
are way more lenient in the north i

3372
01:56:48,399 --> 01:56:49,920
don't know about the southern half of

3373
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:51,439
the state

3374
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:54,399
but you get north san francisco and

3375
01:56:51,439 --> 01:56:56,158
coming up cannabis is a way of life up

3376
01:56:54,399 --> 01:56:58,000
in the northern half of the state

3377
01:56:56,158 --> 01:56:59,920
yeah i mean it's just how it is it's

3378
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,158
like i i believe all our doctors

3379
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:03,199
are understanding of it maybe not

3380
01:57:02,158 --> 01:57:05,279
completely

3381
01:57:03,198 --> 01:57:06,399
receptive to it but at least sympathetic

3382
01:57:05,279 --> 01:57:09,679
of it yeah and

3383
01:57:06,399 --> 01:57:11,439
and i know colin's experience with with

3384
01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:12,399
l.a and stuff is again a different

3385
01:57:11,439 --> 01:57:14,719
portion of the cut

3386
01:57:12,399 --> 01:57:16,158
the state and just a different mindset

3387
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:17,760
of the doctors so it's going to go down

3388
01:57:16,158 --> 01:57:21,359
to what each individual doctor

3389
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:23,199
is within your va best advice

3390
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:24,559
don't say anything about your cannabis

3391
01:57:23,198 --> 01:57:26,319
use until you're 100

3392
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:28,080
sure you can you know unless you live in

3393
01:57:26,319 --> 01:57:28,399
a community like where i live out or you

3394
01:57:28,079 --> 01:57:30,238
look

3395
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:31,439
you know your doctors are 100 cro pro

3396
01:57:30,238 --> 01:57:32,559
cannabis they're not going to put it in

3397
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:33,919
your records

3398
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:35,760
but you're putting your records you're

3399
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:36,639
screwed right now and again it boils

3400
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:38,560
down to

3401
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:39,679
we got to get mitch mcconnell either out

3402
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:41,840
of the office or

3403
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:43,440
change his mindset and get this bill

3404
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:45,199
change on schedule one

3405
01:57:43,439 --> 01:57:46,960
the schedule one that is that's no

3406
01:57:45,198 --> 01:57:49,198
medical value is bullshit

3407
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:50,960
and we all know it's bullshit and we

3408
01:57:49,198 --> 01:57:52,000
need our medical professionals our

3409
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:54,239
scientists

3410
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,359
our legislators and again if they aren't

3411
01:57:54,238 --> 01:57:57,678
pro-cannabis then

3412
01:57:55,359 --> 01:57:58,880
vote them out and put somebody in who is

3413
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:01,840
pro-cannabis

3414
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:03,679
because this is again i hate to be this

3415
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:05,679
way but this is about control

3416
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:06,960
and greed and corruption and that is the

3417
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:09,599
truth of the matter

3418
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:11,279
it's a it's everything you know keeping

3419
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:13,760
keeping the masses under control

3420
01:58:11,279 --> 01:58:17,118
incarceration it all ties into it

3421
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:19,119
how many how many how many non-violent

3422
01:58:17,118 --> 01:58:20,880
first offenders are in federal prison

3423
01:58:19,118 --> 01:58:22,639
over cannabis you know it's like it's

3424
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:24,480
just freaking ridiculous

3425
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:25,679
there's people that instilled the was

3426
01:58:24,479 --> 01:58:27,919
that the last

3427
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:29,760
last prisoner project that is steve

3428
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:30,960
d'angelo's project isn't that what that

3429
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:33,039
one is right

3430
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:35,760
it's ridiculous over joints you know

3431
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:37,039
it's like 25 years for a freaking joint

3432
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:39,039
are you out of your fucking mind what

3433
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:40,639
the wrong is of this country how does he

3434
01:58:39,039 --> 01:58:42,238
you know how do we do this you know it's

3435
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:43,920
like i'm getting on

3436
01:58:42,238 --> 01:58:45,919
kind of off point here a little bit but

3437
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:48,000
this really is what it boils down to is

3438
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:49,599
we have to vote with our conscience we

3439
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,800
have to even if you don't tell people

3440
01:58:49,599 --> 01:58:53,279
you smoke weed

3441
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:55,039
and you use that plant you need to talk

3442
01:58:53,279 --> 01:58:55,679
to your politicians and vote for those

3443
01:58:55,039 --> 01:58:58,639
people who

3444
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:59,679
are that way and if they're not don't

3445
01:58:58,639 --> 01:59:01,199
vote for them

3446
01:58:59,679 --> 01:59:02,719
you know it's like here the trinity

3447
01:59:01,198 --> 01:59:05,839
county sheriff last year

3448
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:07,760
mom and pops with 30 to 40 50 000 worth

3449
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:08,480
of paid permits with their papers in

3450
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:10,480
their hands

3451
01:59:08,479 --> 01:59:12,638
having federal agents kick their gates

3452
01:59:10,479 --> 01:59:14,238
in and go we don't care what your damn

3453
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:15,359
papers say we're here to knock your

3454
01:59:14,238 --> 01:59:17,439
plants down

3455
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:19,198
that's bullshit man well that's an

3456
01:59:17,439 --> 01:59:20,879
elected official that's an elected

3457
01:59:19,198 --> 01:59:22,799
sheriff at trinity county

3458
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:25,359
vote that son of a bitch out and put

3459
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:28,000
somebody in who is pro-cannabis

3460
01:59:25,359 --> 01:59:28,639
that's how it works here it's how it

3461
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,118
works here

3462
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:32,880
our county our county sheriff is 100

3463
01:59:31,118 --> 01:59:36,079
behind mom and pops

3464
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:37,760
100 behind what we do here they won't

3465
01:59:36,079 --> 01:59:38,479
accept the funds they don't allow it to

3466
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:41,360
happen here

3467
01:59:38,479 --> 01:59:43,839
it's a long time coming yeah been

3468
01:59:41,359 --> 01:59:45,839
handcuffed been pepper sprayed before

3469
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:47,520
was it that way 20 years ago you know

3470
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:51,440
when the laws first changed in the early

3471
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:54,800
in the late 1990s it wasn't that way

3472
01:59:51,439 --> 01:59:56,879
so so there were talking about kind of

3473
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:58,480
elected officials and voting them in and

3474
01:59:56,880 --> 02:00:01,039
out like uh

3475
01:59:58,479 --> 02:00:03,118
i'm gonna take the concrete example of

3476
02:00:01,039 --> 02:00:05,519
the west la va

3477
02:00:03,118 --> 02:00:07,519
where it's not elected doctors it's not

3478
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:12,000
elected administrators

3479
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:14,360
um colin would it be possible to create

3480
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,319
you know if veterans in different

3481
02:00:14,359 --> 02:00:18,158
municipalities created lists

3482
02:00:16,319 --> 02:00:19,519
like could we create lists of the

3483
02:00:18,158 --> 02:00:22,000
doctors who are kind of

3484
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:23,040
on staff at the va's and then have some

3485
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,760
sort of

3486
02:00:23,039 --> 02:00:27,840
constant trying to outreach to them and

3487
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:30,000
invite them to local events

3488
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:32,159
and see if they'll you know because it

3489
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:34,319
just takes one domino to be like

3490
02:00:32,158 --> 02:00:35,759
i'll come to that event and like meet

3491
02:00:34,319 --> 02:00:38,799
and listen and talk about

3492
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:41,280
medical and cannabis and i'm a va doctor

3493
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:43,679
and then he goes back and tells like

3494
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:45,279
one of the other va doctors at west l.a

3495
02:00:43,679 --> 02:00:47,440
like i was at this thing and it was

3496
02:00:45,279 --> 02:00:50,158
actually pretty interesting and

3497
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:52,000
you know you're just moving mindsets a

3498
02:00:50,158 --> 02:00:54,799
little bit at a time

3499
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,599
yeah we we try and that's you know

3500
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:58,159
exactly

3501
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:59,520
what we strive to do at veterans walk

3502
02:00:58,158 --> 02:01:02,238
and talk with no

3503
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:04,320
um non-profit flag with no business

3504
02:01:02,238 --> 02:01:05,279
license so that we can just subvert from

3505
02:01:04,319 --> 02:01:07,599
the inside

3506
02:01:05,279 --> 02:01:09,920
you can't go to a va in southern

3507
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:11,599
california or oklahoma and not find

3508
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:13,599
veterans walk and talk literature we

3509
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:14,800
drop it off routinely i have people who

3510
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:17,199
do it for me

3511
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:19,119
um but the fact of the matter is like

3512
02:01:17,198 --> 02:01:21,198
what doc said is that

3513
02:01:19,118 --> 02:01:23,118
as long as veterans are too afraid to

3514
02:01:21,198 --> 02:01:24,559
talk to their medical professionals

3515
02:01:23,118 --> 02:01:26,319
about cannabis

3516
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:28,080
there are going to be no chances for

3517
02:01:26,319 --> 02:01:30,158
medical professionals to leave the

3518
02:01:28,079 --> 02:01:32,079
grounds to learn about cannabis because

3519
02:01:30,158 --> 02:01:35,359
their jobs are at stake as well

3520
02:01:32,079 --> 02:01:37,920
the flip side to that is ucla

3521
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:39,198
i know first act has partnered with the

3522
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:42,319
west la va

3523
02:01:39,198 --> 02:01:45,439
to do more research on cannabis

3524
02:01:42,319 --> 02:01:49,679
um they have the canada club

3525
02:01:45,439 --> 02:01:53,039
at usc and ucla i have personally been

3526
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:55,840
to ucla run uh

3527
02:01:53,039 --> 02:01:58,238
operations several of them um cannabis

3528
02:01:55,840 --> 02:02:01,760
operations and i can tell you

3529
02:01:58,238 --> 02:02:05,118
i can tell you wholeheartedly that uh

3530
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:05,520
they're lacking um i've been one of them

3531
02:02:05,118 --> 02:02:08,238
was

3532
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:09,760
was up to par the other one is just

3533
02:02:08,238 --> 02:02:12,638
embarrassing so

3534
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:14,079
but you're you're right on the money um

3535
02:02:12,639 --> 02:02:17,520
you know

3536
02:02:14,079 --> 02:02:21,519
the va works based on

3537
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:23,679
results so as long as they are showing

3538
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:26,159
some kind of result in a field that

3539
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:29,359
field will continue to get funded

3540
02:02:26,158 --> 02:02:30,960
which is why they make us interview for

3541
02:02:29,359 --> 02:02:33,598
a bed

3542
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:34,239
and that we have to actually qualify for

3543
02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:37,279
because then

3544
02:02:34,238 --> 02:02:40,718
our position is more likely to

3545
02:02:37,279 --> 02:02:43,519
fruit them a positive of a positive

3546
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:44,399
outcome and therefore they will get more

3547
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:48,639
funding

3548
02:02:44,399 --> 02:02:50,799
um so yeah it's it's from the top

3549
02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:52,239
up that's where it has to be when you

3550
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:54,800
have like i said again

3551
02:02:52,238 --> 02:02:56,319
people like shulkin writing books entire

3552
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:57,760
books about how they tried to

3553
02:02:56,319 --> 02:03:00,238
change the va and couldn't do it from

3554
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:01,119
the top down you know that a subversive

3555
02:03:00,238 --> 02:03:03,279
movement has to

3556
02:03:01,118 --> 02:03:05,198
has to take part and with mitch

3557
02:03:03,279 --> 02:03:06,399
mcconnell and the moore act and all that

3558
02:03:05,198 --> 02:03:09,519
stuff the va

3559
02:03:06,399 --> 02:03:10,238
the va it's all all lumped into the same

3560
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:12,719
thing

3561
02:03:10,238 --> 02:03:14,000
the fact of the matter is that americans

3562
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:16,319
are incapable of

3563
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,319
admitting that we got something wrong to

3564
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:21,920
the point where

3565
02:03:18,319 --> 02:03:23,519
they are terrified of having to admit

3566
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:25,359
that these people were behind bars for

3567
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,520
the wrong reasons they are terrified of

3568
02:03:25,359 --> 02:03:28,960
having to pay reparations to these

3569
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:31,040
people once they are out

3570
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:33,039
they are terrified of generational

3571
02:03:31,039 --> 02:03:34,960
conflict that they will have to face

3572
02:03:33,039 --> 02:03:38,079
because of families uprooted

3573
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:39,599
over single plants single joints quarter

3574
02:03:38,079 --> 02:03:42,479
ounces of cannabis

3575
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:43,599
these are mistakes that america made

3576
02:03:42,479 --> 02:03:45,839
there are mistakes

3577
02:03:43,599 --> 02:03:47,440
that they did to their own people they

3578
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:48,960
are mistakes that they need to be

3579
02:03:47,439 --> 02:03:50,399
accounted for just like they were

3580
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,840
accounted for vietnam

3581
02:03:50,399 --> 02:03:53,519
and they accounted for they need to

3582
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:55,199
account for afghanistan and the fact

3583
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:56,560
that they keep us there just to make

3584
02:03:55,198 --> 02:03:59,759
money so

3585
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:02,960
these are all top-down issues

3586
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:04,320
and until we vote the people out who are

3587
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:06,800
afraid to admit

3588
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:08,399
that they've made mistakes the mistakes

3589
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:11,679
will continue to happen

3590
02:04:08,399 --> 02:04:14,559
because there's no accountability the

3591
02:04:11,679 --> 02:04:15,920
it's okay for us it's okay for us to say

3592
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:18,480
that va

3593
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:20,239
needs to be reworked it's even okay

3594
02:04:18,479 --> 02:04:21,678
especially from a combat infantry

3595
02:04:20,238 --> 02:04:22,638
veteran who killed people for this

3596
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:24,800
country

3597
02:04:22,639 --> 02:04:26,880
it's okay for us to say that the

3598
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:29,039
constitution needs to be rewritten

3599
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:31,199
that's okay there's nothing wrong with

3600
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:33,039
that there's nothing wrong with looking

3601
02:04:31,198 --> 02:04:34,879
into our roots and finding what worked

3602
02:04:33,039 --> 02:04:36,479
and finding what didn't and taking it

3603
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:39,199
and making it better

3604
02:04:36,479 --> 02:04:40,559
america is scared to do that so our

3605
02:04:39,198 --> 02:04:43,279
health institutions

3606
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:44,719
particularly the va they're terrified to

3607
02:04:43,279 --> 02:04:45,759
empower veterans in a health and

3608
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:47,599
wellness manner

3609
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:49,599
because they know for every veteran

3610
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:53,840
empowered every veteran healed

3611
02:04:49,599 --> 02:04:53,840
they are butterfly affecting 10 more

3612
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:01,599
and that's all sorry my mushrooms my

3613
02:05:00,158 --> 02:05:07,519
mushrooms kicked in so i'm just like

3614
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:08,800
yeah baby let's talk about the va

3615
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:12,239
and if you're wondering what guy

3616
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:12,239
mushrooms looks like it's like this

3617
02:05:13,198 --> 02:05:18,279
no it's not it's like this

3618
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:18,280
[Laughter]

3619
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:22,719
i think what we're doing here is kind of

3620
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:23,679
part of what we're talking about which

3621
02:05:22,719 --> 02:05:26,078
is we can

3622
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:27,440
you know this conversation will reach

3623
02:05:26,078 --> 02:05:30,799
veterans who will be

3624
02:05:27,439 --> 02:05:31,839
impacted by see watching this

3625
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:34,960
conversation

3626
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:37,520
and then we'll also reach bureaucrats

3627
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:39,118
and decision makers who will be impacted

3628
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:41,760
and i'd like to put

3629
02:05:39,118 --> 02:05:42,880
you know more and more pressure on that

3630
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:45,679
front and be really

3631
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:47,279
tactical and it's good to hear like for

3632
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:48,960
example it's interesting that that you

3633
02:05:47,279 --> 02:05:51,359
hand out literature like

3634
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:52,560
do you notice that administrators are

3635
02:05:51,359 --> 02:05:55,118
coming and like

3636
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:56,000
throwing the the pamphlets out or are

3637
02:05:55,118 --> 02:05:58,639
they

3638
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,198
like has there been a transition where

3639
02:05:58,639 --> 02:06:02,319
they're

3640
02:05:59,198 --> 02:06:04,319
allowing it and they're cool with it and

3641
02:06:02,319 --> 02:06:06,719
they're actually happy you're doing it

3642
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:07,599
versus like three years ago when maybe

3643
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:10,560
they

3644
02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:12,319
threw it out as soon as they saw it yeah

3645
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:15,039
but it's all hush hush

3646
02:06:12,319 --> 02:06:17,439
still even even even now i mean i have

3647
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:18,158
to take the cannabis leaves off my logos

3648
02:06:17,439 --> 02:06:20,319
to do this

3649
02:06:18,158 --> 02:06:22,799
and stuff like that every now and then

3650
02:06:20,319 --> 02:06:26,000
like oklahoma to be honest um

3651
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:27,840
as progressive as as we want to pretend

3652
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,238
we are in california and as

3653
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:31,599
far as cannabis goes oklahoma's doing a

3654
02:06:30,238 --> 02:06:34,718
great job of shepherding

3655
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:38,000
the best in the country right now yeah

3656
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:40,158
i agree and so in oklahoma

3657
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,719
they have no problem at the va putting

3658
02:06:40,158 --> 02:06:45,519
my logo up and literature up that's not

3659
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:48,480
been an issue but here in west l.a

3660
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:49,040
because cannabis use is still uh it's

3661
02:06:48,479 --> 02:06:52,479
still a

3662
02:06:49,039 --> 02:06:53,359
dis disqualifying factor to get mental

3663
02:06:52,479 --> 02:06:56,158
health

3664
02:06:53,359 --> 02:06:57,118
treatment so they won't you know they

3665
02:06:56,158 --> 02:06:59,679
they don't want to

3666
02:06:57,118 --> 02:07:01,759
they they call it like you know you have

3667
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:02,560
to clean yourself completely before we

3668
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:04,239
will let you

3669
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:05,679
get here which is just absolutely

3670
02:07:04,238 --> 02:07:08,399
impossible for most people

3671
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:09,520
and there's also why most people in the

3672
02:07:08,399 --> 02:07:12,719
rehab centers

3673
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:13,280
at the va look like me and our white

3674
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:16,078
guys

3675
02:07:13,279 --> 02:07:17,759
who they think will do well and are

3676
02:07:16,078 --> 02:07:19,439
they're not actually given the help to

3677
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:22,560
the people who actually need it

3678
02:07:19,439 --> 02:07:24,319
because of drug use and and racism so

3679
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:25,039
that that's all we could do two hours on

3680
02:07:24,319 --> 02:07:28,639
that as well

3681
02:07:25,039 --> 02:07:31,519
so i i saw veterans die i saw them die

3682
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:33,039
at the va in my arms that my brothers

3683
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:34,719
who i didn't fight with they were

3684
02:07:33,039 --> 02:07:37,439
vietnam vets older

3685
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:38,319
african-american gentlemen die on the

3686
02:07:37,439 --> 02:07:40,960
steps

3687
02:07:38,319 --> 02:07:43,359
of the fucking the home that i lived in

3688
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:45,198
because they weren't allowed access

3689
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:47,039
we we would trace their body we would

3690
02:07:45,198 --> 02:07:47,839
put flowers out there for them because

3691
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:49,118
we had no

3692
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:52,960
we didn't they were there one day and

3693
02:07:49,118 --> 02:07:52,960
they were gone the next just like that

3694
02:07:53,118 --> 02:07:57,198
it's what's wrong it's part of it and

3695
02:07:55,279 --> 02:07:59,118
calling you say we have to own

3696
02:07:57,198 --> 02:08:01,118
our mistakes and we don't do it as a

3697
02:07:59,118 --> 02:08:02,719
country and it's a part of what we're in

3698
02:08:01,118 --> 02:08:04,719
this

3699
02:08:02,719 --> 02:08:07,439
mess that we're in right now currently

3700
02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:09,359
it breaks my fucking heart

3701
02:08:07,439 --> 02:08:11,439
it part i think it breaks all of our

3702
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:13,439
hearts collectively of what we see with

3703
02:08:11,439 --> 02:08:16,000
our brothers and sisters

3704
02:08:13,439 --> 02:08:17,759
that have you know signed a blank check

3705
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,840
at some point in their lives saying

3706
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:22,480
up until and including my wife i'll do

3707
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:25,760
whatever it takes to defend our country

3708
02:08:22,479 --> 02:08:28,879
and we don't honor what

3709
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:30,400
it's supposed to be and that's not

3710
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:31,840
this they're not supposed to be on the

3711
02:08:30,399 --> 02:08:32,479
streets there's not supposed to not have

3712
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:34,239
access

3713
02:08:32,479 --> 02:08:36,238
you know i'm a big believer of how we

3714
02:08:34,238 --> 02:08:39,039
treat the least amongst us it's

3715
02:08:36,238 --> 02:08:39,759
you know that's my my god that's how my

3716
02:08:39,039 --> 02:08:42,078
god looks

3717
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:43,360
you know and and that's how i approach

3718
02:08:42,078 --> 02:08:46,000
this thing with

3719
02:08:43,359 --> 02:08:47,519
with who i try to be around you know who

3720
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,599
i try to share with and

3721
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:51,360
and i didn't quite honestly understand

3722
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:52,719
it until the last couple of years that

3723
02:08:51,359 --> 02:08:55,279
the outpouring of

3724
02:08:52,719 --> 02:08:56,319
of the lack of access to what i do and

3725
02:08:55,279 --> 02:08:57,840
what

3726
02:08:56,319 --> 02:08:59,920
brothers and sisters that i have in my

3727
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:02,480
community here this small little bubble

3728
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:04,000
this utopian cannabis bubble that we

3729
02:09:02,479 --> 02:09:07,678
live in here in the triangle

3730
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:09,920
that you know it's here

3731
02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:11,199
we need to get it beyond them being

3732
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:12,560
scared

3733
02:09:11,198 --> 02:09:14,638
and afraid that they're going to have it

3734
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:15,520
taken away from them which is their

3735
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:17,359
ultimate fear

3736
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:19,280
you know it's my ultimate fear is to

3737
02:09:17,359 --> 02:09:20,639
have what i want my life on taken away

3738
02:09:19,279 --> 02:09:22,960
and some

3739
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:24,159
i'd rather be at a corporate cannabis

3740
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:27,920
company than

3741
02:09:24,158 --> 02:09:30,559
freaking monsanto or dow chemical or

3742
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:32,078
budweiser anheuser-busch you know it's

3743
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:33,599
going to jump in as soon as the

3744
02:09:32,078 --> 02:09:35,599
federal thing changes they're all going

3745
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:38,319
to jump in they're absolutely right doc

3746
02:09:35,599 --> 02:09:39,119
and so many veterans still like joanne i

3747
02:09:38,319 --> 02:09:40,639
was just going to

3748
02:09:39,118 --> 02:09:42,238
throw it to you because we talked about

3749
02:09:40,639 --> 02:09:44,560
this last time i saw you don't

3750
02:09:42,238 --> 02:09:46,319
you we still receive medicine from the

3751
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:47,280
va in order to just keep them off your

3752
02:09:46,319 --> 02:09:51,439
fucking backs

3753
02:09:47,279 --> 02:09:53,279
yeah it's it's a it's a it's a weird

3754
02:09:51,439 --> 02:09:55,039
time right now you know this is a lot

3755
02:09:53,279 --> 02:09:56,399
i and i realized you know i realized

3756
02:09:55,039 --> 02:09:57,920
that earlier this year because people

3757
02:09:56,399 --> 02:09:59,920
were asking questions about what the

3758
02:09:57,920 --> 02:10:01,840
rules were for like i'm right

3759
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:04,158
i'm didn't realize it but i'm the guy

3760
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:06,560
they're getting references for for the

3761
02:10:04,158 --> 02:10:08,879
city of arcata for the editable edibles

3762
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:09,920
guidelines of what milligram dosages are

3763
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:12,000
they're asking me

3764
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:13,599
you know and i was like there isn't

3765
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,039
somebody smarter than me

3766
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:16,719
you know that whole thing and they're

3767
02:10:15,039 --> 02:10:17,920
like well you know you've been good i

3768
02:10:16,719 --> 02:10:20,000
was like all right

3769
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:22,158
this is what i recommend and i'm again

3770
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,800
very conservative because i believe

3771
02:10:22,158 --> 02:10:27,198
personally as a caregiver because that's

3772
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:28,159
my primary focus for the last 23 years

3773
02:10:27,198 --> 02:10:30,960
as a caregiver

3774
02:10:28,158 --> 02:10:33,198
of this of the sacred plant is to always

3775
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:35,279
under prescribe so the experience is an

3776
02:10:33,198 --> 02:10:37,118
uplifting and enjoyable one and they can

3777
02:10:35,279 --> 02:10:37,840
always add more but it's hard to take

3778
02:10:37,118 --> 02:10:40,319
this away

3779
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:42,719
if you over well said so then they were

3780
02:10:40,319 --> 02:10:45,840
asking the right person then

3781
02:10:42,719 --> 02:10:48,880
about them yeah well

3782
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:52,400
that's what they said you start

3783
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:53,118
you know you start um smaller if you go

3784
02:10:52,399 --> 02:10:56,238
all the way

3785
02:10:53,118 --> 02:10:58,000
yeah then you get it consensus was that

3786
02:10:56,238 --> 02:10:58,959
joanne that's really is the consensus

3787
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:02,800
hon that

3788
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:04,000
really is it you know uh we can add more

3789
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:04,560
you know and that really because i have

3790
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,158
friends like

3791
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:07,760

before

3796
02:11:12,399 --> 02:11:16,319
two and a half milligrams of a certain

3797
02:11:14,078 --> 02:11:18,000
kind of compound in this plant could be

3798
02:11:16,319 --> 02:11:20,158
almost too much for them

3799
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,920

of course you know but i want to make

3823
02:11:58,238 --> 02:12:01,678
sure that you're

3824
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:03,119
okay and comfortable with the transition

3825
02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:06,000
from being where you are

3826
02:12:03,118 --> 02:12:08,000
awake and people don't realize how

3827
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:09,039
special and how clearing this plant is

3828
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:11,920
to your mind

3829
02:12:09,039 --> 02:12:13,840
we do as damaged again we as veterans

3830
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:16,000
because we're all damaged

3831
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:18,319
on some level when we when we do embrace

3832
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:20,880
this plan at least how i perceive it is

3833
02:12:18,319 --> 02:12:21,599
there's this clearing what you get it

3834
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:24,159
from it

3835
02:12:21,599 --> 02:12:25,360
joanne calling what you get from it that

3836
02:12:24,158 --> 02:12:27,439
now that you're dialing in that you

3837
02:12:25,359 --> 02:12:32,000
don't want thc heavy plants man

3838
02:12:27,439 --> 02:12:32,000
you know you you can find this works for

3839
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:36,239
you

3840
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:38,639
i was just saying just for now i will

3841
02:12:36,238 --> 02:12:41,678
definitely get back to thc at some point

3842
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:44,159
but i i just know i need a break exactly

3843
02:12:41,679 --> 02:12:45,760
exactly and and one again here's what

3844
02:12:44,158 --> 02:12:47,920
cam does specifically again

3845
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:49,119
why we're partnering together is he's

3846
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:52,639
been embracing

3847
02:12:49,118 --> 02:12:54,880
non-high thc strains

3848
02:12:52,639 --> 02:12:56,719
let me rephrase that he's been embracing

3849
02:12:54,880 --> 02:13:00,480
full spectrum

3850
02:12:56,719 --> 02:13:03,198
correct heritage craft balance strains

3851
02:13:00,479 --> 02:13:04,000
the way mother nature intended them to

3852
02:13:03,198 --> 02:13:07,439
be

3853
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:10,078
that's what i see where we create this

3854
02:13:07,439 --> 02:13:12,559
market or this niche or this veterans

3855
02:13:10,078 --> 02:13:14,799
community awareness that we have of

3856
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:16,719
this is how we approach this with our

3857
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:18,960
with our fellow brothers and sisters in

3858
02:13:16,719 --> 02:13:20,960
arms man this like you know we don't

3859
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:23,039
care if you want to sit on the couch and

3860
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:24,560
rip bong hits all afternoon and not get

3861
02:13:23,039 --> 02:13:26,000
off the couch that's your prerogative

3862
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:28,000
but we're going to show you how to do

3863
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,679
this conservatively and correctly the

3864
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,560
first time until you get your feet on

3865
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:32,880
the ground

3866
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:33,920
it's like anything you do the first time

3867
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:36,239
you know it's like

3868
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:37,440
you reference tequila i'm not a tequila

3869
02:13:36,238 --> 02:13:39,439
guy but i know there's a

3870
02:13:37,439 --> 02:13:41,598
full thing of that kind of a run you

3871
02:13:39,439 --> 02:13:41,598
know

3872
02:13:42,158 --> 02:13:46,158
you know it's like and as colin is

3873
02:13:44,479 --> 02:13:48,479
reaching out into now like

3874
02:13:46,158 --> 02:13:49,519
psilocybin and and other things that are

3875
02:13:48,479 --> 02:13:51,359
out there you know like

3876
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:53,360
freaking peyote which is one of my

3877
02:13:51,359 --> 02:13:56,158
personal favorites you know it's like

3878
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:58,559
and i did do a lot of mushrooms and eat

3879
02:13:56,158 --> 02:13:59,920
a lot of lsd back in the late 70s and

3880
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:01,760
early 80s when

3881
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:03,359
you know trying to process oh i didn't

3882
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:04,800
get that you know i didn't get

3883
02:14:03,359 --> 02:14:06,799
that that's what we were doing that we

3884
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:08,400
were decompressing back then when i was

3885
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:10,000
a young man in my 20s you know i didn't

3886
02:14:08,399 --> 02:14:11,519
get that that's what we were doing that

3887
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,840
we were trying to

3888
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:15,440
cast off all his calling reference cast

3889
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:17,520
off all this shit we just got finished

3890
02:14:15,439 --> 02:14:19,279
done in the previous 72 hours to get

3891
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:21,119
that fucking off of us you know

3892
02:14:19,279 --> 02:14:22,880
and it doesn't get off of you at all you

3893
02:14:21,118 --> 02:14:25,679
know it follows you through your life

3894
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:27,599
how we process it now what i'm realizing

3895
02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:30,000
of i thought my self-isolation was my

3896
02:14:27,599 --> 02:14:30,880
sanity i believe the plant is my sanity

3897
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,639
now

3898
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:35,199
and teaching people that you don't have

3899
02:14:32,639 --> 02:14:37,760
to self-isolate that you can

3900
02:14:35,198 --> 02:14:39,198
grasp this plant and it can be a

3901
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:41,840
lifeline to you

3902
02:14:39,198 --> 02:14:42,238
maybe it's not maybe it's not but at

3903
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:45,679
least

3904
02:14:42,238 --> 02:14:48,718
venture out beyond opioids and alcohol

3905
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:50,399
and self-seclusion and embrace veterans

3906
02:14:48,719 --> 02:14:51,198
walk and talk and get around other

3907
02:14:50,399 --> 02:14:53,039
brothers and

3908
02:14:51,198 --> 02:14:54,719
it did this old man that hadn't been

3909
02:14:53,039 --> 02:14:56,880
around other brothers and sisters in

3910
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:58,158

uh topic and it's kind of you know there

3945
02:16:04,238 --> 02:16:09,279
there's so much

3946
02:16:05,679 --> 02:16:10,719
division in society right now and people

3947
02:16:09,279 --> 02:16:13,840
who get

3948
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:16,960
really upset about certain things and i

3949
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:18,159
i kind of i want to point out some

3950
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:21,920
commonalities

3951
02:16:18,158 --> 02:16:24,399
and kind of bridging communities and

3952
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:27,520
you know doc you said i'm going to bring

3953
02:16:24,399 --> 02:16:27,519
up two docs

3954
02:16:27,599 --> 02:16:31,840
doc ray who earlier in this conversation

3955
02:16:30,319 --> 02:16:32,638
talked about when you kind of realize

3956
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:35,439
that

3957
02:16:32,638 --> 02:16:38,318
you know the military and the country

3958
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:41,359
doesn't care about you who served it

3959
02:16:38,318 --> 02:16:42,159
and doc rivers who said a couple days

3960
02:16:41,359 --> 02:16:44,000
ago

3961
02:16:42,159 --> 02:16:46,959
you know we keep loving this country and

3962
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:50,079
this country doesn't love us back

3963
02:16:46,959 --> 02:16:50,879
there's huge commonality there and i

3964
02:16:50,079 --> 02:16:53,200
think

3965
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:54,799
people who get upset about you know

3966
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:56,479
black lives matter and say

3967
02:16:54,799 --> 02:16:58,000
all lives matter i think any black

3968
02:16:56,478 --> 02:16:59,679
person would say of course

3969
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,599
we just hope you realize our lives

3970
02:16:59,679 --> 02:17:04,000
matter as much

3971
02:17:01,599 --> 02:17:05,679
not even more than but as much as

3972
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,200
everybody else is that seems like a

3973
02:17:05,679 --> 02:17:10,159
simple ask

3974
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:11,120
um and just the concept of fairness and

3975
02:17:10,159 --> 02:17:13,599
society

3976
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:15,120
and you know you're all military

3977
02:17:13,599 --> 02:17:18,558
veterans

3978
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:21,840
do any of you get offended when

3979
02:17:18,558 --> 02:17:25,438
a pro football player takes a knee

3980
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:28,760
at a stadium to try to raise awareness

3981
02:17:25,439 --> 02:17:32,159
for um just kind of

3982
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:35,920
unfairness and society as a slap in the

3983
02:17:32,159 --> 02:17:35,920
face to military veterans like you

3984
02:17:36,239 --> 02:17:39,920
don't know joanne i want to hear from

3985
02:17:38,638 --> 02:17:43,199
joanne on this one

3986
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:46,719
go ahead i mean from a veteran

3987
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:50,240
uh u.s military veteran perspective

3988
02:17:46,718 --> 02:17:52,638
no because that is the reason why

3989
02:17:50,239 --> 02:17:54,079
we serve colin and i were talking about

3990
02:17:52,638 --> 02:17:57,518
it yesterday

3991
02:17:54,079 --> 02:18:00,239
we cannot go up to

3992
02:17:57,519 --> 02:18:02,800
foreign lands claiming that we are

3993
02:18:00,239 --> 02:18:05,359
fighting for the freedom of our people

3994
02:18:02,799 --> 02:18:06,159
and come back here and deny the freedom

3995
02:18:05,359 --> 02:18:09,679
that is

3996
02:18:06,159 --> 02:18:12,879
ridiculous obviously

3997
02:18:09,679 --> 02:18:13,760
freedom of speech freedom of of of being

3998
02:18:12,879 --> 02:18:16,879
a person

3999
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:19,200
um having your own beliefs we claim that

4000
02:18:16,879 --> 02:18:23,119
we accept everyone here for their

4001
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:26,319
values obviously we don't when we

4002
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:29,519
uh think that number one i i

4003
02:18:26,318 --> 02:18:32,718
i'm sick and tired of people using

4004
02:18:29,519 --> 02:18:35,760
veterans as a pawn to

4005
02:18:32,718 --> 02:18:36,558
justify their beliefs or whatever they

4006
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:39,599
think

4007
02:18:36,558 --> 02:18:40,718
number one we are just a diversified

4008
02:18:39,599 --> 02:18:43,519
group of people

4009
02:18:40,718 --> 02:18:45,358
and have different opinions and some may

4010
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:46,478
agree with that and some may disagree

4011
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:50,239
with that so you can

4012
02:18:46,478 --> 02:18:53,119
just lump us all in one

4013
02:18:50,239 --> 02:18:53,840
uh group because it it doesn't work like

4014
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:57,120
that

4015
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:59,040
um yes we do join the military we have

4016
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:02,399
that in common and we

4017
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:05,840
fight alongside each other despite

4018
02:19:02,398 --> 02:19:09,119
our differences despite our mindset

4019
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:10,079
despite what we look like and make shit

4020
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:13,519
happen

4021
02:19:10,079 --> 02:19:14,638
um do good things do bad things whatever

4022
02:19:13,519 --> 02:19:18,000
the case may be

4023
02:19:14,638 --> 02:19:20,000
but in there um we're all doing that

4024
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,439
and even in the military you know there

4025
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:23,679
are people that are racist

4026
02:19:21,439 --> 02:19:25,840
and still have to work alongside a black

4027
02:19:23,679 --> 02:19:29,439
person and get the job done

4028
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:30,318
um and you know same situation um but

4029
02:19:29,439 --> 02:19:32,840
ultimately

4030
02:19:30,318 --> 02:19:34,000
no i'm not offended i think that is

4031
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:37,200
exactly

4032
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:40,478
why i went to war twice you know that

4033
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:42,800
for people to be able to do that here so

4034
02:19:40,478 --> 02:19:43,599
no to answer the question it does not

4035
02:19:42,799 --> 02:19:46,799
offend me

4036
02:19:43,599 --> 02:19:49,600
i think it's the way it should be

4037
02:19:46,799 --> 02:19:50,318
so you know they're not it's somebody

4038
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:53,600
that's not

4039
02:19:50,318 --> 02:19:57,279
breaking a law or um hurting

4040
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:58,960
anybody um but actually standing up for

4041
02:19:57,280 --> 02:19:59,600
something they believe and something

4042
02:19:58,959 --> 02:20:01,519
that

4043
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:03,359
does need to be addressed obviously look

4044
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:07,040
at the circumstances we're in

4045
02:20:03,359 --> 02:20:10,159
so if that wasn't predicting that hey

4046
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:11,760
putting a shedding light on a situation

4047
02:20:10,159 --> 02:20:13,680
in america that

4048
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:15,200
it's you know it's about time we get

4049
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:18,239
over that hump

4050
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:20,240
um clearly so not at all

4051
02:20:18,239 --> 02:20:22,398
i think it was necessary and i think

4052
02:20:20,239 --> 02:20:24,000
it's still necessary for people to stand

4053
02:20:22,398 --> 02:20:26,318
up for what they believe in

4054
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,359
or what or you know for stuff that's

4055
02:20:26,318 --> 02:20:31,680
violating

4056
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:35,120
uh human right rights in america so no

4057
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:38,318
not offending i'm proud as hell so i

4058
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:41,120
i want to hear from the three white

4059
02:20:38,318 --> 02:20:43,279
males in this conversation who all

4060
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:48,000
served our country

4061
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:50,479
your thoughts on someone taking a knee

4062
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,280
to try to raise awareness for social

4063
02:20:50,478 --> 02:20:55,199
justice

4064
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:55,600
are you offended because people watching

4065
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:57,909
this

4066
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:59,439
are white males who

4067
02:20:57,909 --> 02:21:02,239
[Music]

4068
02:20:59,439 --> 02:21:03,439
think it's horrific and and not

4069
02:21:02,239 --> 02:21:06,719
patriotic

4070
02:21:03,439 --> 02:21:07,439
so talk to those people i mean i'm i'm

4071
02:21:06,719 --> 02:21:10,398
happy to

4072
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:11,040
talk about this i am not offended i

4073
02:21:10,398 --> 02:21:14,239
think that

4074
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:15,120
it is uh thank you for unmuting my mic i

4075
02:21:14,239 --> 02:21:18,478
think that is

4076
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:20,479
um heroic i think that it is something

4077
02:21:18,478 --> 02:21:22,719
to be revered in this country when you

4078
02:21:20,478 --> 02:21:25,199
stand up to something that is wrong

4079
02:21:22,719 --> 02:21:27,599
that should be celebrated um i am

4080
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:30,479
reading a book right now that has got my

4081
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:31,040
uh absolute mind it's called how fascism

4082
02:21:30,478 --> 02:21:33,199
works

4083
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:34,640
and i can't recommend it enough it is

4084
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:37,040
very informative

4085
02:21:34,639 --> 02:21:39,279
and what this lays out and what has

4086
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:42,319
happened throughout history

4087
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:44,000
is this mythic past of patriotism that

4088
02:21:42,318 --> 02:21:45,760
everyone holds on to and this

4089
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,639
patriarchal

4090
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:49,600
society that everything is war is good

4091
02:21:48,639 --> 02:21:51,680
if you go to war

4092
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:53,840
be proud about it no matter what you did

4093
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:55,680
no matter if you did bad things don't

4094
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:56,559
talk about those things only talk about

4095
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:58,479
the good things

4096
02:21:56,559 --> 02:22:00,799
your your beautiful wife at home should

4097
02:21:58,478 --> 02:22:01,920
be proud to be making kids and be taking

4098
02:22:00,799 --> 02:22:03,679
care of those kids

4099
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:05,200
while you're off fighting this war that

4100
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:07,600
nobody seriously

4101
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:09,200
really even understands and what it goes

4102
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:12,318
back to for me

4103
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:14,079
is admitting mistakes because it's it's

4104
02:22:12,318 --> 02:22:17,119
okay to make mistakes it's not

4105
02:22:14,079 --> 02:22:19,520
that's what life is to to be

4106
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:20,319
to be human is to air to air is to be

4107
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:24,479
human right

4108
02:22:20,318 --> 02:22:26,478
shakespeare so um you

4109
02:22:24,478 --> 02:22:28,159
making mistakes is okay but admitting

4110
02:22:26,478 --> 02:22:30,239
them

4111
02:22:28,159 --> 02:22:32,239
is just where we get off and we won't

4112
02:22:30,239 --> 02:22:34,639
admit our mistakes and so we built up

4113
02:22:32,239 --> 02:22:38,318
this mythic past of america

4114
02:22:34,639 --> 02:22:40,079
as being this great land of opportunity

4115
02:22:38,318 --> 02:22:41,840
the heartland the heartland the

4116
02:22:40,079 --> 02:22:43,920
heartland the the

4117
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:45,359
the people that feed us the farmers the

4118
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:47,120
people they should be revered

4119
02:22:45,359 --> 02:22:49,200
their opinions everything it should be

4120
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:52,160
preserved pride should be preserved

4121
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:53,359
that is all systematic racism and if you

4122
02:22:52,159 --> 02:22:55,600
don't admit that you are

4123
02:22:53,359 --> 02:22:56,880
fooling yourself the fact of the matter

4124
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:58,880
is

4125
02:22:56,879 --> 02:23:01,358
people like colin kaepernick taking a

4126
02:22:58,879 --> 02:23:04,318
knee takes more bravery

4127
02:23:01,359 --> 02:23:05,040
than a lot of people understand that is

4128
02:23:04,318 --> 02:23:08,000
not easy

4129
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:09,520
it is it is it is almost impossible in

4130
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:12,398
this day and age and look at the

4131
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:13,120
look at what it's caused i it's one man

4132
02:23:12,398 --> 02:23:15,119
one man

4133
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:16,800
and look at what it's caused for good or

4134
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:18,640
bad people are still talking about it

4135
02:23:16,799 --> 02:23:22,318
and that's what's important

4136
02:23:18,639 --> 02:23:25,039
for me i see

4137
02:23:22,318 --> 02:23:26,478
i you cannot get you can't i can't have

4138
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:28,240
a conversation with people

4139
02:23:26,478 --> 02:23:30,000
who start off by saying this this

4140
02:23:28,239 --> 02:23:31,840
country isn't racist this country was

4141
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:34,000
built on racism this country sends

4142
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:36,159
people to war based on racism

4143
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,239
all i i can't speak for everybody here

4144
02:23:36,159 --> 02:23:40,159
but for me i came to the army at my

4145
02:23:38,239 --> 02:23:42,159
absolute lowest point i had no other

4146
02:23:40,159 --> 02:23:45,280
alternative that's such a common

4147
02:23:42,159 --> 02:23:46,398
story why is that the case why are why

4148
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:49,200
are our most

4149
02:23:46,398 --> 02:23:50,799
downtrodden and hurt people why are the

4150
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:53,280
people who are impoverished in this

4151
02:23:50,799 --> 02:23:54,959
country the ones serving it the most

4152
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:56,640
these are all things that need to change

4153
02:23:54,959 --> 02:24:00,559
and until we admit it

4154
02:23:56,639 --> 02:24:02,719
it won't so absolutely i don't

4155
02:24:00,559 --> 02:24:04,478
right now i i'm having a baby in

4156
02:24:02,719 --> 02:24:05,920
november or i would be on every front

4157
02:24:04,478 --> 02:24:08,559
line of these protests

4158
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:10,398
every single one and i i i can't

4159
02:24:08,559 --> 02:24:11,359
everybody out there protesting don't

4160
02:24:10,398 --> 02:24:14,000
stop

4161
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:15,760
well you have been though so we've been

4162
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:17,760
approaching that's true yeah

4163
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:19,439
that's true we have and i wouldn't i'd

4164
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:20,239
be there out there every i wanna i mean

4165
02:24:19,439 --> 02:24:23,200
like i

4166
02:24:20,239 --> 02:24:24,559
i feel this call to action now but it's

4167
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:26,159
almost too like it's

4168
02:24:24,559 --> 02:24:28,159
too great like it's like i want

4169
02:24:26,159 --> 02:24:29,280
something to put my hands on i'm just

4170
02:24:28,159 --> 02:24:32,000
like i can

4171
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:33,520
get and grasp you know like if racism

4172
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:35,359
was right in front of me i could just

4173
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:37,120
choke it until it was gone but

4174
02:24:35,359 --> 02:24:38,800
it doesn't work like that which is why

4175
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:41,920
these books are

4176
02:24:38,799 --> 02:24:42,879
you don't understand like the level of

4177
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:45,760
effort

4178
02:24:42,879 --> 02:24:48,000
that goes into dividing us it is crazy

4179
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:51,439
and cannabis

4180
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:52,000
is the great unifier and put it back

4181
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:53,439
around it

4182
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:57,840
brought it back around to that shirt i

4183
02:24:53,439 --> 02:24:57,840
love that

4184
02:24:58,879 --> 02:25:02,799
and what i think people don't realize is

4185
02:25:00,478 --> 02:25:05,199
this isn't about taking away from

4186
02:25:02,799 --> 02:25:06,000
somebody or a group or a class of people

4187
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:08,479
this is about

4188
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,000
raising everybody up this is about

4189
02:25:08,478 --> 02:25:12,318
looking all of our brothers and sisters

4190
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:13,120
in the eye and having that contact and

4191
02:25:12,318 --> 02:25:14,559
that love

4192
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:17,040
and if you listen to the people that are

4193
02:25:14,559 --> 02:25:17,760
spewing the hate they're angry at people

4194
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:20,640
who they've

4195
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:22,478
never met on the word of somebody that

4196
02:25:20,639 --> 02:25:25,439
is a known liar or

4197
02:25:22,478 --> 02:25:27,279
is out there to mr misrepresent i've

4198
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:28,559
been very blessed to be able to travel

4199
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:31,520
all over the world

4200
02:25:28,559 --> 02:25:32,879
and every place i've been i haven't been

4201
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:35,520
to shithole countries

4202
02:25:32,879 --> 02:25:36,398
i've met beautiful people everywhere

4203
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:39,359
i've been

4204
02:25:36,398 --> 02:25:41,199
and i can't tell you how i think i think

4205
02:25:39,359 --> 02:25:43,280
travel will solve a lot of that

4206
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:46,240
but the powers that be are trying to

4207
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:48,079
divide us so we don't unite

4208
02:25:46,239 --> 02:25:50,239
and we just need to look at each other

4209
02:25:48,079 --> 02:25:52,000
and and listen

4210
02:25:50,239 --> 02:25:54,239
this is my time right now to listen to

4211
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:56,159
people and hear what's happening and see

4212
02:25:54,239 --> 02:25:58,239
is i'm at that weird transition where i

4213
02:25:56,159 --> 02:26:00,398
still think i'm 18 but yeah i think i'm

4214
02:25:58,239 --> 02:26:02,239
about to get an aarp letter

4215
02:26:00,398 --> 02:26:04,079
but everybody keeps talking about our

4216
02:26:02,239 --> 02:26:04,799
kids how they're lazy they're shiftless

4217
02:26:04,079 --> 02:26:07,920
they just do

4218
02:26:04,799 --> 02:26:08,719
play video games no we need to listen to

4219
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:10,478
them we need to be

4220
02:26:08,719 --> 02:26:12,159
mentors we need to support them we need

4221
02:26:10,478 --> 02:26:12,799
to show them that there's more community

4222
02:26:12,159 --> 02:26:15,039
than

4223
02:26:12,799 --> 02:26:16,478
anger and vitriol we need to show the

4224
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:18,240
younger kids that

4225
02:26:16,478 --> 02:26:20,398
it's okay to listen and to love another

4226
02:26:18,239 --> 02:26:23,199
person that you disagree with

4227
02:26:20,398 --> 02:26:24,079
and i i'm hoping you need great trauma

4228
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:25,359
to heal

4229
02:26:24,079 --> 02:26:27,600
and i think we're going to have to rip

4230
02:26:25,359 --> 02:26:29,359
the band-aid off rip the scab off

4231
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:31,920
re-break the bone and let it heal

4232
02:26:29,359 --> 02:26:32,159
properly add a little cannabis bomb in

4233
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:36,000
it

4234
02:26:32,159 --> 02:26:38,159
it'll fix yeah this there you go

4235
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:39,439
well said and that's all about admitting

4236
02:26:38,159 --> 02:26:41,520
that we were wrong

4237
02:26:39,439 --> 02:26:43,040
let's just admit we were wrong about so

4238
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:45,040
many things i mean

4239
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:46,399
we we we're not even like we're talking

4240
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:47,439
about this joanne yesterday in our

4241
02:26:46,398 --> 02:26:50,398
podcast like

4242
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:52,639
growing up as a american man learning an

4243
02:26:50,398 --> 02:26:54,879
education system

4244
02:26:52,639 --> 02:26:55,680
schools where i was taught segregation

4245
02:26:54,879 --> 02:26:57,759
like not

4246
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:59,120
about it i was taught that it's how you

4247
02:26:57,760 --> 02:27:01,680
should live

4248
02:26:59,120 --> 02:27:02,160
cliques are a word for segregation you

4249
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:04,079
know you're

4250
02:27:02,159 --> 02:27:05,680
these things are taught to us in our

4251
02:27:04,079 --> 02:27:06,879
institutions that we're supposed to

4252
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:10,079
trust

4253
02:27:06,879 --> 02:27:11,039
there's so many america is a beautiful

4254
02:27:10,079 --> 02:27:14,079
beautiful country

4255
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:15,280
it it has potential it's also was the

4256
02:27:14,079 --> 02:27:17,439
first of its kind in

4257
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:19,120
many ways and an experiment that is just

4258
02:27:17,439 --> 02:27:21,840
over 200 years old

4259
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:23,520
so it's okay to admit we made mistakes

4260
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:25,840
we're that young i mean

4261
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:26,800
we barely know what we're doing can we

4262
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:29,040
just admit that

4263
02:27:26,799 --> 02:27:31,519
and then move forward like you said let

4264
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:34,240
it scab over put some cbd bomb on it and

4265
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:34,239
move forward

4266
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:40,800
period period

4267
02:27:38,270 --> 02:27:44,319
[Laughter]

4268
02:27:40,799 --> 02:27:46,478
so the for me the the contrast

4269
02:27:44,318 --> 02:27:47,600
is and that that for me was really

4270
02:27:46,478 --> 02:27:50,398
important because i

4271
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:50,399
i you know

4272
02:27:50,639 --> 02:27:54,000
there are a lot of impressionable people

4273
02:27:52,719 --> 02:27:56,959
who watch this

4274
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:58,000
and i want them to hear from real

4275
02:27:56,959 --> 02:28:01,279
veterans that

4276
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:03,920
you're not offended uh and and

4277
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:05,680
they the people who are offended didn't

4278
02:28:03,920 --> 02:28:08,799
serve in the military so i'm like

4279
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:11,359
well that's the truth in the military

4280
02:28:08,799 --> 02:28:11,920
that is the point i wanted nobody this

4281
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:14,159
up

4282
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:15,840
well that's what i said about the people

4283
02:28:14,159 --> 02:28:19,520
that use the military

4284
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:22,000
as a pond like us to mask

4285
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:23,680
their agenda and lumping us all in one

4286
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:27,840
category as if

4287
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:27,840
we all think collectively as one thing

4288
02:28:28,398 --> 02:28:35,840
so for me the most egregious thing

4289
02:28:32,639 --> 02:28:38,959
was discovering that the nfl

4290
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:41,840
had their you know pay-to-play

4291
02:28:38,959 --> 02:28:43,759
patriotism where they were collecting

4292
02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:46,639
money from the armed services

4293
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:47,280
for all the dramatic uh you know

4294
02:28:46,639 --> 02:28:50,279
national

4295
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:52,079
anthem like military jets flying

4296
02:28:50,280 --> 02:28:55,120
overhead

4297
02:28:52,079 --> 02:28:58,318
uh that makes you want to throw up

4298
02:28:55,120 --> 02:29:01,840
the nfl the atlanta falcons yep

4299
02:28:58,318 --> 02:29:04,079
go ahead and so

4300
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:09,439
so it's interesting to see what people

4301
02:29:04,079 --> 02:29:11,359
get upset about and then

4302
02:29:09,439 --> 02:29:13,600
you said it though peter you said but

4303
02:29:11,359 --> 02:29:16,079
you said again in in colin you alluded

4304
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:17,600
to it too is that false patriotism the

4305
02:29:16,079 --> 02:29:18,159
ones that are the ones that are upset

4306
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:20,960
there are

4307
02:29:18,159 --> 02:29:22,079
veterans you know again generationally

4308
02:29:20,959 --> 02:29:24,478
because i'm hearing it from you

4309
02:29:22,079 --> 02:29:25,840
guys generation of me ben i give a damn

4310
02:29:24,478 --> 02:29:28,318
what color you were

4311
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:29,120
okay quite honestly my teammate was

4312
02:29:28,318 --> 02:29:32,079
black

4313
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:34,160
i love him so much you know we we we're

4314
02:29:32,079 --> 02:29:34,959
partners you know we were intertwined at

4315
02:29:34,159 --> 02:29:37,680
the hips man

4316
02:29:34,959 --> 02:29:39,119
that we depended on each other you know

4317
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:41,200
and i don't care man

4318
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:43,200
it's just the bottom line of it you know

4319
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:44,720
it's like and it breaks my heart because

4320
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:47,520
i raise my children just

4321
02:29:44,719 --> 02:29:49,358
to be color blind also and it just

4322
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:50,960
really breaks my freaking heart

4323
02:29:49,359 --> 02:29:52,399
because i personally had thought this

4324
02:29:50,959 --> 02:29:53,759
was something we had worked through and

4325
02:29:52,398 --> 02:29:54,639
what i realized is we haven't worked

4326
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:57,680
through shit

4327
02:29:54,639 --> 02:29:59,840
in over a half a century and i grew up

4328
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:00,318
in that time period in the 60s and saw

4329
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:02,398
this

4330
02:30:00,318 --> 02:30:03,840
saw a lot of this turmoil and unrest and

4331
02:30:02,398 --> 02:30:05,840
it and the thing that

4332
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:07,600
kills me and i'm sick and tired of it

4333
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:10,719
and maybe as a veteran community

4334
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:12,479
we address it these posers man

4335
02:30:10,719 --> 02:30:15,199
these things that show up with their

4336
02:30:12,478 --> 02:30:17,199
indignants with their flags and their

4337
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:18,880
body armor and all their crap trying to

4338
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:21,040
say that they represent us and they

4339
02:30:18,879 --> 02:30:23,679
don't represent us you know how do we

4340
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:25,280
come in and play a part in this thing

4341
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:26,398
you know i'm not sure how to address

4342
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:28,880
that one peter

4343
02:30:26,398 --> 02:30:29,439
but i do know this part of it there is

4344
02:30:28,879 --> 02:30:32,478
that

4345
02:30:29,439 --> 02:30:35,200
that part of it that i just it's like

4346
02:30:32,478 --> 02:30:35,760
i don't see it cam's saying he doesn't

4347
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:37,600
see it

4348
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:39,040
colin's saying he doesn't see it john

4349
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:40,159
said she doesn't see it we're

4350
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:43,280
generationally

4351
02:30:40,159 --> 02:30:44,559
we're talking 44 decades of freaking

4352
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:46,960
military

4353
02:30:44,559 --> 02:30:48,719
covering it all and we as a community

4354
02:30:46,959 --> 02:30:50,000
don't necessarily embrace it i'm not

4355
02:30:48,719 --> 02:30:52,959
saying that there's not that

4356
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:54,318
fringe that does see it but we have

4357
02:30:52,959 --> 02:30:56,478
worked integrated for

4358
02:30:54,318 --> 02:30:58,318
freaking decades and we as a team

4359
02:30:56,478 --> 02:31:00,159
approach things as a team

4360
02:30:58,318 --> 02:31:01,600
we don't see black and white we don't

4361
02:31:00,159 --> 02:31:04,719
see yellow and brown

4362
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:08,318
we see green or we see blue

4363
02:31:04,719 --> 02:31:10,079
or we see od and that's how we function

4364
02:31:08,318 --> 02:31:12,000
and we all depended on each other to

4365
02:31:10,079 --> 02:31:13,520
keep each other alive

4366
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:15,359
so when they come out this false

4367
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:17,600
patriotism thing at the

4368
02:31:15,359 --> 02:31:19,520
football football games and all that

4369
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:20,720
nonsense it's like it's just a bunch of

4370
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:23,600
nonsense man

4371
02:31:20,719 --> 02:31:25,438
and i don't know you you helping voice

4372
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:26,880
the veteran community to us getting out

4373
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:27,280
is like the true ones of us that have

4374
02:31:26,879 --> 02:31:29,358
paid

4375
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:31,280
sign the blank check the ones that has

4376
02:31:29,359 --> 02:31:33,600
really signed that piece of paper

4377
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:36,399
and did the time we're not the ones that

4378
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:38,239
are up in arms about this thing man

4379
02:31:36,398 --> 02:31:40,239
it's it's ones that aren't really part

4380
02:31:38,239 --> 02:31:41,760
of it it's one that aren't part of our

4381
02:31:40,239 --> 02:31:45,119
veteran community the

4382
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:46,478
the distractors the naysayers whatever

4383
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:48,800
you want to call a man

4384
02:31:46,478 --> 02:31:50,239
the the instigators whoever they are

4385
02:31:48,799 --> 02:31:51,599
they think they're trying their personal

4386
02:31:50,239 --> 02:31:55,280
gain on something that

4387
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:57,520
isn't and joanne says you know trying to

4388
02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:59,520
get what they want off of our blood

4389
02:31:57,520 --> 02:31:59,760
sweat and tears and our backs man it's

4390
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:01,120
like

4391
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:03,120
that's part i don't think we as a

4392
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:04,800
community well again we as a community

4393
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:06,399
don't get addressed 99

4394
02:32:04,799 --> 02:32:08,000
of the time why because only three

4395
02:32:06,398 --> 02:32:08,478
percent of us on the whole freaking

4396
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,719
country

4397
02:32:08,478 --> 02:32:12,398
ever served this country and then it's

4398
02:32:10,719 --> 02:32:14,159
even more integrated when you get into

4399
02:32:12,398 --> 02:32:14,559
families that are military families like

4400
02:32:14,159 --> 02:32:17,039
me

4401
02:32:14,559 --> 02:32:18,639
i have four grown children and all four

4402
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:22,160
of them have served

4403
02:32:18,639 --> 02:32:22,879
okay i have three that are active right

4404
02:32:22,159 --> 02:32:25,119
now

4405
02:32:22,879 --> 02:32:27,279
okay this is part of again we are a

4406
02:32:25,120 --> 02:32:29,840
military community i have a baby brother

4407
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:30,640
that is a marine corps my old man was in

4408
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:33,920
the air force

4409
02:32:30,639 --> 02:32:36,639
we are a military family okay

4410
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:38,239
that sways that three percent by a lot

4411
02:32:36,639 --> 02:32:40,398
when it's one or two families where

4412
02:32:38,239 --> 02:32:42,398
their whole family served

4413
02:32:40,398 --> 02:32:46,159
you know and as we see we've seen

4414
02:32:42,398 --> 02:32:46,159
generationally since vietnam

4415
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:52,398
people that come from underprivileged

4416
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:54,800
backgrounds find it as a way out

4417
02:32:52,398 --> 02:32:56,879
to get out and get where they want to go

4418
02:32:54,799 --> 02:32:59,679
that don't have

4419
02:32:56,879 --> 02:33:01,438
a slot at an ivy league college you know

4420
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:03,840
as a military family we

4421
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:04,479
we we worked poor we worked hard you

4422
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:06,960
know

4423
02:33:04,478 --> 02:33:08,799
what no silver spoons here that whole

4424
02:33:06,959 --> 02:33:11,279
thing it's like we this is that

4425
02:33:08,799 --> 02:33:11,840
the military was a way to get away from

4426
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:13,280
it

4427
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:15,040
you know get you to where you wanted to

4428
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:18,079
go what happened with me

4429
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:19,439
generationally i shifted i instilled in

4430
02:33:18,079 --> 02:33:20,079
my kids because i knew they were going

4431
02:33:19,439 --> 02:33:21,680
to do it

4432
02:33:20,079 --> 02:33:23,439
instilled in them to get what they

4433
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:25,760
wanted out of it they've also

4434
02:33:23,439 --> 02:33:27,359
selected career careers within the

4435
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:28,239
branches that they thought would best

4436
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:31,520
serve them

4437
02:33:28,239 --> 02:33:32,799
after the fact okay and i'm off topic on

4438
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:35,280
this thing but to

4439
02:33:32,799 --> 02:33:37,358
assume that we as a veteran community

4440
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:40,079
get offended because someone takes a

4441
02:33:37,359 --> 02:33:43,920
a knee during a sporting's event for

4442
02:33:40,079 --> 02:33:43,920
crying out loud it's a freaking game

4443
02:33:44,639 --> 02:33:50,879
that that's what i've always laughed at

4444
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:54,720
is how did sports events become

4445
02:33:50,879 --> 02:33:56,799
these patriotic uh you know like

4446
02:33:54,719 --> 02:33:58,559
national anthem at the beginning of

4447
02:33:56,799 --> 02:34:01,759
every professional

4448
02:33:58,559 --> 02:34:03,199
and college sports game it's because the

4449
02:34:01,760 --> 02:34:04,478
department of defense has an

4450
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:06,640
entertainment budget

4451
02:34:04,478 --> 02:34:08,559
period as long as the department of

4452
02:34:06,639 --> 02:34:10,000
defense has an entertainment budget and

4453
02:34:08,559 --> 02:34:11,279
a recruiting budget

4454
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:13,439
there you're going to get false

4455
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:14,960
patriotism that the the fact of the

4456
02:34:13,439 --> 02:34:17,280
matter is the department of defense pays

4457
02:34:14,959 --> 02:34:19,519
the nfl in order to put flags out and

4458
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:20,239
put guys who look revered and and do all

4459
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:22,239
that stuff

4460
02:34:20,239 --> 02:34:24,239
so that their recruiting numbers in this

4461
02:34:22,239 --> 02:34:27,920
in the worst parts of our country

4462
02:34:24,239 --> 02:34:30,239
will be beefed up because football and

4463
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:31,840
people of color and all these things are

4464
02:34:30,239 --> 02:34:33,600
severely affected by

4465
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:35,040
so much of the poverty and so much of

4466
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:38,079
the systematic racism

4467
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:40,560
at the top of our country right now

4468
02:34:38,079 --> 02:34:42,079
whether or not you want to put out

4469
02:34:40,559 --> 02:34:45,519
everything else that that

4470
02:34:42,079 --> 02:34:48,079
that man as our president has done

4471
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:49,120
that man wouldn't last two seconds on a

4472
02:34:48,079 --> 02:34:52,639
line

4473
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:54,800
two seconds now for me that means a lot

4474
02:34:52,639 --> 02:34:56,398
what put that man on an aircraft carrier

4475
02:34:54,799 --> 02:34:57,438
and watch him watch what happens if he's

4476
02:34:56,398 --> 02:34:59,439
blown by a fucking

4477
02:34:57,439 --> 02:35:01,280
aircraft jet see what happens to that

4478
02:34:59,439 --> 02:35:04,800
man i'm pretty sure he's not going to

4479
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:06,319
get back and go to work like i did

4480
02:35:04,799 --> 02:35:08,159
and he's and he's going to be milking

4481
02:35:06,318 --> 02:35:11,359
that forever and

4482
02:35:08,159 --> 02:35:16,000
here's the thing with that is like

4483
02:35:11,359 --> 02:35:19,439
i joined the infantry in 2007

4484
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:23,120
late 2007-2008 i

4485
02:35:19,439 --> 02:35:24,800
had to go through rigorous psychological

4486
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:27,760
and psychiatric

4487
02:35:24,799 --> 02:35:30,000
psychiatric testing before i was able to

4488
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:33,280
join i had to take an iq score

4489
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:35,200
i had to take the asvab i had to

4490
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:37,040
because i admitted to using cannabis i

4491
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:38,800
joined the military at 26 years old

4492
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:40,560
because i admitted to using cannabis

4493
02:35:38,799 --> 02:35:41,199
more than 50 times before prior to

4494
02:35:40,559 --> 02:35:44,398
joining

4495
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:46,159
i was made to see a psychiatrist

4496
02:35:44,398 --> 02:35:47,840
these are all things i had to go through

4497
02:35:46,159 --> 02:35:50,959
in order to go to war

4498
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:54,159
and be in a lethal instrument

4499
02:35:50,959 --> 02:35:57,438
of this country why is it that

4500
02:35:54,159 --> 02:35:58,239
anyone with the money to put their name

4501
02:35:57,439 --> 02:36:01,439
out there

4502
02:35:58,239 --> 02:36:04,959
can climb to the very top of that pillar

4503
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:08,239
and be in charge of everyone that is

4504
02:36:04,959 --> 02:36:11,759
so backwards and

4505
02:36:08,239 --> 02:36:14,079
wrong in so many ways again

4506
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:16,079
we just have to come to an understanding

4507
02:36:14,079 --> 02:36:16,639
that some things we've tried have not

4508
02:36:16,079 --> 02:36:20,159
worked

4509
02:36:16,639 --> 02:36:21,920
and i think we will grow from them

4510
02:36:20,159 --> 02:36:23,760
hopefully so hopefully we'll see that

4511
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:25,439
and i and i'm not speaking for everybody

4512
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:26,800
but i hope that we see a

4513
02:36:25,439 --> 02:36:29,200
shift that we haven't seen quite

4514
02:36:26,799 --> 02:36:30,639
honestly i'm i'm going to go back a

4515
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:32,000
little bit for some of you guys when

4516
02:36:30,639 --> 02:36:34,159
clarence thomas was

4517
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:36,079
going on to the supreme court and anita

4518
02:36:34,159 --> 02:36:39,280
hill we've seen this

4519
02:36:36,079 --> 02:36:42,398
the swell of females and

4520
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:45,600
people of color and unrepresented

4521
02:36:42,398 --> 02:36:46,478
move into the political spectrum that

4522
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:49,439
wasn't there

4523
02:36:46,478 --> 02:36:51,358
previously it took you know then that

4524
02:36:49,439 --> 02:36:52,880
was 91 it's like that's how far

4525
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:54,479
back this goes since the last time we've

4526
02:36:52,879 --> 02:36:57,039
seen this kind of grassroots movements

4527
02:36:54,478 --> 02:36:59,358
within our politics and i'm so thankful

4528
02:36:57,040 --> 02:37:00,240
to see so many women coming quite

4529
02:36:59,359 --> 02:37:02,399
honestly

4530
02:37:00,239 --> 02:37:03,840
it pisses me off being a crotchety old

4531
02:37:02,398 --> 02:37:05,760
white guy to get looped in with all

4532
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:07,920
these other jackasses or crotchy old

4533
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:09,120
white guys because i am not one of those

4534
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:11,760
motherfuckers no

4535
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:14,000
i'll tell you something we are all aware

4536
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:16,639
that not everybody is like that

4537
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,398
um i i'm thankful for it sister because

4538
02:37:16,639 --> 02:37:20,879
i i don't

4539
02:37:18,398 --> 02:37:22,398
i'm thankful for that not everybody is

4540
02:37:20,879 --> 02:37:25,438
like that and quite frankly

4541
02:37:22,398 --> 02:37:28,719
even in the military where i

4542
02:37:25,439 --> 02:37:30,000
experience individuals who came from a

4543
02:37:28,719 --> 02:37:32,879
background where

4544
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:34,719
perhaps growing up the only perception

4545
02:37:32,879 --> 02:37:36,000
of a black person they had was what they

4546
02:37:34,719 --> 02:37:39,199
saw on tv

4547
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:40,159
um and then coming into contact and

4548
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:43,359
seeing like

4549
02:37:40,159 --> 02:37:43,920
whoa and admitting like i was completely

4550
02:37:43,359 --> 02:37:47,040
like i

4551
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:48,079
never thought um a black person would be

4552
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:51,600
able to do this

4553
02:37:48,079 --> 02:37:53,760
or act a certain way or um so

4554
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:55,439
even in that happened in the military

4555
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:58,239
and quite frankly

4556
02:37:55,439 --> 02:37:58,880
witnessing that gave me number one an

4557
02:37:58,239 --> 02:38:02,000
even more

4558
02:37:58,879 --> 02:38:05,839
greater understanding of the fabric of

4559
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:07,200
america and the limited exposure that

4560
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:10,719
people have

4561
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:13,439
um and at the same time people can come

4562
02:38:10,719 --> 02:38:14,719
to to their senses once you know coming

4563
02:38:13,439 --> 02:38:16,880
like you said

4564
02:38:14,719 --> 02:38:19,119
i think it was kim that said earlier

4565
02:38:16,879 --> 02:38:21,679
traveling just completely changes your

4566
02:38:19,120 --> 02:38:22,479
your perspective because exposure

4567
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:24,398
matters

4568
02:38:22,478 --> 02:38:27,519
um and also even on tv like

4569
02:38:24,398 --> 02:38:30,799
representation matter so if you

4570
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:34,000
have this race portrayed as a

4571
02:38:30,799 --> 02:38:36,239
way on tv and that's the only

4572
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:37,120
access that these people have to view in

4573
02:38:36,239 --> 02:38:40,239
that

4574
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:44,079
clearly it creates some systemic issues

4575
02:38:40,239 --> 02:38:46,398
um in the fabric of america and i think

4576
02:38:44,079 --> 02:38:47,280
the fact that all this stuff is arising

4577
02:38:46,398 --> 02:38:50,639
and

4578
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:52,560
we are all even no matter which spectrum

4579
02:38:50,639 --> 02:38:56,239
which side of the spectrum you

4580
02:38:52,559 --> 02:38:57,920
end up as far as your beliefs um we all

4581
02:38:56,239 --> 02:39:01,039
know there's a fucking problem

4582
02:38:57,920 --> 02:39:02,239
and i feel that we are all actively

4583
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:05,600
working towards

4584
02:39:02,239 --> 02:39:08,000
um making the necessary corrections

4585
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:10,079
um we don't know the there's a problem

4586
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,959
that was created like colin said we

4587
02:39:10,079 --> 02:39:14,000
can't put an

4588
02:39:10,959 --> 02:39:16,879
actual face to it so we can

4589
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:18,239
punch it but you know we just got to

4590
02:39:16,879 --> 02:39:20,079
continue to move forward

4591
02:39:18,239 --> 02:39:22,398
we have to continue to admit that

4592
02:39:20,079 --> 02:39:26,000
there's a problem awareness

4593
02:39:22,398 --> 02:39:27,519
and then what can we do personally how

4594
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:30,559
far can we reach

4595
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:32,239
to cause an impact and a change um

4596
02:39:30,559 --> 02:39:34,478
and the fact you know that we have these

4597
02:39:32,239 --> 02:39:36,000
conversations colin and i get together

4598
02:39:34,478 --> 02:39:38,719
weekly and have

4599
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:39,520
um discussions that we know are not

4600
02:39:38,719 --> 02:39:43,119
being had

4601
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:46,000
so if we have the eyes on ourselves

4602
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:46,720
we should go ahead and discuss them um

4603
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:49,359
and

4604
02:39:46,719 --> 02:39:50,398
right now because we are most of us are

4605
02:39:49,359 --> 02:39:53,920
just enclosed

4606
02:39:50,398 --> 02:39:54,159
not everybody we we're not so caught up

4607
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:57,120
in

4608
02:39:54,159 --> 02:39:59,119
in life um now we're home with this

4609
02:39:57,120 --> 02:40:03,520
whole kimono virus shit it has

4610
02:39:59,120 --> 02:40:05,359
literally um it's it's had us glued to

4611
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:06,560
a box for the most part whether it's

4612
02:40:05,359 --> 02:40:09,920
your small screen or

4613
02:40:06,559 --> 02:40:12,959
or the bigger one um and now

4614
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:13,600
we have we can't turn away so now you

4615
02:40:12,959 --> 02:40:15,599
know

4616
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:17,439
we all have to actually do something

4617
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:20,559
which honestly guys

4618
02:40:17,439 --> 02:40:21,920
um it excites me you know that the fact

4619
02:40:20,559 --> 02:40:24,398
like okay so now

4620
02:40:21,920 --> 02:40:26,239
you really don't got much going on what

4621
02:40:24,398 --> 02:40:29,439
are you gonna do to make the change

4622
02:40:26,239 --> 02:40:32,719
because now you know that something has

4623
02:40:29,439 --> 02:40:35,840
something has to change um and i'm super

4624
02:40:32,719 --> 02:40:38,159
proud of at least a circle around me

4625
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:39,680
and obviously by extension with you guys

4626
02:40:38,159 --> 02:40:42,959
that

4627
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:45,920
we are all towards elevating everybody

4628
02:40:42,959 --> 02:40:48,079
elevating you know we are aware that a

4629
02:40:45,920 --> 02:40:50,318
group of people black people we've not

4630
02:40:48,079 --> 02:40:51,600
been elevated by this country so it's

4631
02:40:50,318 --> 02:40:54,559
about time

4632
02:40:51,600 --> 02:40:57,439
that we equal the playing field and we

4633
02:40:54,559 --> 02:41:01,039
are human too and we've contributed

4634
02:40:57,439 --> 02:41:03,680
as a collective um to

4635
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:04,560
lot just as much if not you know

4636
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:07,920
speaking from

4637
02:41:04,559 --> 02:41:10,239
from my culture we've we've contributed

4638
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:11,120
more than enough to have a seat at the

4639
02:41:10,239 --> 02:41:14,959
table and that's

4640
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:17,600
a man sister honestly because

4641
02:41:14,959 --> 02:41:18,719
cannabis bringing it full circle joanne

4642
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:21,520
cannabis

4643
02:41:18,719 --> 02:41:23,438
as you've said as we've talked about is

4644
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:27,359
a matriarchal

4645
02:41:23,439 --> 02:41:28,720
industry it is a plant that we smoke is

4646
02:41:27,359 --> 02:41:32,960
a female plant

4647
02:41:28,719 --> 02:41:36,719
it is a matriarchal community and

4648
02:41:32,959 --> 02:41:37,839
america is as you know father first as

4649
02:41:36,719 --> 02:41:41,278
it gets

4650
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:42,398
so that threatens the fabric as you said

4651
02:41:41,279 --> 02:41:44,560
of america

4652
02:41:42,398 --> 02:41:45,519
but it needs to be threatened and it

4653
02:41:44,559 --> 02:41:48,680
needs to be

4654
02:41:45,520 --> 02:41:51,040
sowed the the matriarchy and the

4655
02:41:48,680 --> 02:41:53,439
minority-led

4656
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:55,359
empowerment that cannabis provides is

4657
02:41:53,439 --> 02:41:57,840
one of the most exciting things about

4658
02:41:55,359 --> 02:42:00,318
being in this community

4659
02:41:57,840 --> 02:42:01,680
yeah i think we can cannabis um

4660
02:42:00,318 --> 02:42:05,039
definitely

4661
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:07,600
can be an industry that we can

4662
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:10,399
we can we can pioneer this movement

4663
02:42:07,600 --> 02:42:13,520
continue to

4664
02:42:10,398 --> 02:42:15,358
show that we all can work together that

4665
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:16,640
you know through medicine to what

4666
02:42:15,359 --> 02:42:19,520
through wellness

4667
02:42:16,639 --> 02:42:21,920
um we can create like cultural change

4668
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:25,680
from the root you know from the seed

4669
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:28,000
um if you really i i always like to uh

4670
02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:29,920
take it back whether it's in business as

4671
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:33,040
far as the industry goes or

4672
02:42:29,920 --> 02:42:34,239
as far as medicine go like we are just

4673
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:37,439
planting seeds

4674
02:42:34,239 --> 02:42:38,639
whether it's education the scientific

4675
02:42:37,439 --> 02:42:41,680
aspect of it

4676
02:42:38,639 --> 02:42:42,799
the cultural aspect of it the social

4677
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:46,079
aspect of it

4678
02:42:42,799 --> 02:42:48,879
we're planting seeds um in

4679
02:42:46,079 --> 02:42:49,520
literally and figuratively figuratively

4680
02:42:48,879 --> 02:42:52,159
speaking

4681
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:54,239
and um we just got to be patient and

4682
02:42:52,159 --> 02:42:56,879
continue to do the good work

4683
02:42:54,239 --> 02:42:58,159
um and the plants will sprout and

4684
02:42:56,879 --> 02:43:01,039
eventually

4685
02:42:58,159 --> 02:43:01,760
we will we will be causing a radical

4686
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:04,240
change

4687
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:05,279
um positive change for not only for

4688
02:43:04,239 --> 02:43:07,520
america but

4689
02:43:05,279 --> 02:43:08,800
global at a global scale that's that's

4690
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:11,840
how much i do

4691
02:43:08,799 --> 02:43:12,799
believe uh in not only what we're all

4692
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:14,880
doing here but

4693
02:43:12,799 --> 02:43:15,840
like the plan itself and where we can

4694
02:43:14,879 --> 02:43:19,039
take this

4695
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:21,760
so amy and sister amen

4696
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:24,080
farming and agriculture and cultivation

mono cropping and monoculture is

4698
02:43:24,079 --> 02:43:29,039
never sustainable you need a bit of

4699
02:43:26,959 --> 02:43:29,759
everything you need a broad spectrum of

4700
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:31,920
everything

4704
02:43:36,318 --> 02:43:38,799
in our culture as well or our

4705

4729
02:44:27,359 --> 02:44:30,399
i've had this week

4730
02:44:28,719 --> 02:44:32,000
the universe is putting us all in each

4731
02:44:30,398 --> 02:44:33,920
other's paths and we're all asking

4732
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:35,439
the same questions how do we get this

4733
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:37,040
knowledge out there how do we make a

4734
02:44:35,439 --> 02:44:39,279
change what can we do

4735
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:40,319
in my neighborhood in my family my town

4736
02:44:39,279 --> 02:44:42,560

4739
02:44:44,559 --> 02:44:47,278
can help each other to move this forward

4740
02:44:46,478 --> 02:44:50,079
as well

4741
02:44:47,279 --> 02:44:50,720

and

4743
02:44:50,719 --> 02:44:54,318
this is what it's going to take to get

4744
02:44:52,239 --> 02:44:54,959
us to move forward is conversations like

4745
02:44:54,318 --> 02:44:56,959
this

4746
02:44:54,959 --> 02:44:58,079
and you know we all each have a piece of

4747
02:44:56,959 --> 02:44:59,438
this puzzle

4748
02:44:58,079 --> 02:45:01,600

4749
02:44:59,439 --> 02:45:02,800
together and how many more people are

4750
