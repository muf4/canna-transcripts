00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,569
[Music]

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,570
the appellations project man sir Ivan

3
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:17,429
this is something that you hold near and

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,839
dear and I know some other people that

5
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:22,170
are tied to it but really you talked

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,929
about this at an earlier future cannabis

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,000
project video in a basement in Venice

8
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:29,910
and an old speakeasy of all places with

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,899
some very interesting folks so tell us a

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,140
little bit about that because that's

11
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:38,579
really what put things on the map yes so

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,359
nice fun part in the pond yeah so we so

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,070
the founder of the Mendocino

14
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,899
appellations project one of the things

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,640
that we did with a with the Appalachians

16
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,189
was that you know I come from a design

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,980
background and I had been building

18
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,140
greenhouses I mean I've been in the

19
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:53,609
California industry for about 22 years

20
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,329
so I'm very familiar with Northern

21
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,769
California and the cannabis trade I

22
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,390
understood what was going on from a

23
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,920
political standpoint because of course

24
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,739
you know I was on the other side of the

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,049
gate and then I was on the Food Policy

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,020
Council so I was working a lot with

27
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,299
policy around food you know over policy

28
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:16,739
development you know for food and also

29
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,860
writing online software programs for you

30
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:21,390
know virtual food hubs for distribution

31
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:24,060
decentralizing production farm-to-table

32
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,250
dinner series for about 10 years so had

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,430
this idea of small batch craft and how

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,009
to how to support taking cannabis money

35
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,070
and supporting the local food system and

36
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,829
then I got arrested 2012 and ended up

37
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:41,158
very publicly exposed for my work in

38
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:43,319
nonprofit sector and you know I had a

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,299
choice either apologize for being in the

40
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,679
cannabis industry which we had supported

41
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,380
all this great work to that point or

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,759
step up and do something got into policy

43
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:56,099
council development to develop the

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,349
Mendocino Policy Council with a few

45
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:59,419
other Mendocino kind of cannabis policy

46
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:00,978
council with a

47
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,728
with a you know few other people and

48
00:02:00,978 --> 00:02:06,260
then my skill set was really in that

49
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:07,879
design so I was like I was noticing

50
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,610
where I really get in where you fit in

51
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:12,109
and I started drawing this map I started

52
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,730
drawing an Appalachians map they've

53
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,200
heard the concept of Appalachians of the

54
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:17,810
wine regions France grew up with them

55
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:20,539
there's like super stoked on you know on

56
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,659
how they had developed what it seems

57
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:25,280
protections for small batch and craft

58
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:28,849
wine producers yeah you know very

59
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,949
similar protecting products of place

60
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:33,109
essentially protecting IP because when

61
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:35,149
you give the farmer IP you give them the

62
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,640
power not the corporation's correct so

63
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,260
the market then demands back to the IP

64
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,689
which is connected to the land and the

65
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:44,269
land owners versus the corporation and

66
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:46,939
the product so it's products of place

67
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:49,640
and of place being the number one

68
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:52,099
determinant so drawing that map really

69
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,979
was cementing our regional heritage and

70
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:56,659
legacy moving forward and then drove

71
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:58,340
around with the map and you saw the map

72
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,229
today but you know with the pin I've

73
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,030
seen so that's a state map so this is

74
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:03,379
our first shot at doing a state map

75
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,310
where as you guys are down at my neck of

76
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,519
the woods I think you're out in the

77
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:12,049
desert no no no no we're launching we we

78
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,209
do we do mapping so we're identifying

79
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:17,299
regions where cannabis is being produced

80
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:20,590
in geographical indications settings not

81
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:23,239
necessarily for appellation of origin so

82
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,219
the expression the metabolome expression

83
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,530
of the plant this relationship with Sun

84
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:30,349
and soil is the most important thing so

85
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,400
therefore desert it's not really a place

86
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:33,439
where you can do that you have to do it

87
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,420
engineered or inside and that's yeah you

88
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,430
don't get an appellation so but anyway

89
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:39,349
you know it was a really good way to

90
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,360
protect small-batch and craft cannabis

91
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:42,859
producers there's a real way to protect

92
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,799
the legacy and heritage of the region

93
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,079
and a real way to you know make a

94
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,810
quality differentiation in the

95
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,430
marketplace and so which we hope to see

96
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,530
forward with organizations like emerald

97
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,750
exchange and and craft Kenneth's

98
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,340
producers everywhere so how that that

99
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,539
affected a bit of the policy here in the

100
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,939
state California right because I know

101
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:03,590
there's certain brands like Humboldt

102
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:05,120
will pick on one that had to segue their

103
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,859
name into ptosis to go through that

104
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,819
because of the Appalachians grabbing

105
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:11,060
just as

106
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:14,598
yeah I mean so you can't claim the name

107
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,728
of a place necessarily as the brand name

108
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:18,228
yes you know and a lot of people are

109
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:19,969
gonna start to see that when Appalachian

110
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:23,180
petitions start to come in there's gonna

111
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:26,620
be this huge backlash against all the

112
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,970
brands that have the name of either a

113
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,500
lot of it comes down to the strain names

114
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,850
as well you know so it's like Big Sur

115
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,639
holy Bud is an example that were

116
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,810
tremendous and brought up the other day

117
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,220
you know that's that's really because

118
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,220
the Big Sur holy but it was just call it

119
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,190
holy mud grown in Big Sur California and

120
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,229
or Big Sur Appalachian giving the power

121
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:47,569
back to the Appalachian not the strain

122
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:49,879
you give to the strain Dickie grow it in

123
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:51,439
Ethiopia and have Big Sur holy breath

124
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,389
growing all around the world and it

125
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,310
doesn't necessarily maintain that same

126
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:57,978
marker of quality that it comes from

127
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,288
that specific region so holy bud grown

128
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:02,839
in Big Sur then becomes the marker of

129
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:04,848
quality makes sense so so getting into

130
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,560
this and you you know we hate to compare

131
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:08,899
this industry to the alcohol industry

132
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:16,038
but it's kind of hard not to and it's

133
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:18,709
one of those things where celestial

134
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:21,019
brands anheuser-busch we know Miller

135
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:22,728
Coors has been focused on for a minute

136
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,930
so I'll ask both of you could start with

137
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:25,490
you ricardo because something's in your

138
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,598
back yard I mean Miller Coors is right

139
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,810
down the street from you in Golden

140
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:31,939
Colorado yeah sure so what do you think

141
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,158
of as some of these mainstream alcohol

142
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:36,800
and even more recently obviously tobacco

143
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:39,800
companies where do you see us in a year

144
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,500
as far as the larger corporations versus

145
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,288
the smaller micro if you will versus

146
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:49,399
macro I think this is only the beginning

147
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:51,259
and apparently that guy agrees but no

148
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,879
this is only the beginning right I mean

149
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:56,449
we're just seeing the first giant

150
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:59,240
alcohol brand the first few big beer

151
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:02,090
brands of course now Altria the owner of

152
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,810
Philip Morris International is is in the

153
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:07,969
game with a very legitimate

154
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:10,370
billion at 1.8 billion dollar investment

155
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:13,520
in in Cronos up in Canada we're gonna

156
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:17,610
see a lot more of this I think it was

157
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:20,219
45% oh well that's what Rachel 4:55

158
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,500
totally but yeah but ya know that it's

159
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,050
it's only it's only amplifying we're

160
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,610
going to see so much more of this and I

161
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,310
think it's inevitable and I think the

162
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,379
only thing we need to be aware of is

163
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:34,259
most of these industries have not been

164
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:36,150
the most accountable have not been the

165
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:38,580
most transparent or honest and we just

166
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:40,709
need to be conscientious about what

167
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:42,568
their involvement could mean for the

168
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:44,098
potential future of this industry and

169
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:47,039
the businesses they're involved with

170
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:49,199
because you could watch madmen you could

171
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,598
watch another number of documentaries

172
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,000
and read books but but yeah especially

173
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:56,098
Big Tobacco and and and of course let's

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,620
not forget pharmaceutical because the

175
00:06:56,098 --> 00:07:02,908
largest donor to the opposition campaign

176
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:05,848
and in 2016 election in Arizona was

177
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:07,649
iNSYS therapeutics proud Ares active

178
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:11,250
item a bit that was an interesting story

179
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:14,728
I know maker have a crazy strong and

180
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,459
deadly fentanyl but I think we need to

181
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:20,158
just keep an extra close eye on these

182
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:23,068
entities you know whether it's Pharma

183
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:25,560
alcohol nicotine to make sure that

184
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:26,218
they're not practicing the ill deeds of

185
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,750
their past

186
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:33,120
now what's your takes I mean this is we

187
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,079
know you've grown up not too far from

188
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,848
where I grew up up here

189
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,500
and we've seen it with like the micro

190
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:39,569
booze right I mean very few but we try

191
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,399
to keep these micro brews from jumping

192
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:43,319
the shark so to speak and go into a bee

193
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,269
and become a just in our name like Goose

194
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,789
Island or Breckenridge brewery Colorado

195
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:50,068
so how do you see that playing out

196
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:52,110
NorCal hasn't been true that companies

197
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,028
like in the nicotine space of in

198
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,129
purchasing property up here is north of

199
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:58,019
San Francisco you know you never know

200
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:59,729
that's the thing right you never know

201
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,769
until you do and then all of a sudden

202
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:04,318
it's like

203
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:07,348
you get into the common sense right it's

204
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,020
like who the hell would want to move to

205
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:12,659
Northern California and produce 10,000

206
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:15,180
square feet of craft cannabis when they

207
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,889
can go down into Imperial Valley Central

208
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,689
Valley she'll be good at the Coachella

209
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:20,610
Valley they can go down to you know

210
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:22,649
Salinas they can go to Carpinteria they

211
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,169
can go to San Luis Obispo and they can

212
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:26,848
grow a million square feet of really

213
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:28,948
beautiful cannabis that they can put

214
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:31,050
into packaging and sell for a premium in

215
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:34,019
the consumer marketplace like Los

216
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:36,990
Angeles San Diego Sacramento at

217
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:38,338
literally you know pennies a gram you

218
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,750
know you're looking at some of these new

219
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,409
productions coming a little bit five

220
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,480
cents a gram at scale right let's just

221
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:48,088
say at 10 cents a gram we're at $45 a

222
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,470
pound right five cents a gram we're at

223
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:56,580
twenty to fifty a pound so we would have

224
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:58,709
to grow tens of thousands of pounds here

225
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,370
just to support the taxes and the

226
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:05,479
mortgage on our farms so the idea that

227
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:08,429
we would ever survive as the commodities

228
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,230
competitor it doesn't even make sense so

229
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:12,088
we're extremely hopeful and optimistic

230
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,430
because at the end of the day we have

231
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:16,950
projects we have media projects telling

232
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:18,539
the story of who did carry this torch

233
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,550
for this number of years right so it's

234
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:22,949
like I've got 22 years of shipping out

235
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:26,269
of out of you know Northern California

236
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,740
you know five you know five decades of

237
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,360
production I mean it's a legacy and a

238
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,028
heritage they carry the torch for

239
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,970
everyone now if industry comes in and

240
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:39,899
decides they want to homogenize an

241
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:43,320
entire region right then it'd be kind of

242
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,820
an asshole move right so and and it

243
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,649
doesn't make very much sense it seems

244
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,778
spiteful ucba just tried to do something

245
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:50,549
very similar the retail space or they

246
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:52,289
were saying like well we're gonna we're

247
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:54,240
gonna block events and we're gonna block

248
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:55,980
small-batch crafts cultivators from

249
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,799
having direct access to consumers yes

250
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,830
and

251
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:02,500
and you know not because they had to but

252
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,149
because they could you know not because

253
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,980
it made sense but just because they were

254
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:07,659
kind of pulling the little jerk move and

255
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,060
and that's okay you know we see people

256
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:11,769
doing that all the time but one thing

257
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:13,750
they can't have is Northern California

258
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:14,350
the one thing they can't have is our

259
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,330
redwoods

260
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,649
they can't have our land right they

261
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,330
can't have the millions of people that

262
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,490
come up here to visit our coastlines

263
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,440
they can't have all of these things that

264
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,080
we already have and trains it

265
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,570
intrinsically linked to our to you know

266
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:32,259
to our survival already which is tourism

267
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:36,580
dollars yeah right so we have an

268
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:38,169
industry now we just have to say I was

269
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,870
lucky that I got to take that yoga class

270
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:42,549
you know for 10 years I was lucky that I

271
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,470
got to coach soccer for those years I

272
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:45,699
was lucky that I got to do all those

273
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,649
things that was a blessing it was a gift

274
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,390
that the medicine gave to me super great

275
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,190
now I got to pick up the hammer and the

276
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:54,220
saw again I got to learn how to build a

277
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,270
gland yeah I've got I've got it you know

278
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,800
I'm gonna go down to the thrift store

279
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:58,899
I got a Venice Beach out my little

280
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:02,078
glamping tent and charge $200 a night

281
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:04,240
and give him a joint so it's like that's

282
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,519
what that's what we do and we just have

283
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,759
to wait we have to stop crying we have

284
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,740
to stop scaling because if we scale up

285
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,958
to 10,000 square feet we're taking all

286
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,120
of our good resources and dumping it

287
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,859
into a failing market yeah which is the

288
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,919
commodity space we are not commodities

289
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:27,310
farmers I can produce 10,000 square feet

290
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:31,299
of crap right and yeah but but but and

291
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:33,250
or I could produce you know 2500 square

292
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:35,139
feet of the finest cannabis on the

293
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,480
planet and people will pay for that a

294
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:39,970
little pay for that the premium is it so

295
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,070
we just need to just go back to what it

296
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,980
was that we were doing before yeah you

297
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:46,959
know we're homesteaders now a lot of us

298
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,820
moved up here is economics Refuge and so

299
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,439
now we've learned how to farm we've

300
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,000
learned how to build we've learned how

301
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,200
to survive we've learned how to pump our

302
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,179
own water we've learned how to do all

303
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,860
these great things now we just get to

304
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:58,629
share those gifts and skills with the

305
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,820
rest of the world yeah in the world is

306
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:02,649
gonna change I think it is you're right

307
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,580
and we had Kevin Joe jury a mutual

308
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:05,080
friend of both of ours

309
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,459
Kevin Joe tree on and you know some of

310
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,339
the things that he's doing specifically

311
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:11,619
in humble I mean it has that name has

312
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:14,110
such a reputation internationally as his

313
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,278
Mendocino but humble definitely does and

314
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,778
that's what we talked about like some of

315
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,309
that you know we've got to bring this

316
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:20,200
money in gotta bring the right money in

317
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:21,429
the positive money in and tourism is

318
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,110
where it's at because this is still an

319
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:26,528
epicenter I mean traveling to places

320
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,579
like you know Spain for for spannabis

321
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:30,250
so you're traveling just getting back

322
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:32,828
from cannafest Prague I mean there's

323
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,019
people they know these names they're

324
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:36,759
synonymous with top-quality fire not to

325
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,950
say good genetics don't exist in Europe

326
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:40,750
- but Northern California definitely has

327
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,670
that image it should be well it also

328
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,409
also is going to be the capital of

329
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:46,240
regenerative farming across the world

330
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:48,879
because at the end of the day we were

331
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:53,259
behind locked gates and we we became

332
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:56,049
permaculturist by also by necessity we

333
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:57,759
shared by necessity we communicated and

334
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:59,679
became community by necessity we were

335
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,299
geographically isolated we can teach the

336
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,539
world these values in these skills and

337
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:06,129
an institute style retreat style basis

338
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:07,240
we can bring people up and teach them to

339
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:09,309
be permaculturist

340
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,810
right and we can show them living

341
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:11,769
systems that we've been building over

342
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:13,689
decades as well

343
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:15,458
losing the closed loop forwards up there

344
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,130
is a good example these guys from

345
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:20,259
aquaponics to film I mean composting

346
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:22,679
annualized I mean it's it's it's really

347
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:26,019
a digitized an ocular inoculants

348
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:28,750
microbiome in ground soil like I mean we

349
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:30,639
that we do it so we do polyculture for

350
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,049
real you know you mentioned home stairs

351
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,240
because that's one thing Kevin under

352
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:36,189
this guy's so great you if you guys know

353
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,320
if you grab probably fuel Howser right

354
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,089
with California gold I compared cavity

355
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,950
collards this guy moved from Tennessee

356
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:43,450
but he knows more probably about

357
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,399
California specifically north to San

358
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,350
Francisco the most natives that I grew

359
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,899
up with and here this guy is just so he

360
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,370
preaches it so well but the education

361
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:54,220
that he shares as far as what's going on

362
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:57,820
in the fact that the largest acreage a

363
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,579
privately held property by far is in

364
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,170
that county of this entire state I think

365
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:04,149
that says a lot about the whole

366
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:04,860
neighbors and how you all coexist and

367
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:06,720
make

368
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,060
happen and do it as a collaborative

369
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,710
right do it as a team effort more more

370
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:15,529
so now than ever so what do you feel

371
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:18,389
about you know we had we had a Mendocino

372
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:20,100
once a Mendocino generations on earlier

373
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:21,389
that we were talking to you so as a

374
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,040
project like that something that's

375
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:24,960
making a difference to your point as far

376
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,360
as taking care of the smaller growers

377
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,160
well I mean so Mendocino generations is

378
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,600
positioned on green fields ranch which

379
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,490
is the oldest intentional community in

380
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,800
Mendocino County so back to the lenders

381
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,440
in the 1960s came back planet cannabis

382
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,509
you're seeing Mendocino generations are

383
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,810
the second and third generation farmers

384
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:45,090
from that original group of lenders from

385
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:46,859
San Francisco yeah right and it's

386
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:49,920
hilarious I mean I've stayed and hung

387
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,690
out and you know you know in in green

388
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,399
fields for a while he's watch sunsets on

389
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,200
at Steve Ryan's property before he

390
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,539
passed on the top of the hill and you

391
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,970
know and watch his big 25 you know

392
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:02,759
monster you know ten pounders and you

393
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,410
know and in you know and and I've rented

394
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,299
a property across the street in Running

395
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:07,889
Springs for a while and I got to know a

396
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,789
lot of these guys and got to know a lot

397
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:11,309
of these people in the Mendocino

398
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:13,110
generations and they're it's a really

399
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:15,479
unique model a lot of them are micro

400
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,460
branding right but then they're still

401
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,539
putting it into the common pot to then

402
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,680
support Arkana

403
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:23,370
which is their flower right in the

404
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,389
market so it's so it's really cool it's

405
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,759
kind of get that like sort of like

406
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:28,529
Thundercats transformers model where

407
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,590
like they all come together make this

408
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:33,779
super thing and then they kiss micro

409
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,550
thing yeah I've been running farmers

410
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,750
markets in Mendocino County for five

411
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:39,029
years now

412
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,740
we would rent out of a hall and we would

413
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:42,389
do it below ground and you know it

414
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,340
underground farmers markets and our

415
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:45,330
original farmers that would come down

416
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,730
from the hills we're coming down from

417
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:49,800
Thompson and green fields but geo was

418
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,970
one of the original farmers and she was

419
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,429
one of the original brands as well

420
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,019
madrone you know Arkana

421
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:57,120
Mendocino generation yeah some now

422
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,949
blazing Oaks is working with those guys

423
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,259
like so you're getting a lot of these

424
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,509
farmers that are coming in through three

425
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:05,730
sisters you know a lot of these brands

426
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:08,279
that are able to be their own farmers

427
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,019
market booth out of booth space and then

428
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,429
when we come to a larger space come

429
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,710
together and without me otherwise

430
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:16,019
and that's a cooperative model it's

431
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,610
necessary in all industries that's

432
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,939
another thing that we can teach people

433
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:23,700
is how to act like like an organism like

434
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,220
actually act like humans right that live

435
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,980
in community existing coexist and move

436
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,019
that model into economy right and start

437
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,420
creating economies of scale that aren't

438
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:36,449
necessarily scaled large but they're

439
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:38,069
replicas Blee small and scalable and

440
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,600
that's what and that's what we see with

441
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,410
our kana and it's an actual working

442
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,870
model and and being agile and adaptive

443
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:47,730
like that it's going to allow them to

444
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,070
survive because what Darwin adapt and

445
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,720
survive right so we are doing that model

446
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,370
and it's funny you mentioned we just had

447
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,570
this kind of became a bit of an

448
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,429
international show and we'll get into

449
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,870
like the vibe on the show from you I

450
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:59,909
want to hear from both you it's just

451
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,919
it's not your first radio Ricardo it is

452
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:04,078
so I can't wait to talk on that as well

453
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,970
for this specific event but we just had

454
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,308
some of our friends from Santiago Chile

455
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,019
it came up they just did that at Expo

456
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:11,759
wheat they're like hey Lance we want to

457
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:13,289
get you in these five other brands

458
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,970
together and do this a collaborative and

459
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:16,139
I was like a hundred percent makes total

460
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,120
sense they were all brands that

461
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,009
complemented each other we had similar

462
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,509
messaging and mantras Rick you and I

463
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:24,000
were just talking most a minute but ago

464
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:25,470
the culture matters in a company and we

465
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,689
want to align ourselves with other

466
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,610
companies that have this similar culture

467
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:30,150
and ethic and that's exactly what this

468
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:31,589
was

469
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,990
see welcome and yeah it was a cost

470
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:35,730
savings as this is that but the fact

471
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,380
that we had that continuity and we're

472
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,630
all able to co-exist I mean that's again

473
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,110
I agree it should be a more than just we

474
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:45,990
grow flour it can be meaningful but I

475
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:48,209
mean also it's it's it's the things that

476
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,710
we can teach one another right but it's

477
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,049
also things that we should just be

478
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,670
learning from other industries so we

479
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:55,558
shouldn't be teaching it's like you know

480
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,779
you go to consumer packaged goods and

481
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,329
you look what's happening there because

482
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:02,250
almost all of that will be applicable in

483
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:07,558
the cannabis industry of the future even

484
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:09,539
if it's not that way yet so but then we

485
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:13,379
ask the question this is the question is

486
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:16,409
it right right should we be learning

487
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,210
from extractive industries that have

488
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,519
destroyed the planet or should we be

489
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:23,160
teaching regenerative systems to

490
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:24,808
industries and getting into the policy

491
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,660
see that's the thing as we now

492
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:30,119
have grassroots policy advocates that

493
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,370
are getting in and changing laws and so

494
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,928
we can change packaging laws because you

495
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:36,000
know what at the end of the day it was

496
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:37,740
our survival on the line of whether or

497
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,089
not we were packaging or not packaging

498
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,769
at this I mean I've watched brands

499
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:42,720
packaged for six months spent all of

500
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:45,450
their money and then the BCC changes

501
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,400
package and and we as small batch

502
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,590
cultivators can't afford a twenty thirty

503
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,330
thousand dollar packaging head yeah so

504
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:52,980
we get back in and we advocate and we

505
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:55,349
write and we become participatory

506
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,390
democracy we can teach industry that we

507
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:59,159
don't have to roll over for policy we

508
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,410
can change policy to change industry to

509
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,179
become less extractive to the whole and

510
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,679
that's something that cannabis is going

511
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,298
to teach people it's a teacher it's a

512
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,548
plant spirit right so it's taught us for

513
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:10,889
all these decades how to act right to

514
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:12,450
the earth how to honor the earth and now

515
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,910
that we're moving into industry now we

516
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,620
have to act right an industry needs to

517
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:18,750
follow suit because at the end of the

518
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:20,699
day the parents climate Accord and what

519
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,140
happened with Donald Trump and what's

520
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,410
happening around the world it's it's an

521
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,419
up it's an a cry it's a rallying cry for

522
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,730
humans to start acting in a way that's

523
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:32,700
in accordance with their mother or get

524
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,710
kicked out like like we're out so we

525
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,179
have to change and I think cannabis had

526
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,340
a larger sense it's like telling us like

527
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,470
please change these other industries

528
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:44,609
please for the love of all things holy

529
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:46,589
yeah well and and I God man I hope

530
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:49,349
you're right and I wish you were right I

531
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:51,928
think it comes down to how we treat the

532
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:54,599
plants and how we treat our resources

533
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:57,090
absolutely but it also comes down to how

534
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:59,250
we treat our human capital and you know

535
00:19:57,089 --> 00:20:00,899
I think we all hoped that this industry

536
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,929
could be different than any other

537
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:06,179
industry right and we saw early numbers

538
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:08,490
like let's just talk about how we you

539
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:12,240
know were three dudes up here how do we

540
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:15,120
treat our women partners in this mix and

541
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,179
and and they deserve more because what

542
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,699
is the average number of women in CEO or

543
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:23,990
ownership positions in traditional

544
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,990
industries it's in the twenty percent

545
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:31,210
to your point in this industry we were

546
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,370
know and and it has declined every year

547
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,200
the last three to four years and so I

548
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:36,819
want cannabis to be better I want to

549
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,308
believe that we can be but right now

550
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:45,278
we're just proving to be to just fulfill

551
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:47,710
this inevitably sad pathetic destiny of

552
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:51,970
being yet another industry controlled by

553
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:54,610
the patriarchy and I will tell you that

554
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,610
you know it is empowering as a white

555
00:20:54,609 --> 00:21:00,308
male in this industry to hand that over

556
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:03,878
we had Jessica cure our as our CEO per

557
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:07,000
number a year have not get amazing as

558
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:08,469
soon as she left like I asked Michael's

559
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,378
girlfriend I was like Theresa will you

560
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,120
please be our CEO like it because we

561
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:17,109
need that female leadership because

562
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:19,449
cannabis sativa L you know as feminized

563
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,369
now like in the seedless cannabis is

564
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,440
what we're smoking it's a female it's a

565
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:26,168
goddess it's what we're so like needs to

566
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,230
be female run an executive director of

567
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:32,019
Matt Janine Coleman she cranks out like

568
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,089
30 emails before breakfast she's amazing

569
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:40,028
she's a workhorse that's the type of

570
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:44,589
leadership that we need because Taylor

571
00:21:40,028 --> 00:21:46,240
Blake Taylor Blake you know yes III was

572
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:52,269
in on this with it you know watching

573
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:55,089
Taylor run this pretension yeah Tim

574
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:58,480
started but tailored jacket you know and

575
00:21:55,089 --> 00:22:00,638
and and and yeah exactly so well yes so

00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:04,449
birthday and and it was Desmond's

578
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:06,038
birthday and then it became and then and

579
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:09,009
then you know and then it became the

580
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:12,849
judge but anyway but yeah so but but but

581
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:14,950
to say it is I see that is so great the

582
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:17,138
way though she wants to be handed off to

583
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:19,750
the female and how the females are

584
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:21,819
acting so well in the space and it is an

585
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,288
it's teaching me I mean at least I'm

586
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:25,069
learning so if anybody else doesn't

587
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:26,898
learn at least

588
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:28,970
that's a good transition because that's

589
00:22:26,898 --> 00:22:31,038
exactly the last question I had and

590
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:34,399
again we kind of talked about off camera

591
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:36,319
but Ricardo came up from Northern

592
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:38,329

years ladies and gentlemen and very much

597
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:51,439
an advocate for the industry but this is

598
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,388
your first era most cut this kind of

599

Emerald cup thank you for the welcome

601
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:02,778

602
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:05,659
you have to come here to get it I get it

603
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:08,480
now it's it's it's special it is it is

604
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:11,480
an expo it is a trade show but it's

605
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,159
infused with this spirit and and and

606
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,139
more than anything even though you know

607
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:18,528
of course there's the booths like this

608
00:23:15,138 --> 00:23:21,469
one that we'd expect but it still feels

609
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:23,089
like it's a celebration of sun-grown

610
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,009
cannabis which i think is what tim

611
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:28,730
started as originally all those years

612
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:31,069
ago and latent villain yeah I'm I'm I

613

615
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:38,538
and I can definitely say that I will be

616
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:41,298
back I'd love to have you back maybe

617
00:23:38,538 --> 00:23:42,888
we'll do a little little tour here there

618
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:44,929
next time you come up we have a couple

619
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,428
of friends just up the road love to show

620
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:48,259
you what they have going on and then you

621
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:49,489
we've discussed this before and that

622
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,929
Mike knows that's why I've been a

623
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:53,179
supporter of Emerald exchange since the

624
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,590
beginning but you kept in my opinion

625
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:56,570
living in Southern California and going

626
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:58,099
to an emerald emerald exchange this is

627
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:59,118
exactly what I compared it to just

628
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:01,219
bringing down that culture in that

629
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:03,798
NorCal vibe sits and you've heard about

630
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,450
this wreck you know norcal socal either

631
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:07,099
you claim one or the other it's funny if

632
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:09,470
you're from here it's like you know and

633
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:11,569
I'm NorCal everyone knows I hate LA I'm

634
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,419
not a fan I just not my the pretentious

635
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:17,298
the hole so when I went to my first I am

636
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:20,359
so not a fan of LA and I had to I do San

637
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:22,548
Francisco in my opinion is the best city

638
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:25,278
in the country not even the state but

639
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:26,989
it's efficient you look at LA nobody

640
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,388
drives in LA that there nobody walks

641
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:30,950
away that's a real song eyes definitions

642
00:24:29,388 --> 00:24:33,459
everyone has to drive compared to here

643
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,140
we're gonna be a rent-a-car Bruna's

644
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,870
six different means of mass transit but

645
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,759
I digress but you you captured this

646
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:41,199
that's a rich saw it like this is what

647
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,750
school is he's seen it this first year

648
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,660
you captured the energy of NorCal with

649
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,519
5060 small medium-sized growers and you

650
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,019
brought them down to of all places the

651
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:53,019
Santa Monica Mountains like we're

652
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:55,420
talking few miles from the Malibu finest

653
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:56,980
in the richest hoity-toity and how did

654
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,570
you do that like what and how does that

655
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,029
compare to what you've experienced over

656
00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:03,220
the years here so I was doing the the

657
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:04,869
exchange in Northern California so I was

658
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,049
doing a farmers market with an infused

659
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:10,359
dinner at night and I was you know you

660
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:12,940
know doing a banquet style table all

661
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:14,859
full farm-to-table 100% local within the

662
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,680
within the county and then I was

663
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:20,379
bringing out brands right mostly it

664
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,140
started with Mexican blankets and mason

665
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,540
jars right and then evolved into of

666
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:27,370
course bringing in branded you know and

667
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:29,109
and your neighbor right you know drawing

668
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:33,969
a really cute logo and getting it

669
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:37,689
printed and get you know those happen

670
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:40,240
but um I you know about two years

671
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:42,850
throwing the event in in the village of

672
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,579
Mendocino yeah and I went down to Malibu

673
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:47,559
I have a friend of mine who's Jeremy

674
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:50,019
from San bazan yeah you know so we're

675
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:51,849
down there sanctuary on PCH having a

676
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:54,369
conversation and one of our black-market

677
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:58,809
friends shows up and he starts talking

678
00:25:54,369 --> 00:26:01,509
shit about Sundra and I'm like he's

679
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:03,490
offering me like $900 and this is two

680
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:07,180
and a half years ago from you $900 for

681
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,049
og sun-grown pre-bought and I told him

682
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,910
that's bullshit

683
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:12,490
that he's gonna buy it for eighteen and

684
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,860
love it right and that I asked Jeremy if

685
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,450
there was a way that we could take the

686
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:20,349
event that we were doing in Northern

687
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:24,850
California and bring it down to SoCal on

688
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:27,459
to his land into Malibu and the the

689
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:31,240
thought was is how do we link a culture

690
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:33,519
right so it's like do I bring a large

691
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,039
group of humans from Northern California

692
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,210
and put it in downtown LA the large

693
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:40,339
group of humans

694
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:42,769
Southern California or do we take a

695
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:44,149
small group of humans from from you know

696
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:46,579
the village of Mendocino and from

697
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:49,340
Mendocino County hills and bring them to

698
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:51,259
another medicine culture a place where

699
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:53,149
you'll find teepees in your yards and

700
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:55,609
where there'll be a peyote ceremony

701
00:26:53,150 --> 00:27:00,350
possibly every other week and yoga and

702
00:26:55,609 --> 00:27:04,069
yoga and and and sound healing all of it

703
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:06,109
and and so our culture meeting their

704
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:08,418
culture so as to medicine culture is

705
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:11,509
actually meeting so coming in and then

706
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:13,970
you know creating this sort of you know

707
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:15,980
it's not really a festival it's more of

708
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,919
like a wellness activation so it's like

709
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,990
it's create creating activations you

710
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:23,270
know instead of just booths creating a

711
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,579
bazaar and then having the brands

712
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:28,639
actually have yurts and teepees and

713
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:30,859
tents and air streams and you know and

714
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,419
separating it out and then bring in

715
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:34,879
having something to do throughout the

716
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:37,280
entire day but really what it is is it's

717
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,260
that replicable small scalable model

718
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,149
where we were saying we're going to take

719
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:44,839
these small batch cultivators and go

720
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:47,960
directly to influencers media businesses

721
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:51,918
and and investors you know say help us

722
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,710
scale in a small way in a place that can

723
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,929
afford the margins that we need yeah

724
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,190
to do that you did a great job that's

725
00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:00,019
one thing I remember and I was so

726
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,210
impressed by and I think Jessica was a

727
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:03,859
bit of a force behind this as well but

728
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,048
coming from a digital media background

729
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:08,029
like Rick that you guys got a lot of

730
00:28:06,048 --> 00:28:10,250
coverage a lot of organic coverage yeah

731
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:12,440
that surprised me it wasn't just Lopes

732
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,509
pub per se well it's mainstream you want

733
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,558
to sit want a secret huh I'll give this

734
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:21,529
one over so the original meeting for the

735
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:23,058
Emerald exchange right that where I met

736
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:25,639
Michael cast yes actually my

737
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:29,538
sister-in-law Megan champion she hooked

738
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:33,650
me up with Michael Katz and then Matthew

739
00:28:29,538 --> 00:28:35,929
from foria and Britney come for Matthews

740
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:38,929
PR person and we're all at a dinner

741
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:39,389
hanging out and Matthew is very reserved

742
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:41,159
I don't

743
00:28:39,388 --> 00:28:43,038
you know Matthew well but Matt he's very

744
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:45,839
reserved I think things are a good idea

745
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,190
but he's strategic and he's built a

746
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:49,769
really great brand and a really good

747
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:52,709
business model and he's great but having

748
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:55,378
him come in as a sponsor was a little

749
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:58,919
bit iffy so what he did was he gave us

750
00:28:55,378 --> 00:29:01,078
Brittany his PR person his sponsorship

751
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:04,379
contribution was Brittany I did talk to

752
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:06,658
know all of that national media and

753
00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:09,298
local bougie media that foria was

754
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:14,999
getting then became our media with the

755
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:18,269
exchange and I hired Luiza and Jeremy's

756
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:20,608
wedding planner to come on and curate

757
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:23,788
the original event so we had bougie

758
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:26,668
media and a bougie Malibu wedding

759
00:29:23,788 --> 00:29:28,229
planner throw this event that was ended

760
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:29,849
up being the perfect storm and they came

761
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:32,369
out of the cover to the LA Weekly saying

762
00:29:29,848 --> 00:29:35,278
this farmers market proves that weed is

763
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:37,019
the new wine and that was it like as

764
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,878
soon as that headline comes out I was

765
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:41,638
like oui oui

766
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:44,009
it was a gated box it was amazing but

767
00:29:41,638 --> 00:29:45,898
you had a couple of trustafarians a

768
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:47,578
couple of the hipsters come up from

769
00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:49,618
Malibu a couple those spoiled kids but

770
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:51,118
it's cool because like it was it was

771
00:29:49,618 --> 00:29:52,588
even just the gas it was the people

772
00:29:51,118 --> 00:29:55,078
attending that kind of kept him in check

773
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:56,729
like they kind of came in with this la

774
00:29:55,078 --> 00:29:58,048
attitude and I remember people like

775
00:29:56,729 --> 00:29:59,578
they're sitting somewhere and kind of

776
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:01,408
being rude to someone they're like no we

777
00:29:59,578 --> 00:30:03,569
