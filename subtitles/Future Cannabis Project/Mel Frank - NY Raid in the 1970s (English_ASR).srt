1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,798
that year was a very successful year we

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,319
grew of a 500 pounds of top-notch that I

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,940
mean really top-notch sinsemilla and

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:10,070
these guys wanted to do it again the

5
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,899
next year and they were bringing in

6
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,690
money people right who were just drug

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,219
dealers and I didn't feel good about it

8
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:19,829
I didn't like the people I didn't like

9
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:23,160
the fact that they wanted to upscale so

10
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,929
much you know it all became it all came

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,480
the money you know I was more interested

12
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:30,329
and the actual growing and seeing what

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,739
happened and all that so the next year

14
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:35,909
they they they bought a 140 acres

15
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:42,119
further away from where we originally

16
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:45,750
grow and went at it and I was back in

17
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,979
California when I got a call in July to

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,429
come out there and help them and I

19
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:52,019
didn't really want to do that but I I

20
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:53,609
relented because of the few of the

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,329
people they just like everything they

22
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,539
had into it

23
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,920
so in fact he had a rescue him and this

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,390
was hard to believe they had gone

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,480
through a whole year of growing up this

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,728
very successful crop and didn't see who

27
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,259
haven't learned anything because they

28
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:09,239
went from a place that we were growing

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,340
in in like Bottomly and really rich

30
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,408
beautiful soil I mean we had to do

31
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,600
nothing to soil really you could put

32
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,270
your hand and it was and just reached

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,239
this beautiful soil so it was really

34
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,859
easy to grow the iron so weird they

35
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,019
would they buy this land they bought of

36
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,450
that you know another thousand fifteen

37
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,938
hundred feet higher where the soil was

38
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,939
rocky and Sandy in additionally New York

39
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,438
State that yeah and at a drought so yeah

40
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:36,478
you come and look at the plants they

41
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:39,709
have no no dude it's an award I know

42
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:42,539
what it they're not growing so anyway I

43
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:45,839
kind of remedied that and got them

44
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,509
growing well and sometime in late August

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,490
I had to come back to Oakland and it

46
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,500
does so I said you know I'll be back and

47
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:54,390
it will be right of the harvest and that

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,728
this crop would have been over at time

49
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,250
would have been over at time

50
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:00,359
but as I was flying back they got busted

51
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,250
okay

52
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,718
so they lost everything none of them

53
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,430
ended up in jail

54
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:07,769
partly because New York didn't

55
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,050
understand growing at that time like

56
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:12,598
they didn't understand the air before I

57
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,420
was standing in this this wonderful

58
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:17,019
field

59
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:18,818
and one of the guys came out he showed

60
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,620
me a local newspaper the headline was

61
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:23,500
that they estimated that the New York

62
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,110
State marijuana crop that year would be

63
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,479
worth a half a million dollars right and

64
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,470
I'm thinking it's worth more right here

65
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,000
you know

66
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:32,530
I'll be that's how little they knew

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,509
about it so when they got busted the

68
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,610
next year they didn't end up in jail

69
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:40,750
they just lost everything they lost a

70
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:42,310
fortune so they were lucky lucky for

71
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,959
that but you know I mean I never got

72
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,239
busted in my life

73
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,830
never been arrested and a lot of it had

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,939
to do with luck and a lot of it had to

75
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,000
do with the fact that I didn't

76
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:53,650
personally sell marijuana I didn't sell

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,509
seeds I didn't sell anything you know I

78
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,819
made money from my writing in my

79
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:01,269
photography in the other was that I

80
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:03,609
didn't take accept you know all these

81
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:06,640
offers that come to the Y he come to

82
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,019
here you know you know do the growing

83
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,259
for us you know you'll make a lot of

84
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:13,539
money and that wasn't really my interest

85
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:16,750
so much you know I really was fascinated

86
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:19,169
with the plant the botany and that's the

87
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,169
way I went
