2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,539
this is Mother Teresa

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:14,160
of course she won the Nobel Prize in

4
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:17,399
1979 for her work with afflicted

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,140
patients all over the globe how about

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:24,929
this guy anyone ever anyone recognize

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:29,399
this guy his name is Norman Borlaug and

8
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:32,789
he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for

9
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,829
ending and averting global famine this

10
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:37,439
was really the most pressing issue

11
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,780
confronting humanity at the time it was

12
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:43,289
sort of akin to the climate change of

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,960
his era Nobel Borlaug was a plant

14
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:48,738
pathologist by training and he

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,759
accomplished this work through breeding

16
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:54,049
that's why he's relevant to our talk

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:57,119
today you see after World War two

18
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:59,459
analysts thought that by the 70s or 80s

19
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,009
the rate of the growth of human

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,558
population would exceed the rate of

21
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:08,039
agricultural production that would lead

22
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:11,759
to catastrophic starvation and human die

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,460
off but Borlaug solved this problem by

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,180
breeding improved grain which increased

25
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:22,469
yield by over 500 percent and he thereby

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,350
saved over 100 million lives making him

27
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:29,129
arguably the most important figure in

28
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:32,039
human history so why am I talking about

29
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:33,810
Borlaug Borlaug's fascinating to me

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,540
because of a conversation I had recently

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,519
with an investor I told this investor

32
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,890
that we intended to double the average

33
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,780
per acre yield in cannabis in the next

34
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,700
couple of years and they couldn't

35
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,759
believe that was possible they were

36
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,909
incredulous frankly and I understand the

37
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,938
skepticism it seems like every day now

38
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,340
we hear new biotech startups coming into

39
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:59,699
the space pitching disruptive

40
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,880
technologies which will you know change

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,500
the market and disrupt the whole

42
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:06,718
agricultural production we're hearing

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,780
about molecular genomics we're hearing

44
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:12,340
about CRISPR we're hearing about bio

45
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:16,090
synthetic production of cannabinoids

46
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:18,759
we all want better faster stronger

47
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:22,629
plants but what's the right path to get

48
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:25,719
there the key to successful investing in

49
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:28,060
cannabis biotechnology is knowing which

50
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:31,989
of these approaches are likely to be

51
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,810
successful and which are mere fads I'm

52
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:37,509
here to say the the successful breeders

53
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:42,009
of the future will create elegant

54
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:48,099
programs which combine both judicious

55
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:51,639
science and artful breeding my vision

56
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:55,180
based on 12 years of experience in the

57
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:58,149
labs the fields the greenhouses and the

58
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,700
grow houses of California is a little

59
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,280
bit different I've boiled down this

60
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:06,219
vision to five points five rules for

61
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,129
elegant breeding they all combine

62
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:12,549
artistic intuitive concepts with

63
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:16,150
organized scientific concepts and we're

64
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:22,269
going to go over each individually rule

65
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:23,739
number one grow plants from seeds plant

66
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,689
production systems are something I know

67
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:27,670
a little bit about we're hearing a lot

68
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:29,409
lately especially about tissue culture

69
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:31,599
which again is something we have

70
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:34,120
experience with dark heart opened the

71
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,659
industry's first tissue culture lab back

72
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:41,430
in 2014 and tissue culture is a great

73
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:45,549
technology space-saving it creates clean

74
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:48,099
high-quality plants but the production

75
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:52,209
system requires very long lead times and

76
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:53,979
the costs are astronomical many will

77
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,989
tell you tissue culture is used

78
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:58,268
successfully in other agricultural crops

79
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:01,750
and they're right it's used for things

80
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,939
like bananas and other tropical plants

81
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,400
it typically as a means of last resort

82
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:09,419
the bananas that we grow are sterile you

83
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,159
can only grow them from tissue culture

84
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:14,679
most production in cannabis is produced

85
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,358
through clone this is how we make most

86
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,389
of our plants it's really the core

87
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:21,418
business of dark art nursery and these

88
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:25,300
plants can be very high quality as well

89
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:28,538
they're moderately fast to market

90
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,310
and relatively low priced but there's

91
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:32,649
very high disease pressure for these

92
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,589
plants and that makes it really hard to

93
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:39,038
operate a clonal system at scale over

94
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:41,198
time where we're going and where most of

95
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:45,339
the industry will go is to production

96
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:48,158
based on seedlings seedlings are the

97
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:52,149
highest quality lowest cost production

98
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:54,060
system they're the cleanest plants and

99
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:56,288
they have very low disease pressure

100
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,439
they're super low cost I mean we're

101
00:04:56,288 --> 00:05:01,000
talking pennies here not dollars

102
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,189
the problem with seeds is that there's

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,740
not there's not very much availability

104
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:07,810
of stabilized varietal so you get a lot

105
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,728
of variation in the crop that's a

106
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,949
problem that can be readily addressed by

107
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:15,579
breeding and it's one that we intend to

108
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:17,080
solve we do think that there's a role

109
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:18,609
for tissue culture and research and

110
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,378
development there's some advanced

111
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,030
technologies especially around phyto

112
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:24,009
sanitation that are great for tissue

113
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:28,918
culture but we don't see it as a

114
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:31,509
production system okay rule number two

115
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:34,060
include heritage breeders in your

116
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:36,340
program these are the guys that have

117
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,278
been here for decades at dark heart we

118
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:40,810
work with them day in and day out

119
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:43,538
they're farmers right

120
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,278
they understand this plant better than

121
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:48,250
anyone they've been doing it longer than

122
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:51,278
anyone and through grit and intuition

123
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:54,310
they've created an amazing abundance of

124
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:57,459
unique and interesting varietals that we

125
00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:00,310
consume in the market every day you know

126
00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:02,859
they can seem that they can seem sort of

127
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,658
low-tech and amateur from afar but I

128
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,968
have to tell you in three years I saw

129
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:10,990
these guys take the average CBD content

130
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:11,649
of varietals from 1 or 2 percent to 20

131
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,150
percent

132
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:16,568
it's amazing the work that they've done

133
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:19,120
given limited resources they're truly

134
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:21,639
the industry's artists and any great

135
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,430
program in breeding will build upon

136
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:28,210
rather than replace their work let's

137
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:31,180
look at an analogy this is the wild

138
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:33,728
mustard plant humans have been breeding

139
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,399
the wild mustard plant for perhaps tens

140
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:38,629
of thousands of years and that's looked

141
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,089
like sort of

142
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:45,230
creative amateurish breeding programs

143
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:47,719
very intuitive by farmers right across

144
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,220
many many generations and they've as a

145
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,070
result they've created these unique

146
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:55,940
species the broccoli the cauliflower the

147
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:59,349
Brussels sprout right none of us would

148
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:01,430
consider abandoning the broccoli and

149
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,830
neither should we consider abandoning

150
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:09,410
the breeders that have taken this plant

151
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:12,109
to where it is today successful breeding

152
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,710
programs again will combine this

153
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,270
intuitive artistic approach and

154
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:20,689
supplement it with modern scientific

155
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:24,379
approaches this is a well-known concept

156
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:27,829
amongst breeders but history is replete

157
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:29,750
with examples of breeding programs that

158
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:31,849
failed to acknowledge and incorporate

159
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,769
this basic concept we'll see some of

160
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:40,910
those examples here in a second okay

161
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:44,629
rule number three avoid tech fads this

162
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:46,910
is hard to do you know where there's so

163
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:49,579
much hype around these new technologies

164
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,590
right and I'm as excited as anyone we've

165
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:54,709
got these molecular breeding tools that

166
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:58,250
offer precision and so much power to the

167
00:07:54,709 --> 00:08:01,759
breeder we want to use them but I

168
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:05,990
caution you don't give the Nerds the

169
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,360
keys to the kingdom just because you

170
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:12,019
have a hammer doesn't mean the problem

171
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,600
is a nail the solutions we may be

172
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:18,680
looking for might not be technological

173
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,950
and any technology out of context will

174
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,949
fail

175
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:27,810
so in the 20s there was a great new

176
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:30,509
technology on the market where breeders

177
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:33,740
would apply x-ray technologies to seeds

178
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:37,049
this would induce mutations in the plant

179
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,719
and the purveyors of this technology

180
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,968
promised that it would create marvelous

181
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:46,250
new varietals that were quote-unquote

182
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,250
made to order sound familiar

183
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,419
at one point you could actually take

184
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:52,949
your seeds to like a local drug store or

185
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,929
something like that and they would have

186
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,970
you you could have them irradiated on

187
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:58,109
site and take them back to your take

188
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,350
them back to your garden and grow them

189
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,330
as interesting as that is you might not

190
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,000
be surprised to find out that this

191
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,460
technology had virtually zero commercial

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,409
applications it was all hype

193
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:14,100
all science you could see some of the

194
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:20,069
hype but no art there's no understanding

195
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:25,350
of the crop sometimes the technology can

196
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:27,690
distract a program with fads right other

197
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,940
times the program can implement good

198
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:36,390
strong techniques but the goals

199
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:39,270
themselves are misplaced that brings us

200
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:42,088
to rule number four consider consumers

201
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:47,819
it seems obvious but it hasn't always

202
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:50,870
been how about the tomato how do you

203
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:56,190
guys like your grocery store Tomatoes

204
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:57,690
here some people liking them so you know

205
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,460
the grocery store Tomatoes they look

206
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,710
great right they're too bright they're

207
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,060
firm they're colorful but they taste

208
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,240
like garbage I mean they taste like

209
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:08,609
water right and the reason is that since

210
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,710
the sixties tomato breeders have bred

211
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,960
for everything but flavor right they've

212
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:16,259
bred for mechanical harvesting they've

213
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,690
bred for firmness they've bred for pest

214
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,939
and disease but like literally the

215
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:25,950
consumer was not on the list of breeding

216
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:28,770
targets for tomato programs that

217
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,420
breeding was scientific but it didn't

218
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:33,509
consider the consumer it didn't consider

219
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:35,579
the end result of the program it focused

220
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:39,838
on agronomic traits alone

221
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:42,600
and that led the program astray you know

222
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,080
nowhere is this more of a problem than

223
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,700
in cannabis where flavor is king right

224
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,940
it's what our consumers are really

225
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,040
looking for and this problem in tomatoes

226
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,250
and other vegetable and fruit crops is

227
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,958
an ongoing problem in response to it

228
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,828
breeders in recent decades have sought

229
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:04,768
to apply molecular biotechnology tools

230
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:07,500
to correct it it actually led to the

231
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:10,919
introduction of the world's first GMO

232
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:13,980
crop which was created by a company

233
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,929
called Calgene here in California they

234
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:20,459
called this crop the flavor saver tomato

235
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:22,559
it was introduced in 1994 I mean it had

236
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:25,828
a gene that extended shelf-life of the

237
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:28,289
tomato so this allowed the tomato to

238
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:29,879
ripen on the vine which is the big

239
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:31,559
problem with tomato flavor so it's a

240
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,509
tomato that ripens on the vine can be

241
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,328
much sweeter and have a much better

242
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:37,950
flavor at market it should have been a

243
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,059
hit right it's the only market on it's

244
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,730
only only tomato on the market that

245
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:43,289
tastes great but the company was led by

246
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,990
scientists right they were eager to use

247
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:48,708
this GMO technology and they didn't

248
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:52,350
include input from farmers and other

249
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:54,119
other people in the supply chain as a

250
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,920
results they didn't really understand

251
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,190
the supply chain or the economics of the

252
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,719
commercial farming industry they didn't

253
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,730
start with really great tasting

254
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,910
varietals and they didn't start with

255
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:08,370
great yielding varietals as a result the

256
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:10,980
flavor saver tasted better but it didn't

257
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,589
taste that much better and it was really

258
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,539
hard to produce it was low yielding it

259
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:17,730
required special packaging to get it to

260
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:21,659
market the production costs were

261
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:24,659
sky-high and consumers rebelled at high

262
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:28,799
prices the product was ultimately

263
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:32,750
abandoned in 1997 and Calgene was sold

264
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:36,659
at a discount to Monsanto that same year

265
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:40,980
it brings us to rule number five use an

266
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:43,169
integrative approach most understand you

267
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,060
have to understand the context in which

268
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:46,679
you're breeding what are the targets and

269
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:48,929
what impact will they have on the supply

270
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,500
chain is breeding even the right way to

271
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:53,059
address

272
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,590
problem not only do you need

273
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:57,599
multidisciplinary scientists but you

274
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,700
also need stakeholders from across the

275
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,220
supply chain

276
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:05,070
imagine if Calgene had included farmers

277
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,110
and processors and distributors in their

278
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,340
breeding program they may have

279
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,289
identified some of these problems

280
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:16,019
earlier on and that would have allowed

281
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:17,849
them to pivot the project molecular

282
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,669
breeding technologies like the flavor

283
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,180
saver are super exciting but they have

284
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:27,120
their limits they allow really precise

285
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:29,429
targeting of genetic changes they're

286
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,330
like they you know they allow precise

287
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:35,309
control sort of like a scalpel right and

288
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:38,509
scalpels are really good really

289
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:41,939
important tools if you're doing surgery

290
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:43,549
but if you're building a house a scalpel

291
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,870
isn't of much use to you

292
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:52,199
breeding is much more like construction

293
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:55,649
than it is like surgery so let's go back

294
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,710
to Borlaug right what did he target that

295
00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:01,259
won him a Nobel Peace Prize yield right

296
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:03,540
yield average production of this plant

297
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:05,669
and really that's what almost all

298
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:08,039
breeding is about we talk about it in

299
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:11,069
different terms pest resistance drought

300
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:13,588
resistance other targets but most of

301
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:16,310
these are about yield and the thing with

302
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:19,170
yield is there's no gene for yield

303
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:23,039
there's no marker that can be identified

304
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:27,149
for yield yield is a complex interaction

305
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:30,269
of hundreds of genes and non-genetic

306
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:33,829
factors like environment production

307
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,829
system and others

308
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:41,039
here's the proof this is a graph of the

309
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:45,389
average of the improvement of corn

310
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:46,949
yields over the last 150 years now you

311
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,778
might consider the slope especially in

312
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,120
the modern era since the 60s to

313
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:54,990
represent the impact of breeding on the

314
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,360
crop and keep in mind corn is the most

315
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,299
important grain worldwide the u.s. crop

316
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,250
alone is worth 51 billion dollars a year

317
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:04,319
which makes it the biggest target for

318
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,870
research and development no cost is

319
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,329
spared on breeding corn every tool

320
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,828
available is used on corn now the thing

321
00:15:09,328 --> 00:15:13,469
that I like to point out here is you'll

322
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:15,899
see my call-out on the graph corn was

323
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:19,259
the corn genome was sequenced back in

324
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:21,028
2009 and we might expect that if modern

325
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,338
molecular genomics were breakthrough

326
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:25,409
technologies that the slope of that grow

327
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:29,040
the slope of that graph would have went

328
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:32,309
aggressively up but as you can see since

329
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,069
2009 corn breeding has stayed along the

330
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:36,629
steady path that it was already on

331
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,490
suggesting that although this tool may

332
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:43,198
have some uses it's certainly not a

333
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:45,690
breakthrough technology so let's go back

334
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,909
to Borlaug one more time right if it's

335
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:50,370
not technological breakthroughs what is

336
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:52,409
it that that makes a breeding program

337
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,448
successful what is it that made Borlaug

338
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:57,569
successful

339
00:15:53,448 --> 00:16:00,088
it's about elegant systems right how did

340
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:05,940
Borlaug increase the average yield of

341
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:09,540
wheat by 500 percent he bred two crops a

342
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:13,680
year that's it he bred two crops a year

343
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:14,789
that was his innovation Borlaug was

344
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,689
breeding here in the central highlands

345
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:20,759
of Mexico in this town called chip Ingo

346
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,589
right he realized that because of the

347
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,689
difference in latitude at the end of the

348
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:26,850
breeding season he could take his seat

349
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,560
and move it north to the Yaqui valley

350
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:32,040
where he could get a second grain season

351
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:34,018
here this was called shuttle breeding it

352
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,610
was a clever innovation in the breeding

353
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:38,810
system rather than a breakthrough

354
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:41,940
technology that clever innovation

355
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:45,268
accelerated the improvement of corn of

356
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:47,480
grain yields and it saved 100 million

357
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:47,480
lives

358
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:56,779
door locks solution wasn't genius but it

359
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:59,270
was elegant and unexpected and that kind

360
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:02,059
of elegance will drive successful

361
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,889
breeding programs in cannabis successful

362
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:07,909
programs in the future will combine

363
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:10,490
judicious science but they will include

364
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:14,200
the think they will include and

365
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:16,759
accelerate the experienced creative

366
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,500
intuitive artistic breeding that's

367
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:23,329
already here they certainly won't

368
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:30,289
replace it all right thank you take

369
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:33,740
questions hi Dan I wanted to ask because

370
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:36,079
you've pointed out the heritage farmers

371
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,710
and people have been developing brands

372
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:42,079
for strains for many years my question

373
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,630
is why aren't we seeing some of these

374
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,659
heritage strains on the market and in

375
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,730
the cannabis products Maui wowie

376
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,430
you know these type of brands that have

377
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:57,980
been around for many many years that

378
00:17:52,430 --> 00:18:00,140
were very flavorful very lovely strains

379
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,980
that I don't see on the market anywhere

380
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,690
so where are these well that's a really

381
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,250
good question you know it's interesting

382
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,299
because there's actually a lot of demand

383
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,150
in the market for some of those

384
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:12,379
varietals I would say the biggest thing

385
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,850
that I see is they're really hard to

386
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,160
come by these days some of them have

387
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:17,869
sort of just I mean that's the thing

388
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,150
about cannabis coming out of this

389
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:23,479
underground space is that many of these

390
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:25,100
programs just were lost over time so I

391
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,599
think in many ways there's a demand out

392
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:28,009
there for them but it's just an issue of

393
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:32,809
finding them and bringing them back to

394
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:35,470
market ok thank you Dan thank you very

395
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:35,470
much applause
