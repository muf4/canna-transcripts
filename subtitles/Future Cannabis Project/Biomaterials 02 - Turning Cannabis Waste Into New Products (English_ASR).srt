2
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:16,640
tell us about restock what what is

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,170
restocks mission and how can we be not

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,050
burning or throwing away a bunch of

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,570
organic material my name is Lucas I'm a

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,359
founder of a company called restock what

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,939
we do is we take byproducts of the

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,160
cannabis and hemp world and convert that

9
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,219
into sustainable products namely

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,828
paper-based packaging so we work with

11
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,929
some of the larger scale cultivators on

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,149
the planet and we give them the

13
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:43,590
opportunity to buy back their waste in

14
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:49,829
the form of packaging for their consumer

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:51,270
lines I mean I think it's everyone in

16
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,948
this world and in this room can

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,000
understand why it's important but I

18
00:00:52,948 --> 00:01:00,000
think from a larger perspective you know

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,679
the industry is coming out of never

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,469
being regulated ever it's coming out of

21
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,400
the black market and typically it's it's

22
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:07,319
been burned

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,400
you know let's hide the evidence kind of

24
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:13,289
mentality and we've been working on

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,600
these applications for the last four or

26
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,790
five years and I think you know combined

27
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,618
with innovation and regulation the

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,810
industry and the volumes that the

29
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:24,989
industry is putting out now are finally

30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:29,009
reaching a level that we can actually

31
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:31,828
make an impact on there's it's a

32
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,420
tremendously versatile plant it's it's

33
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:34,618
not just about packaging it's about

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,228
finding the most appropriate

35
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:39,030
applications for it in concert with new

36
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:42,118
innovation because I technology is here

37
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,978
today yeah yeah and there's all this new

38
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,290
innovation coming about with like

39
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,539
studying hemp as well as the waste

40
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,939
cannabis product so that's all it's all

41
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,950
really exciting Tom how about you

42
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:55,169
introduce yourself and tell us about bio

43
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,009
products Innovation Centre yeah thanks

44
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,228
Tom McGrath you see we we formed bio

45
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,519
products innovation Center last year so

46
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:05,640
it's about a year and a few months old

47
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:07,769
we loosely basis on an initiative that

48
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,679
we were working on with Jason for the

49
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:12,840
last several years on sort of a green

50
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,459
chemistry kind of approach

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,039
more from the industrial side out of

52
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:20,159
Ohio bio products innovation center and

53
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,560
we got some of the inspiration from them

54
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,889
and they're an academic based nonprofit

55
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,009
so we're a standalone non-profit based

56
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:31,018
out of La clean tech incubator and I'm

57
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:35,009
the chief sustainability officer for the

58
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:37,280
nonprofit and we we really look at the

59
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:40,259
conversations around the organics

60
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,539
circular organics economy and how do we

61
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:45,179
achieve that goal and how do we help to

62
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:48,359
move that conversation forward looking

63
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,980
at you know effecting change through the

64
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:56,190
the triple bottom-line guidelines of

65
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:59,340
benefit corporations or be corpse or you

66
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:01,439
know profits people plan it and the

67
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,598
argument is that you're gonna do better

68
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:07,949
for the planet and better for the people

69
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:10,768
by having profitable business around

70
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:12,659
around sustainability so the idea that

71
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,310
you're gonna make more money because

72
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,530
you're doing the right thing with with

73
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:20,459
this and so if we get into this you know

74
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,409
zero waste mentality the sooner we get

75
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,759
there the better we'll be so we also

76
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:26,759
look at it from the perspective of

77
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,048
energy so we look at sustainable we look

78
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:32,539
at through the lens of sustainable

79
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:34,349
energy into the water and soil

80
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:37,858
conversation so it's really sustainable

81
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:41,039
energy water and soil here we're talking

82
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,810
mostly about soil but you can't talk

83
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,078
about one without the other so they're

84
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:49,379
all connected so how do we make better

85
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:51,209
soil the food and the bio biological has

86
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,459
come from the soil and they will return

87
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,200
to the soil if we're doing it right

88
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:59,939
we're not making plastics that you use

89
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:02,129
once and go on the ocean so so those are

90
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,409
some of the main ideas you have to break

91
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:09,090
it down to reality and who's doing what

92
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:12,150
so we're we're we did some some

93
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,939
interesting work with doing admin on

94
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:18,060
some on some composting projects with

95
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,959
schools and communities here in LA to

96
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,509
help the city

97
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:26,199
public works go through you know

98
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:28,330
promoting compost and community scale

99
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,650
and it's just fascinating all the

100
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:31,000
different challenges that you come up

101
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,978
with on all these you know they're

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,110
growing food at the school they're using

103
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:37,060
compost for the fertilizer and you're

104
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,850
teaching you know how to like get this

105
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,589
circular organics economy evolving at

106
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,479
very small scales that but they're

107
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:46,448
significant and they helping to really

108
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:48,939
you know train the younger people we did

109
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:50,919
at an old-age home to in in a little

110
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:53,439
tokyo and they're doing Bokashi

111
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:55,959
a type of type of compost thing that you

112
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,089
know they can they can compost their

113
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:02,159
meat in addition to their fruits and

114
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:02,159
vegetables so it's it's an interesting

115
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:06,579
what they don't consume so it's it's

116
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:08,649
interesting there's so many different

117
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:11,680
layers of this so we can you know but

118
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:16,029
but and it goes to the big you know a

119
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,189
picture of - you know our industrial

120
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:20,319
life has led us to the worlds and

121
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:24,788
industry has led us to this place where

122
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:27,490
we take fossil fuels we take fossil you

123
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:30,550
know oil and natural gas coal oil and

124
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,879
natural gas and we we do things with

125
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,009
them

126
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,158
for industry and it's a sink it's a

127
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:38,529
linear conversation we extract 400

128
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:40,959
million year old hydrocarbons out of the

129
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:44,559
earth and we burn them turn them into

130
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,180
plastic any number of things we destroy

131
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,430
them and then we're destroying mother

132
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,259
nature and in the extraction part but

133
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,810
then in the use part we're putting that

134
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:55,360
carbon in the atmosphere so what doesn't

135
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,098
end up in the ocean as plastic ends up

136
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,419
in the atmosphere is carbon dioxide and

137
00:05:57,098 --> 00:06:04,839
that's what's choking us right now this

138
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:07,228
issue right so if we could so so we can

139
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:09,549
do the hydrocarbon management without

140
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:12,038
extracting it from that we can do four

141
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:16,240
month old or four year old hydrocarbons

142
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:18,939
from bio-based caballo methane but we

143
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,460
can we don't have to extract from 400

144
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:25,089
million years ago we can produce the bio

145
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:26,739
carbons that we need for our life here

146
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:29,049
for billions of people living on this

147
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,168
earth and we can do that in a way that's

148
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,460
sustainable more sustainable so let's

149
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:35,439
move in that direction

150
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:39,219
yeah and the conversations of recycling

151
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:41,920
and the conversations of hemp as a as an

152
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,790
important biological source for these

153
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,939
hydrocarbons

154
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:48,430
that's the these are the answers that

155
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,389
are that get you there can you explain

156
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,290
that a little bit more how do you

157
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:55,180
extract four year old hydrocarbons

158
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,069
through anaerobic digestion but you can

159
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,590
also do it through gasification if you

160
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:04,449
wanted to but essentially you you make a

161
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:07,659
soup you hire you put biologicals in

162
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:10,449
there from human waste to any kinds of

163
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,850
organic food trimmings if you if you

164
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:14,170
have a pure source of organics then

165
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,910
you're going to get three things out of

166
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,140
that you're going to get gases you're

167
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,350
gonna get liquids and they're gonna get

168
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:22,569
solids the gases are hydrocarbon gases

169
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,070
and the trick is the hydrogen we all

170
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:26,079
love hydrogen right it's number one it's

171
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:28,060
the first element right so we love

172
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:31,000
hydrogen we're here because the hydrogen

173
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:36,459
so the hydrogen you're getting the

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,959
hydrogen from the water the the bugs the

175
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:40,120
little microbes are consuming the

176
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,359
organics in the water and they're giving

177
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,509
you ch4 you know four H's and one C one

178
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,280
carbon four hydrogen's that is we're

179
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,920
lucky that we can do that that that's an

180
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:53,829
important element that we need access to

181
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,259
and it's and we're getting it almost for

182
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:57,789
free from these microbes we have a waste

183
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:59,740
product the quote unquote that we use

184
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,120
things we used to throw away now or

185
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,009
things that we can grow and the

186
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,199
byproducts of some of these we can

187
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:07,569
channel into the bio energy conversation

188
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,159
and this gets us out of the fossil fuel

189
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:11,379
conversation so it's a one-for-one

190
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,390
exchange for natural gas for fracking

191
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:17,409
for natural gas you can get that not

192
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:20,339
renewable natural gas or biomethane from

193
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,900
today so that's it 400 million years ago

194
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:25,569
four-year-old 40-year old tree whatever

195
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:27,669
it's gonna be you can get bio gases from

196
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:30,459
that and with the same hydrocarbon gases

197
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,990
you can make plastics you can we can

198
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:34,659
make the things that we use today that

199
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,310
we find convenient or helpful you know a

200
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:40,918
heart valve or something or you know

201
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:42,598
there are some you know good things for

202
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,278
if you you know if you need to use

203
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,009
plastics there are reasons to use it but

204
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,708
it could be bioplastic bio-based it

205
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:52,409
doesn't have to be from the fossil fuels

206
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:54,268
lucas instead of using this amazing

207
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:56,009
organic waste and then doing this whole

208
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:58,078
process and turning it into methane like

209
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:01,139
how like what have you been your

210
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:03,838
challenges in in diverting that waste

211
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,909
and keeping it away from like different

212
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,870
sorts of digestion like how is it how is

213
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:12,149
your work been challenging thus far with

214
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,909
working with waste cannabis I would say

215
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:16,528
that it's been challenging in first and

216
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:20,969
foremost in the lack of infrastructure

217
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:23,490
and processing here in this country it's

218
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:27,410
the the industry is just kind of coming

219
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:31,399
out of it's shell so to speak so to

220
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:35,370
process the organic waste into a useful

221
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:37,589
reusable sustainable material within a

222
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,440
reasonable distance has been a challenge

223
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:43,490
so we're actually breaking ground on one

224
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,180
of the first bio refineries in the state

225
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,860
at hopefully the end of this year to

226
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:55,099
create these regional circular economies

227
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,449
that Tom was hinting at California yeah

228
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,100
[Music]

229
00:09:56,448 --> 00:10:01,049
but yeah the infrastructure is not

230
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,990
really there once you travel more than a

231
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:07,649
hundred miles with it could be the most

232
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:11,669
sustainable material on earth the it

233
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:14,909
immediately degrades that value so I

234
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:17,189
think restock was a little bit ahead of

235
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:19,740
its time in the sense that the industry

236
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,360
wasn't producing as much material and

237
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:25,169
the infrastructure wasn't really in

238
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,850
place luckily now the demand is there

239
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:28,769
and certainly the industry is growing

240
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,570
there and now last piece of the puzzle

241
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:33,120
is the infrastructure in place to

242
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,800
process all these different inputs were

243
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,839
primarily focused on canvas and now

244
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,059
mmm-hmm so by infrastructure you just

245
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,930
mean the processing like the bio

246
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:45,958
refinery exactly processing with a

247
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:46,939
different with more than one end result

248
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,739
more than

249
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:52,400
one application whether it's textiles

250
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:55,070
whether it is paper-based packaging

251
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,029
whether it is bio plastics whether that

252
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:01,820
is some kind of alternative energy there

253
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:04,149
are a lot of different ways to do it and

254
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,980
people who are much smarter than me are

255
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:08,959
thankfully in charge of that we're just

256
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,480
really fortunate to have some partners

257
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,019
in that space who who've been the most

258
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,720
helpful allies for you the state has

259
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:19,840
been very encouraging I will say that

260
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,940
despite we were talking earlier about

261
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:27,740
just you know the the back and forth

262
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:30,260
between regulators and the bureaucracy

263
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,710
red tape surrounding that has been has

264
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:35,419
been wild but CalRecycle

265
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,639
you know the governor's office have have

266
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:39,319
been very encouraging they're just you

267
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,000
know like I was saying earlier you know

268
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,930
they have their their plates really full

269
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,600
with with how much they should be taxing

270
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:50,569
giving out all these licenses how are

271
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,629
they going to deal with the the influx

272
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,510
in cash all these businesses so a lot of

273
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:58,789
times waste management and recycling is

274
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:02,539
the basement level of what they're

275
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:04,250
trying to accomplish so they've been

276
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:07,480
very helpful and and partners like

277
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:09,110
circular systems which are the

278
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,210
manufacturing partners that were

279
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,250
building this biorefinery with have been

280
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,379
tremendous and they're focusing on

281
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,309
textiles they're focusing on textiles

282
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:18,649
yeah

283
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:20,539
we're you know developing a couple cool

284
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:22,730
projects with them they were just

285
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:25,669
awarded the HTM global agents of change

286
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:28,700
award for 2018 which is like the Nobel

287
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:31,519
Peace Prize for fashion which was a very

288
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,589
big deal for them they were just voting

289
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,889
with the money they came with yeah some

290
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:39,710
money as well they were voted Time

291
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:43,129
Magazine's top 10 smartest sustainable

292
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:45,680
ideas of 2018 so we're honored to be

293
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:50,059
working so closely with them but I think

294
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:51,979
you know innovation is is should be

295
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:55,459
driving regulation and that's a very

296
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:58,129
slippery slope especially given the way

297
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,740
that the exchange of information is so

298
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:02,028
fast nowadays it's very

299
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,459
difficult to stay ahead of something

300
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:06,049
like that but I think California is

301
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:08,750
doing a great job and they're doing what

302
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:10,669
they can to stay ahead of that but the

303
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,669
technology is here and it's it's

304
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:17,059
honestly a race against time as I'm sure

305
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:21,679
you guys you guys will agree yeah yeah

306
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:25,429
I'm curious if if any of you have any

307
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:27,019
like dream allies their dream partners

308
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,579
that like you have not gotten the chance

309
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:30,110
to work with and you feel like gosh if I

310
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:33,139
could just work with this organization

311
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,870
or this person like we could really get

312
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:38,689
some stuff done I would say like a

313
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:46,610
company like like Patagonia they're

314
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:48,110
there they're just the best right

315
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,379
exactly

316
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,120
they're they're just such a model for

317
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:55,639
for change and and and being radical but

318
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,139
being thoughtful and also understanding

319
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:02,179
their consumer and not not alienating

320
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:04,069
one demographic or another they you know

321
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:07,059
you can see almost anyone wearing

322
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:09,829
Patagonia and they feel good about it

323
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:11,838
that would be a dream from fur for us

324
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:16,099
maybe maybe they could be using some of

325
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:18,020
this paper right CRISPR labels yeah that

326
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,509
would be cool right are you doing the

327
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:23,720
textiles mm-hmm paper slut easier first

328
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:25,519
beginning a thank you yeah

329
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,440
just before I would answer that question

330
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,278
I just talked about like this concept of

331
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:35,450
up upcycling or you know finding value

332
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:37,700
in what used to be considered a waste or

333
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,230
a problem so you have it like for any

334
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,690
kind of business case you're just

335
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,950
looking at that like okay so you're

336
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,149
starting off with the negative and

337
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,680
turning into a positive you're already

338
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,570
ahead of all the other businesses that

339
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,000
are doing starting up at zero and going

340
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,890
to a positive so we're working with

341
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,379
something that's just a gimme I mean

342
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:56,990
there's so many great businesses that

343
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:59,419
come out of this so you it's it's

344
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,220
inspiring so there's uh there's you know

345
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:04,250
there's an awesome you know company at

346
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:07,070
LA CI that you know recycles bio

347
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,990
plastics so they have but you have to

348
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,120
separate it you have to get it separated

349
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,490
in order to do that and that becomes

350
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,509
part of the of the that's it's both

351
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,250
consumer

352
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:18,769
and ultimately corporate responsibility

353
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,320
for how why did you buy it but it's it's

354
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:23,899
it's it's a lot of it's a lot of change

355
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,300
that has to happen at once and it's hard

356
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:28,339
to orchestrate that so I just you know

357
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:30,289
it's it's really interesting to see all

358
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:33,709
these different people trying to develop

359
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:34,819
the modality for change we you know even

360
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:37,309
people are feeling that sense of urgency

361
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,870
in different ways but you know I think

362
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:42,109
everyone senses it that we have to

363
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:44,720
adjust you have to make adjustments you

364
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,730
know and so how does that work from you

365
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,850
know you know working with you know

366
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,320
innovative you know amazing innovators

367
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,870
you know Elon Musk doing you know

368
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,269
amazing you know getting us all into EVs

369
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,980
and you know do that but you look at the

370
00:15:56,269 --> 00:16:00,110
lifecycle analysis of a lithium battery

371
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,639
and say okay well if there's issues

372
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:05,000
there yet the things that we have to

373
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:06,110
work on and so I don't know it's not

374
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,909
nothing's gonna be perfect right away

375
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,039
but you know there's a lot of steps you

376
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:13,208
can take you know right away to create

377
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:15,649
businesses and Enterprise around

378
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:17,838
sustainability around bio products

379
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:19,190
around renewable energy around clean

380
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,800
water

381
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,680
I think Tesla would be a great dream

382
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:27,889
Ally yeah like if we could be like

383
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:31,370
making a hemp car you know like all the

384
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:33,620
maybe the inside could be have textiles

385
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:37,190
alternative leathers well I think it's

386
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:40,159
it's places like like Lacey are very

387
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:43,399
important I think that you know a clean

388
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:48,350
tech incubator is is something you don't

389
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:50,629
see a lot of it's it's fantastic we're

390
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,220
honored to be a to be a part of it and

391
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:54,500
to be working out of there is very

392
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,980
inspirational motivational but you know

393
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,379
from a day-to-day perspective and level

394
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,819
like it's it's kind of a lot of doom and

395
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:04,130
gloom when you look at the current state

396
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:05,990
of things so it is hard to maybe stay

397
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,799
motivated a lot when you're looking at

398
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:11,750
all this going on in in in the air

399
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:14,449
quality in Mexico and all of the burning

400
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:17,919
of trash in India and it's it's all

401
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:21,048
happening around us so I think using

402
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,209
incubators like like Lacey and having

403
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:24,859
the young minds who are taking some

404
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,750
accountability and some responsibility

405
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:30,990
for what's been done to the planet

406
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,119
continues to be done is so rad to see I

407
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:36,450
just wanted to go down one little

408
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:39,299
channel and then I let go but I spent a

409
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:41,370
lot of cycles and working in Jamaica and

410
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,529
they've had an illegal you know

411
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:47,369
Jamaican was something big in the 80s I

412
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:49,109
remember but we you know it's we've been

413
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:52,409
down there and they're there organics to

414
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:54,629
waste 85 to 90 percent of what goes into

415
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:58,440
the is not it's not a LAN throw it's

416
00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:02,040
it's dumped in Kingston 80 to 90 percent

417
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:07,289
of that is organics so that is an

418
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:09,629
attractive target for for doing a better

419
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:10,889
you know you set up a Murph 90 percent

420
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:19,050
of your activity that you're going to be

421
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:20,700
doing recycling a sorting Center you're

422
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:22,680
gonna focus on the organics because

423
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,640
that's 90 percent of what is going in

424
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:30,720
there so so we had a two-part program

425
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,630
one was to to to to to attack the

426
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,819
problem of the waste and that's a big

427
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,170
problem there are fires oh they're

428
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,250
always burning things and things are

429
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,019
happening they are a bad air quality

430
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,640
very dangerous for the people that live

431
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:44,369
right around there

432
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,920
and then and then the next is is they

433
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:49,500
have lost it had a sugar industry that

434
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,090
has lost their business to larger

435
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,880
companies like Brazil that can produce

436
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:56,970
sugar less expensively because the high

437
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:00,930
cost of energy so what we can grow

438
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:03,059
grasses or you know like hemp like king

439
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,820
grasses or you know other we can we can

440
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:08,789
grow material that can then be digested

441
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:11,339
and produce the renewable natural gas to

442
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:12,930
replace the diesel that they currently

443
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:15,779
run their whole island on diesel

444
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:18,720
electricity so there's these are like

445
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,069
you know island why island solutions and

446
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,870
islands are really great because it's

447
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:23,909
such a metaphor for our little blue

448
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:26,939
marble right I mean is you know

449
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:29,610
everything has to be managed you know so

450
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:33,630
you can do that circular organics

451
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:36,299
economy at in island nations I think

452
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:40,160
with a really good very positive

453
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:42,649
outcomes and clear need and desire to

454
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,050
have a more sustainable system because

455
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:47,540
they they they pay have such incredibly

456
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:49,970
high energy cost so and that affects

457
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:51,859
everyone from you know schools to you

458
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,750
know hospitals they have a problem with

459
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:55,789
their electricity and then these

460
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,930
hurricanes come in soap were to reco all

461
00:19:55,789 --> 00:20:00,470
the work that you know people been doing

462
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:02,870
down there so obviously at that but this

463
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:05,390
circular circular organics model you

464
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:07,939
know I feel I feel very lucky to be in

465
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,860
California because it seems like there's

466
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,680
so much that's possible and people are

467
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:14,539
so interested in finding new solutions

468
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,460
whereas I know in a lot of places like

469
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:18,529
Mexico and and other small countries

470
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,809
it's like there's just waste everywhere

471
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:22,819
like there's there just are no systems

472
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:25,339
but here we have like such an

473
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:27,079
opportunity to to actually figure out

474
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:28,909
what to do with all of this stuff well I

475
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:32,119
think you're 100% right about about the

476
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,040
the island nations actually needing to

477
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:36,409
manage it even even more so their

478
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:38,509
resources are extremely finite and so

479
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,100
micromanaging that is like of the utmost

480
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:42,049
importance I would love to pick your

481
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:43,549
brain about that that work you did there

482
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:49,159
as a whole and they could do and

483
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:50,930
textiles yeah yeah and solving the

484
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,090
problem the waste issue doesn't just

485
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,070
always come down to the biomaterials

486
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:56,689
either right there's there's a systemic

487
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:59,089
there's there's systemic change that

488
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,400
needs to happen and there's the the

489
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:03,169
issues that affect one country are going

490
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,769
to be different than how where they come

491
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,910
from or how they affect another country

492
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:10,099
what we have here when we look at our

493
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:12,019
waste system and you're asking who would

494
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:13,819
you like to work with I don't have a

495
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:15,379
particular business I want to work with

496
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:16,789
I want it I want to make sure everyone's

497
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,530
at the table so that we can have

498
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:20,450
conversations to try to figure out what

499
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,099
the solutions are particular to the

500
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,740
waste issue that we might be having and

501
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:27,379
those solutions are not just one-off

502
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,849
trade it for this you know let's get rid

503
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,670
of plastic and trade it for a bioplastic

504
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:33,169
it's it's not that there's so much more

505
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,570
to it than that there's a complexity

506
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:37,160
there of we have to get to a point where

507
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:38,720
we are reducing our consumption we have

508
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,670
to get to a point where we're not

509
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,460
allowing corporations to tell us that we

510
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,930
have to consume in order to live it's

511
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,590
hard to have any business with the

512
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,210
business plan

513
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:48,799
yeah then actually feel good about it

514
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,640
like I don't really want you to buy this

515
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,869
but I want you to buy the model but but

516
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,490
I think there's

517
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:58,639
then we'll talk about scalability if

518
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:02,180
there's if we reduce the amount of need

519
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,380
and we have you know we have enough of

520
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,330
these businesses coming out and saying

521
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,980
okay to be able to trade this product

522
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:09,349
for this product or be able to produce

523
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,670
here I think I think we have solutions

524
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:12,619
within there I don't think that it's

525
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,850
gonna put people out of business unless

526
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:16,549
they're trying to get their product into

527
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:19,969
Walmart or something but when you look

528
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:21,889
at other countries sometimes their waste

529
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,360
issue is not about oh they have this

530
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,470
waste now and we've got to deal with

531
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:29,899
their waste because they have a lot of

532
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,549
poly you know pet water bottles number

533
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,590
one water bottles if does not use

534
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:36,049
terminology I guess we have number one

535
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:38,509
water bottles and we have a lot of film

536
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:39,859
plastic and we have a lot of chip bags

537
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:41,089
and granola bars and these sort of

538
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,819
wrappers and they can't do anything and

539
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:46,519
they never had this stuff twenty ten

540
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:48,679
years ago but have it now so that the

541
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,720
problem is the waste no the problem is

542
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:53,090
that we're going into their country

543
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,380
they're colonizing their country they're

544
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:58,039
taking over their land they're saying

545
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:00,320
you cannot you can't grow your own crop

546
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:02,269
anymore because we're gonna take this

547
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,730
amount of land here and we're gonna put

548
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:06,799
a palm oil company on it because we need

549
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:09,019
palm oil and the products that we buy

550
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,029
and our soaps and our conditioners in

551
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:12,650
our food whatever it might be we need

552
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:14,240
that palm oil but that palm oil is gonna

553
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,970
be wrapped in eco-friendly wrapping so

554
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,880
don't worry about it so if we we have

555
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,529
this so they take over the land they you

556
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,920
have communities who are living in that

557
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:23,839
land

558
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,289
all throughout who are now having to be

559
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:29,389
forced into one small area they can't

560
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:32,480
grow their own food anymore so they

561
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:34,670
don't have a they can't you know

562
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,430
subsists on what they used to subsist on

563
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,440
and they need to to go and work the the

564
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,060
palm oil plantation to be able to make

565
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,700
the money to be able to go buy the food

566
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:45,440
because they can't grow their food now

567
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,289
they're saying don't worry about it

568
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,090
we're gonna set up some markets within

569
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:52,309
this little neighborhood that you've now

570
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:54,199
been shoved into and at these little

571
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:57,980
markets as little markets there kiosks

572
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:00,440
there kiosks with diabetes causing food

573
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,839
options that come in single-use

574
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,490
disposable product that they can't do

575
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,529
anything with they don't have the

576
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,990
infrastructure for landfills they don't

577
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,649
have the

578
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:13,259
not really going to get recycled

579
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:14,490
incineration is in my opinion out of the

580
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:16,980
question and I know there might be

581
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,049
people here that disagree with me but

582
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,450
it's extremely expensive and that and

583
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:24,000
the the talks the the amount of toxicity

584
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,620
build-up goes within the community the

585
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,849
community pays for that eventually

586
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,649
besides the fact that it's more

587
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:32,639
expensive and it creates more co2 than

588
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:34,470
coal and nuclear but I mean you can look

589
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,179
up Gaia if you have any questions Global

590
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:38,460
Alliance for incinerator alternatives

591
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,519
but we won't get into a deep dive on

592
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,558
that so so now they're told you have

593
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,879
food you can buy all this product they

594
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:46,319
eat that product they have the trash

595
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,059
what do you do with it

596
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,428
they're gonna burn it they're gonna open

597
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:52,500
pit burn it because you don't like trash

598
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:54,840
on the streets here in Los Angeles why

599
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,390
do we think that people in countries in

600
00:24:54,839 --> 00:25:00,119
Central America and Africa want trash on

601
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:03,450
their streets they don't it's a really

602
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:05,669
good point because with the with palm

603
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:08,970
oil because that was the solution that

604
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:11,580
in America we thought oh boy we're gonna

605
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,740
have like sustainable fuel and it's

606
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:17,039
gonna be biodiesel and we're gonna make

607
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:19,620
it from palm oil and then this huge what

608
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,139
they call a carbon bomb was offset from

609
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:24,058
deforesting so much of the Philippines

610
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,040
and like there's I think there's still

611
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:29,970
fires burning underground like in there

612
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:32,869
Pete Oh Indonesia Indonesia and it's

613
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:35,940
just such a good story of warning of

614
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:38,609
before you start running off with with a

615
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:41,730
new sustainable idea like make sure you

616
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:44,089
go all the way through the process and

617
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:48,480
look at all of the consequences because

618
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:51,779
now Indonesia like has a lot of problems

619
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,130
and we have colonized them and lost so

620
00:25:51,779 --> 00:26:00,069
many trees and

621
00:25:54,130 --> 00:26:02,740
it's just that process yeah you use the

622
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:07,899
word underdeveloped but he use that as a

623
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:10,890
verb we underdeveloped that area through

624
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:14,548
this prosecution so it's an active verb

625
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:14,549
it's not in magic

626
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:26,509
