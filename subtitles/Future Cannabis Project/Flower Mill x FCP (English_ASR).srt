00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
[Music]

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:09,660
foreign

3
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:09,660
[Music]

4
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:21,778
first time in L.A and we were like he

5
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:24,118
needs to experience the valley and uh

6
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:27,140
it's actually quite cool right now so

7
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:30,379
you're not experiencing Peak heat Valley

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:34,079
but uh

9
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:37,859
yeah no this is good so all right so we

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,899
have the flour mill sfv we have The Man

11
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,479
Behind The Flower Mill so you want to

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,520
give us uh some backstory on how this

13
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,319
all came about yeah well it's funny like

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,859
we were talking earlier it was 2019

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,480
canacon Detroit and I had met what are

16
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,479
who are now my partners that's

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:02,399
wow is that like a military uh age 47

18
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:04,679
twin rotors they used to uh they it was

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,780
an Army transport but now it's used for

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,200
putting out fires I used to work on

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,640
h-46s the C Knight which is a smaller

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,420
version

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,819
all right so so yeah it's 2019 I'm in

24
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,359
Detroit canacon I'm managing some grows

25
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:24,658
at the time and uh just kind of entering

26
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:28,379
into the Cannabis Market publicly and uh

27
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,600
I had met John and Aaron and Jason and

28
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,219
those are the actual guys that invented

29
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,679
it three Engineers that started off

30
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,618
making aftermarket automotive car parts

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,420
for Mazda Miatas and so they were

32
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:42,478
tinkering at the end after the work with

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,400
the machines they are okay

34
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,859
um not quite as heavy as maybe uh we are

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,960
but uh they definitely you know

36
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,959
appreciate the plant and you know

37
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,859
um well they're good great guys they're

38
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,239
engineers and so they tackled the issue

39
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:58,618
with the equipment that they had in the

40
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,560
back and it started off with a little

41
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,060
shark fin and that fin would just get

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,340
worn down all the way until it was

43
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,680
completely flat like this and it became

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,280
a Milling screen or a Milling plate like

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,640
I like to call it and that

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:18,539
is how we ended up with this

47
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:20,639
and as it went down we found that we

48
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,620
started off with just 10 flutes in our

49
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,559
rotor and now we have 20 because we were

50
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,080
getting pancakes so uh

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,420
you know we kept on designing and

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,000
Engineering it and at the time it was

53
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:36,780
Royal Health and the product was called

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,539
the crown and uh they had gotten two

55
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,400
prototypes out of 30. they had called me

56
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,439
back about a year later and said I don't

57
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,019
know if you'll remember me but we met

58
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,759
you at Detroit cannacon and I said it's

59
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,840
in my hand right now I've been waiting

60
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,000
for your call

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,300
flew out literally I think a week later

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,360
and made them a deal we became Partners

63
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,719
within about 10 days hiked Camelback

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,900
Mountain Barefoot together and the rest

65
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:07,199
is kind of History you know from then we

66
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,080
renamed it Flour Mill and worked on the

67
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:13,259
design and I kind of helped build the

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,300
company around a product and build a

69
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:18,299
brand within that and together we had

70
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,459
taken it to to this level and now we've

71
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,180
got five Partners total and it's me and

72
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,739
Q and Aaron and Jason and uh

73
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,900
that's

74
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,580
you know and John in Canada so we're all

75
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,519
over two guys in Arizona one in Canada

76
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,840
and in Detroit Chicago yeah

77
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,000
yeah without them none of this is

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,860
possible so I'm just the guy that gets

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,900
to do all the fun stuff out here and so

80
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,659
there are three sizes right so you wanna

81
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,080
there's actually two sizes we have the

82
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:45,079
mini Mill

83
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:50,298
which is pretty cool

84
00:03:53,719 --> 00:04:00,539
so the magnets were a big part of it

85
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,819
we've got the standard size which is

86
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:04,919
another

87
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:06,060
version of the flower Mill that is all

88
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,919
built in and doesn't have any

89
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,598
interchangeable parts

90
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,818
except for this ring that you can put a

91
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,619
Keith catch into if you wanted to

92
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,359
this is the one that we like this is

93
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,000
personally what I use every day

94
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:23,359
most people really like the premium

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,358
version because you can customize it

96
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,918
and swap out these screens for different

97
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,418
sizes

98
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,639
and break it down any way that you want

99
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:34,620
while you're doing it for Backwoods or

100
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,500
for Vaping you might want to go a little

101
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,360
bit finer and some people some of the

102
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,160
professional rollers actually do a blend

103
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,379
of

104
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,380
two-thirds with a smaller one and one

105
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:48,839
third of the of the batch with a larger

106
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:50,279
one so that enables people to customize

107
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,239
it based on their cure based on what

108
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,599
they're going to be using the product

109
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,220
for does it have a smoother burn well

110
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,620
yeah it burns more evenly and

111
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,960
consistently and the difference is that

112
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:05,418
because of the way that it's being

113
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,418
processed you're no longer

114
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:09,959
grinding you're Milling so all the

115
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:11,819
trichomes and cannabinoids are still

116
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,459
stuck to the vegetable

117
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,779
so it it burns differently it lasts

118
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:17,579
longer

119
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:19,799
um it it gets you a little bit more

120
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:21,060
lifted and elevated because all the good

121
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,860
stuff is still attached to the

122
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,839
vegetables

123
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,979
um

124
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,399
completely breaks down so it's easy for

125
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:28,399
cleaning

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,478
I'm just the industrial design

127
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,839
the engineers those guys you know it's

128
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,699
just clean and tight yeah yep how did

129
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,859
you come up with the the actual part

130
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,900
that grinded what did you do the mill so

131
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,699
this is a rotor a rotor flutes yeah yeah

132
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:47,939
the flutes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and

133
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,259
this was just uh that's a process yeah

134
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:51,538
that's it well it goes back to like

135
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,919
Milling food a Milling grains and and

136
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:54,360
all that stuff so this has been this

137
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,219
technology has been around a long time

138
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,979
we just haven't been applying it to the

139
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,660
to our industry yeah I recognize the

140
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:03,180
different size holes from meat grinders

141
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,800
yeah I've never seen a great Crossover

142
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,139
with food actually I don't mean to bring

143
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,978
up the word granny because this is a

144
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,740
meal

145
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:12,360
and uh for the patents we did get our

146
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,860
patent on this thing so that's why we've

147
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,419
been kind of quiet about coming out so

148
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,800
strong but you know now that we're

149
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:18,299
covered and protected because we know

150
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,800
this is probably the the way that you're

151
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,978
going to want to be processing your

152
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,379
cannabis personally uh going forward so

153
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:27,300
um

154
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:28,740
magnetic aspect is what separated us

155
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,419
from being able to get our patent when

156
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,460
we were denied and we had to appeal it

157
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:34,439
they were saying the pepper mill and a

158
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,599
lot of you're mentioning food and you

159
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:39,180
know kitchen utensils so this is really

160
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,860
close to a kitchen item and we had to

161
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,160
say well there's nothing quite like this

162
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,038
and so the magnets along with these is

163
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,620
really what enabled us to protect you

164
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,259
just holds it together right yeah

165
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,939
um so still that's really a cool part of

166
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,280
it the other thing is a quarter turn off

167
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,918
it's double threaded so look how quickly

168
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,500
you can separate the housing from the

169
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,939
base so most of them use 180 degrees and

170
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,220
you're spinning and spinning this is

171
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,139
double threaded so it's very easy to get

172
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,580
on and off that is something that I

173
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,340
think you just noticed after you start

174
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:13,978
using it for a while but it's it's meant

175
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:16,318
to be more efficient increase the

176
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:18,360
quality results the idea is to make a

177
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,780
more efficient process it's a lot faster

178
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,180
you can do 3.5 grams at one time and

179
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:26,159
probably less than five seconds so we

180
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,680
can do a demonstration like that and the

181
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,660
end result is lighter and fluffier and

182
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,160
it's easier to roll it's easier to

183
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,319
manipulate and play with but it's also

184
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,840
it comes alive which we can show on

185
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,979
video which is why this is so cool

186
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,299
because I'm doing this over the phone a

187
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:41,279
lot of the time or in places where I

188
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,079
can't do it with product and show you

189
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,939
and give you an actual demo and that's

190
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,219
where the magic happens so I think

191
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:48,959
equally as important you want to walk us

192
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,919
through the lineup of weed that you

193
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:55,038
brought yeah sure most important that's

194
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,839
one of the reasons we're here I guess

195
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,879
this is a Pillow Talk number one from

196
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:03,119
Tang Farms with Moscow seeds and

197
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,098
genetics and this is really very special

198
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,220
this is from afino hunt that we did down

199
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:09,839
in Oklahoma with Ben grieve and Aaron

200
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,780
and we are Partners in a new company

201
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,698
called analytics that smells unreal

202
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:17,638
photos yeah that it smells better than

203
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,680
anything else on the table at the moment

204
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,439
I'm not trying to insult anybody else's

205
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,918
bud so that's this is really nice which

206
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:29,779
we can sample a little bit later we have

207
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:29,779
uh the elevated genetics Tiki Tom

208
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,759
this is just another gray one

209
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:38,099
and these are the genetics that you know

210
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:41,899
there there are seeds

211
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,899
uh from Moscow usually

212
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,120
and then uh

213
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,860
there's this one some Raspberry Pi it's

214
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,159
not these are not my favorite sample

215
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,159
jars for this reason yeah but you can

216
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,778
get it raspberry pie is very good this

217
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,759
is actually one that

218
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:01,500
um is one of my personal favorites I

219
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,500
think this is this is going to be

220
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,839
absolutely phenomenal divulge the origin

221
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,200
of the genetics yes we do this is a

222
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,120
Moscow and tisky I actually sell a bunch

223
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,640
of their stuff right this one's Tiki

224
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,879
right or one of them is Tiki Moscow and

225
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:21,419
Tiki crosses yep

226
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:23,100
um what's the origin of tiki that's

227
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:25,199
another breeder he's another breeder out

228
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,420
of Michigan and mosque is out of Ohio so

229
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,820
those are Midwest so guys you're from

230
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:31,819
outside right yeah yeah yeah yeah

231
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,740
um so yeah uh then we got like some

232
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,420
Chris Moscow my other partner at Hill

233
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,080
Street genetics

234
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,838
um

235
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,700
and Hill Street companies this is the

236
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,620
Jamaican blue that I've smoked most

237
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:50,278
people down with but I've never sold any

238
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,959
of it so this is a really beautiful from

239
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,879
Lamb's bread from Jamaica from 40 years

240
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,099
ago we've brought up washed it back

241
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,080
cleaned it out and brought it back with

242
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,180
some there's some grape got in there

243
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,620
this is Superman ice cream so we've

244
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:05,278
created a new one that is just

245
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,440
phenomenal so that's a fun one maybe I

246
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,580
and I can smoke some yes yes we'll be

247
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,800
doing that and then we got some

248
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,420
strawberries you said that what you what

249
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,579
was the Rohan story

250
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:17,159
yeah well it was fun you know we heard

251
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,660
from Rohan and he had you know row had

252
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,338
contacted me and went down to Miami to

253
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:23,458
see him and we were able to actually

254
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,019
share the Jamaican blue and there were

255
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,239
some guys from Jamaica there and I think

256
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,740
Mike James is there and you you know

257
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,620
they're mentioning how you could taste

258
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,778
the tarwar and the and the red clay in

259
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,519
the soil which I thought was so cool you

260
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:36,838
know to to I've never been to Jamaica

261
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,039
and they said You're Nobody Until you

262
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,360
know in this industry until you've been

263
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:40,980
there so

264
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,000
um thank God I'm stampster damn and

265
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,800
Spain under my belt in the last couple

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,078
of months but I think Jamaica and all

267
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:49,500
these other places are next so it was

268
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:52,319
really cool to connect through the plant

269
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,940
um with that family and have such a

270
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,040
great experience with it so that was

271
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,620
pretty neat because of the and where we

272
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,778
connected uh with Lion order was really

273
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,720
on the fact that Jamaican blue coffee

274
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:06,838
you know the Jamaican Marley coffee they

275
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,000
they Mill it so their process for making

276
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,500
their coffee is very similar so we

277
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,240
connect it instantly on the flour mill

278
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,740
that's amazing and then genetics were

279
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,899
just a fun thing so we've actually taken

280
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,180
this Strawberry Cough

281
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:20,639
and mixed it with the Jamaican blue to

282
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:22,500
give Roe exactly what he was looking for

283
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,639
which is the blend of these two so

284
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,639
that'll be out soon

285
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:30,359
well that's up to him

286
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,819
[Laughter]

287
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,440
so we like to work with people like that

288
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,720
and you know there's a little bit of

289
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,940
spillover and other things but you know

290
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,778
well let's get to it all right

291
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,839
um but I thought you brought some

292
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:44,578
generous here too so yeah I I'm sorry

293
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,040
we're gonna smoke all this tomorrow so

294
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,719
I'm totally

295
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,519
all right to try what you brought with

296
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,839
you well here's some strawberry so this

297
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,759
is the difference I'm just going to lay

298
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,279
all these in here see that stem

299
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,899
yep we're gonna leave it there typically

300
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:00,179
you dick your hands and you'd mess it up

301
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,860
I'm gonna put uh

302
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,958
it doesn't get grounded in there does it

303
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,519
well it doesn't have to that's up to me

304
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,559
that's up to me I mean I don't think

305
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,519
they will use the word ground milled in

306
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,059
there

307
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:14,278
I gotta stop saying and ground don't

308
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:16,259
call it a grinder so look at those stems

309
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:18,120
are right there on top without the phone

310
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,620
oh my God then I didn't go all the way I

311
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,799
went most of the way then I just take my

312
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,299
finger take the stems out like that that

313
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,740
took like less than a half seconds oh

314
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:27,979
yes that's what I'm saying and that was

315
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,740
you know and then look at the end result

316
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,000
oh my God

317
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,959
there's the other stuff I have never

318
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,958
seen anything like this

319
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,600
burnt fewer calories yeah yeah

320
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,219
it is happier it's it's lighter fluffier

321
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,480
you can shape it you can see how it's a

322
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,639
little bit alive it looks perfectly

323
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,159
rolled down right now and what what

324
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,079
gradation of holes this one is our

325
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,278
standard and so we have all these

326
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:54,838
different ones and we can run some

327
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,179
through and change some different sizes

328
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:00,360
to to show you the difference and this

329
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:01,620
is just is this a standard no uh yeah it

330
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,600
is because that's the one that it comes

331
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,220
with naturally so when you change them

332
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,920
you unscrew the thing and then you put

333
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,660
the new one on yeah yep as of now we're

334
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:10,740
always looking to tweak things and make

335
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:12,299
it better

336
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,820
um all right you want me to roll one

337
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,979
that'd be great and then let's do the

338
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,320
Jamaican too just because this is we're

339
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,899
here together and you know um let me

340
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,760
just plug Cali High episode 61 it's

341
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,759
called Jamaica it's about the time I

342
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,980
went to Jamaica these so this these

343
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,439
genetics the the Lamb's Brad came from

344
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,839
Jamaica in 1980 one year before I was

345
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,519
born and these guys brought back that we

346
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,899
actually have the photos of the seeds in

347
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,578
the field on the mountain with the

348
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,778
plants and the whole thing and then it

349
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:41,879
was a couple guys working for the

350
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:43,559
military came back back and brought them

351
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:45,600
back and we've had them ever since so we

352
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,518
actually popped these seeds do we have

353
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,180
any filters here I have some in the

354
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,159
house I don't have any

355
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:55,500
let me run I'm a Midwest guy we smoke

356
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,919
like cigarette style joints with no

357
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,919
filters

358
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:01,740
um

359
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,480
since we've got a moment you know one of

360
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,159
the cool things about flour Mills that

361
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,360
we were able to approach people that I

362
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,120
don't think you otherwise would be able

363
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,459
to and we went with

364
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,399
um you know zigzag my father smoked

365
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:16,199
zigzag oranges my whole life so for me

366
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,559
they're iconic and legendary in their

367
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,680
own right my my childhood but uh to be

368
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,819
able to do a collaboration with zigzag

369
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,979
and have it be the first collab with

370
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,079
zigzag was really a beautiful thing this

371
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,420
is phenomenal so we made a new logo

372
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,159
together and this is a really cool thing

373
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,078
that you can see out they just got their

374
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,360
shipment so I know that they're selling

375
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,159
really well right now and then who else

376
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,500
were you excited to do a collaboration

377
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,778

388
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,919

00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,719
very special this is something that I

398
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,679
want to experience with you guys

399
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,300
together

400
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,299
here let's make this easier on you

401
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,220
so normally we have Otis here who's like

402
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,500
the house professional roller and uh

403
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,540
it's nice to just have him yeah yeah

404
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,179
yeah do all the rolling our rollers will

405
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:59,519

406
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:02,819
set up for hollow flowers so we'll have

407
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,500
Hapa and Bruno Luxe rolls and

408
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,940
that's usually who it takes care of this

409
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,480
for me too

410
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:12,720
some of the best in the world I think

411
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,360
that's nice well done

412
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,519
well done look at shenzo it was speed

413
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,259
beautiful that was just I mean together

414
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:24,000
I think we make a good team absolutely

415
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:24,000
bro I'm looking for a job podcast

416
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,698
you can find Kelly High on the future

417
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:34,379
cannabis project though too so I'll show

418
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:37,099
you how it breaks apart so we can do one

419
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,100
that's smaller

420
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:42,659
they've added these washers in to the

421
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,299
premium because so many people are just

422
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:47,039
spinning these without product in it and

423
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:49,139
it's created some metal on metal issues

424
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,759
and so we're getting a lot of comments

425
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,959
about that but it's very small it's less

426
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,759
than one percent of people are actually

427
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,619
having an issue with it but so we've put

428
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,259
these extra rings in there just to kind

429
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,600
of help people that it's kind of like a

430
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:02,639
fidget people are really playing with

431
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,240
these often and they like it in their

432
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,919
hands it's uh

433
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,298
what's what's the feedback on kind of

434
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,100
like

435
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:13,318
what scenarios people I mean you

436
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,178
mentioned it before but kind of like I

437
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:18,298
love this size

438
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:20,339
hole for this purpose and that size for

439
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:22,019
that I was just in Europe with uh and I

440
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:24,119
ran into stores and pickle you know the

441
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:25,798
volcano and I I have a volcano I have a

442
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,619
couple of them I think that's a perfect

443
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:31,918
product for the smaller holes

444
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:34,079
the consistency and the mighty is really

445
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,120
good for that too but I think that you

446
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,579
know when you're vaping especially on

447
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,739
the go that it gives you

448
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:43,500
your your Smoky vaping more surface area

449
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,839
at once and it's all consistent so

450
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,980
there's not left with bigger chunks or

451
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,889
something like that that is trying to be

452
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,969
processed

453
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,969
[Music]

454
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,280
here in case you guys

455
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:10,500
I got some orange soda here which is

456
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,380
some of my personal favorites this is

457
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,200
really delicious this is all grown in

458
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:20,460
soil with with no uh

459
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,679
no nutrients no Toppers no teas just are

460
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,298
organic patent-pending soil

461
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,780
and uh

462
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:26,779
water

463
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,440
yes please

464
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,058
I think we should spark one of those up

465
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,919
yes that's true so why don't you uh

466
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:38,879
where's the oh wait sorry I missed it

467
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,360
it's okay

468
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,620
yeah it's fast

469
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:47,279
so that little stuff that was in here

470
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:49,739
again laying on top right there

471
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,500
that is phenomenal

472
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,660
because I spent half my time pulling out

473
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,579
these sounds before I even put it in my

474
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:01,380
grinder not associated with the mill wow

475
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:03,720
so look at the difference between these

476
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,700
two so that's the finer one right the

477
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,808
smaller holes

478
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,808
[Music]

479
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,179
so some people like to mix these

480
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:17,460
together

481
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:19,380
and also what is so cool about the flour

482
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,440
mill is that afterwards you can't help

483
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,360
the terpenes just they liven up they

484
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,120
wake up and so they don't get stuck to

485
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:29,399
the mill right you're not creating that

486
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,979
is probably grinding it together so yeah

487
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,000
I mean check the nose on that that you

488
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,440
wouldn't have thought you wouldn't have

489
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,058
got that same

490
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,980
hit out of the uh of the jar

491
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:43,639
true hey there

492
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,640
all right

493
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:51,000
I think we're all three-part Italian at

494
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:54,720
least here I got Italian and German

495
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,900

I think that pillow talk because that's

525
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,419
um also the pillow talk was grown the

526
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,279
most amazing smell that I said okay yes

527
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:26,100
that is it pillow talk okay it wasn't

528
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,500
the Kiki was the pillow talk yeah

529
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:31,199
and chenzo what was your uh Lamb's bread

530
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,259
story my Lamb's red story okay so I went

531
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,940
to Jamaica in 75 the year after I

532
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:38,038
graduated high school because my brother

533
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,659
told me there was rastafines at smoked

534
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:41,460
weed there and that was kind of their

535
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,880
religion so I bought myself a ticket

536
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,860
after selling a bunch of Colombian and I

537
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,740
got in the grill

538
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:51,839
and met a Rastafarian named reford ward

539
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,659
he turned me on to reggae for the first

540
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,720
time also we were sitting in my Tenon of

541
00:21:54,659 --> 00:22:00,720
Sands of uh in Negril Yacht Club under a

542
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,839
palm tree and

543
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,179
um he told me that

544
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,819
Lamb's bread is actually a technique you

545
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,840
cut off the uh the top eight inches of a

546
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:11,939
plant

547
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,980
right after it starts to Bud and stick

548
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,440
it back in the ground in Jamaica this

549
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,839
the muddy soil acts like

550
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:23,240
um well we would put our clones in and

551
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:23,240
it takes root and becomes an amazing

552
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,658
yeah and that's what they called Lamb's

553
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:37,379
bread

554
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:39,299
so years after that people came up with

555
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,919
a strand they called Lamb's red that

556
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:42,538
smells great what's this one this is the

557
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:46,559
pillow talk

558
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:48,900
that's uh Moscow and Tang farms and

559
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:53,480
House of Kush and all that oh Tang has

560
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,480
been and uh Ben and Aaron and Brent yep

561
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,659
and so we've created a new company

562
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:01,859
called analytics and we have that's a

563
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:04,740
whole nother conversation for another

564
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:07,199
day yeah

565
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,659
he's no longer with amazing Ben is with

566
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,640
us so it enables us to do things that he

567
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,260
wasn't otherwise able to do so I think

568
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,419
that it's going to be a lot of fun he

569
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,980
just got back from Oklahoma so Ben did

570
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,038
growing in soil he did the final hunt

571
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,880
yes so and Coco we've got down there I

572
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:23,640
think

573
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,100
um heated soil so this came from soil

574
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,400
and so he just did these um he had about

575
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:30,480
250 that he popped and this is one of

576
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,360
the best ones that we came back with so

577
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,839
let's uh give this again yeah great

578
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:40,918

632
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,720
this this is probably one of my favorite

633
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,000
genetics that has not been just yet

634

637
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:13,200
these are actually moscases I don't even

638
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:16,400
know that that's so I can ask Rick uh

639
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,400
it's what cross yeah

640
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,380
but also to get back to Aaron and John

641
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,600
and Jason are the engineers those are

642
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,900
the guys that crank out all the cats all

643
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:32,699
the everything floral earthy and a

644
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:36,059
little bit fruity

645
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:39,380
but like uh underlying

646
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:39,379
what kind of fruit would that be

647
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:46,798
maybe uh somewhere this is where we need

648
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,599
to give give is like my voice in terms

649
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,819
of uh

650
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,558
I'm like it tastes good or like I'll be

651
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:55,740
like it tastes fruity but like he'll be

652
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:58,200
he'll wax poetic about right

653
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,819
the gagiers shout out to Gabe and we

654
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,159
wish he was here we're going to try to

655
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:03,418
do our best to describe this but it is

656
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,059
super smooth

657
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:07,919
it is not tasty

658
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:10,079
yeah

659
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,559
and it has many elements it's complex

660
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:15,240
right but it works together

661
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,859
yes they are and we care about it we pay

662
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,298
attention to our terpene profiles and

663
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:20,579
the caminoids and the blends of those

664
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:23,759
sometimes you have these high thcs and

665
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:25,500
that really takes away from helping your

666
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,319
pain receptors and actually getting the

667
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,058
full benefit of of the Entourage of the

668
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,740
entire plant when you're growing it

669
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:32,940
specifically for one cannabinoids and

670
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,380
there's hundreds and hundreds and

671
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,159
hundreds that you do and don't know

672
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:40,140
about well you're you're in some ways

673
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:42,480
overlapping the positive that you can

674
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,220
get so yeah that's very good what did

675
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,778
you think of the Formaggio

676
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,579
I only had a couple of hits but it

677
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:49,440
started this conversation off right yeah

678
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:50,879
you know that's good I feel very

679
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,419
comfortable those are growing over there

680
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,419
yeah

681
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:04,080
I I um I was so fortunate during the re

682
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:07,940
I tried to keep the strain alive during

683
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:11,278
the cold winter and I had two mothers

684
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,500
and I was like oh I'm gonna have better

685
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:16,440
take some cuttings so I took some

686
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,259
cuttings and then like a week later

687
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,480
the two mothers got powdery mildew and

688
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:24,599
I've never had because I had to I don't

689
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,519
have the right stuff and I was moving

690
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:28,678
the plants in and out the change of

691
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:31,558
temperature and the dampness because of

692
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:35,159
all the rain gave them powdery mildews

693
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:37,500
never had on a cannabis plant ever but

694
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:41,760
uh so I I chopped them down and threw

695
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:44,880
them away but taking the the Clones

696
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,919
too much four of which I kept which are

697
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,480
right there and

698
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,580
um before putting them out there I'm

699
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,099
keeping him in veg but I have a little

700
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:54,298
tray of clones right there which I

701
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:57,119
should probably put in in a few minutes

702
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:58,980
oh I see yeah yeah beautiful I'm trying

703
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,959
to keep my strain alive bro so how long

704
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,278
have you been gardening

705
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,278
um

706
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:08,400
well straight for about five years six

707
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:11,460
years now and I grew a successful crop

708
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,159
back in like 19.

709
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:18,360
80

710
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:20,340

just east of the uh

712
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:27,000
405 where Gaspard gas bar de Portola was

713

716
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,140
so we could roll one of these up too and

717

00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:20,519
and had a great time and I shared the

760
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:24,079
Raspberry Pi we shot a video of him

761
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,079
smoking it and uh

762
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:33,659
I'm smoking on this

763
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:38,240
brass Berry right here delicious rice

764
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:41,039
Berry don't forget the pier Berry

765
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,159
love you brother

766
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,240
you know raspberry pies rasp our ASP and

767
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,399
I think a lot of people say Raz

768
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,839
raspberry because of this industry is

769
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:50,939
probably part to blame because the

770
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:54,418
r-a-z-z and the flavors of gummies and

771
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:56,880
the different products right yeah so I'm

772
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:59,220
actually with Roe in Miami before this

773
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,340
meeting in Detroit and we're laughing so

774
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,839
hard about Raspberry Pi so when I tell

775
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:05,639
them the story while we're in Detroit I

776
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,839
telling Dairy during that story and he

777
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,259
goes rasp

778
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:12,298
berry pie my friend's recording it

779
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:15,058
um and now like a week later after that

780
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:17,038
there's a music a song made from that uh

781
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,200
smoking that joint Raspberry Pi from the

782
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,460
audio recording of the video and so it's

783
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,679
evolved in this thing and I think

784
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:26,038
raspberry prey it warrants that and

785
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,440
there's the Club remix yeah it is I got

786
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:30,058
a remix before I got here just before I

787
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,980
got to California

788
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:33,599
um so it's really you know it's cool to

789
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:37,740
be able to work with those people I love

790
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:39,778
music so you know you play uh no but um

[Music]

796
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:04,320
so it's really cool that this this

797
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:06,359
industry and these products and the

798
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,678
genetics that we bring together can

799
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,139
cross over into the mainstream like

800
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,840
sports and you get to meet people that

801
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,220
you like and might want to work with and

802
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:15,778
so like being able to work with zigzag

00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,720
questions it will leave off the Tyson

820
00:33:55,859 --> 00:34:01,398
because that's better for the the future

821
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,399
cannabis project Neil deGrasse

822
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:05,519

824
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,719

Motown and you know

880
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:36,838
if I DJ it's a commitment to like

881
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:39,539
getting back into it because I don't

882
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,279
want to like if I do it I'm gonna like

883
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:43,800
start spending time at home going

884
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,540
through music and I know it's like it's

885
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,940
like something that if you enjoy it it's

886
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:50,279
like an art and if you enjoy making art

887
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,858
why not make it good you know I enjoy it

888
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,359
I just have no time for it that's why I

889
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:56,759
throw the playlist together or I just

890
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:59,639
need other people to DJ what about

891
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,339
do you ever use like

892
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:06,659
turned or simulated turntable stuff with

893
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:09,358
like Reverb and so I had I I used I used

894
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:12,480
to use turntables and then I started

895
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:15,480
using Ableton and so I do you know like

896
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:19,699
so many people DJ with like the what is

897
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,699
it tractor and what's the other one

898
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:37,319
so you said it it's very strong right

899
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:40,379
what is it ta what would you guess as

900
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,599
the THC contents of that product

901
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:47,280
um not as high as I you would think from

902
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:50,880
the effect because of the terpenes it's

903
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,380
special it says 19 and yeah I've never I

904
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,420
don't walk around with coas I'm not

905

trying to prove a point uh you know with

906
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,980
those I know that what's amazing is I

907
00:37:56,338 --> 00:38:02,578

908
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:05,400
you can't get this yeah

909
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:08,820
the quality of the high it's not the the

910
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,400
number of percentage of THC it's you

911
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:14,640
know and it's yeah you're right it's a

912
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,800
Entourage of different terbians

963
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:07,618

Video I'll put it together I'll send it

965
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:12,420
to you okay but um

966
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:15,118
so I love being able to work with people

967
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,559
that this that gives us the ability

968
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,960
um because we're not a grinder not

969
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,338
everybody we don't have to do collabs

970
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,838
and Partnerships so we're very selective

971
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:23,880
about who we want to work with and we

972
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:26,039
pay attention to your history your

973
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,140
involvement who you are character is

974
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:29,519
important you know we come from bringing

975
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:31,980
morals ethics and values and business

976
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,179
Acumen to cannabis these things cost

977
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,400
more to make we're not trying to make

978
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:36,960
the prices High because we think they're

979
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,240
worth more and that you should pay more

980
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,980
it's because that quarter turn threading

981
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:43,379
right there that costs an extra oh it's

982
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,539
like almost two dollars just for that

983
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,039
extra double threading right yeah so

984
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:50,338
that adds up with the quality of the

985
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:52,380
magnets all this stuff and so you know

986
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:53,880
and we know what we've created so it's

987
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,220
important we you know what you've

988
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,079
created and how important and it is to

989

1020
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,618
okay so let's uh

1021
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:31,980
did we smoke everything nope nope that's

1022
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:35,160
the orange the orange okay we have not

1023
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:38,099
smoked the orange folks

1024
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:40,379
we are going to smoking and it's

1025
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:43,320
orange soda this is Chris wasco's stuff

1026
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:46,019
so Chris Wasco lives in Michigan as well

1027
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:49,619
and he's got just a beautiful history of

1028
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:52,500
no he's um he's related he's he's got a

1029
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:54,599
partner Andy and they got uh spot up in

1030
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,119
Lapeer Michigan and Vassar a couple

1031
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,700
licenses up there and Chris has put

1032
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,140
together over with his family it was

1033
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:03,960
like with his grandfather starting

1034
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:06,539
fishing you know 30 years ago teaching

1035
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,119
him how to make soil and so he's really

1036
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:11,400
mastered the technique of living soil

1037
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,780
and that's where I feel these terpenes

1038
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,000
really come out and express themselves

1039
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,280
he's gotten 4.2

1040
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,280
um back on coas for terp profiles on

1041
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,460
these uh it's just a very clean and he

1042
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,720
he's a plant person turkey is really

1043
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,818
high yeah no typically you're between

1044
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:27,838
one and two percent I mean I think if

1045
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:29,099
you're getting between two and three

1046
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,358
you're doing really good and that's like

1047
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:32,700
a nice place to be people are hitting

1048
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,739
between three and four but they're using

1049
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:36,598
a lot of things to Pump It Up

1050
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:38,459
um we don't this is how would you do

1051
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:40,440
like that's not even my thing I'm not

1052
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,760
the the expert on that so I won't go

1053
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,980
into it that's why we have Ben that's

1054
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,660
why I got Ben as a partner yeah

1055
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,699
um Ben grieve and Aaron and you know

1056
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:49,379
we've we've got some

1057
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:50,759
pretty solid people that that's what

1058
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:54,000
they do what is it what were you saying

1059
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:56,160
the number is 4.2 percent which is high

1060
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,900
and that's great and it's from water and

1061
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:58,739
dirt nothing else it's a hot and cold

1062
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,139
mix

1063
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:04,199
and uh I believe that's what you're

1064
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:06,480
licked down I do yeah yeah that's

1065
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:07,919
beautiful and you don't need a pen or a

1066
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,960
thing you don't go Hey where's the poker

1067
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,960
you're you're good this is beautiful

1068
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,519
well let's give you take to dry on that

1069
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:19,380
okay yeah see if you can taste those

1070
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,838
terpenes right there

1071
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,640
oh my God and it's soda so why we call

1072
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:26,460
it soda it kind of fizzes on the side of

1073
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:28,318
your mouth and you'll so the soda line

1074
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,940
is what Chris has come up with and he's

1075
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:31,800
there he's responsible for the Jamaican

1076
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,720
blue and the lemon haze I have Lemon

1077
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,339
Haze with me which is one of my personal

1078
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:36,899
favorites

1079
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:39,179
um

1080
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:41,460
and uh so the combination of having

1081
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:43,858
people that have dedicated their lives

1082
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,960
to these plants and

1083
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:49,338
we're able to kind of bring these out

1084
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,338
into the mainstream

1085
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:52,280
and there's

1086
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:58,980
it has like a deep OG underneath the

1087
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:01,618
orange somewhere down there

1088
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:06,440
it seems like this is a this is this is

1089
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:06,440
like really worth investing in yeah

1090
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,460
and smoking

1091
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,700
yeah so we license our genetics out

1092
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,619
and um really so you just don't make

1093
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:18,899
flour mill you know there's a company we

1094
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:20,880
invested in houses more yeah so we're

1095
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,380
Partners in House of Kush and you know

1096
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,000
some of the newer genetics and designer

1097
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,318
genetics that are coming out that are

1098
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,119
people looking forward to stay ahead of

1099
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:29,880
the curve but also with that have a

1100
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,858
story and have a legacy and have

1101
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,240
um you know balance between what we're

1102
00:45:31,858 --> 00:45:34,799
looking for today but we're not trying

1103
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:36,118
to play these High T games and all that

1104
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,640
stuff some of this stuff does test out

1105
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:41,880
High the cream sodas are 32 this is

1106
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,078
between 26 and 30 all day they yield

1107
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,300
everything's been tested for commercial

1108
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:46,980
viability

1109
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,660
well

1110
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:52,619
there you go if you need me to further

1111
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:55,379
test out any I'll be here excellent

1112
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:57,240
yeah now your opinion is valued oh yeah

1113
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,519
these are amazing

1114
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:00,959
and so they're all unique questions that

1115
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,659
we get to do this all over again

1116
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,818
tomorrow night good are you coming I'll

1117
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:07,139
be there bro

1118
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:10,139
um

1119
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:13,799
so this leads me to think that Michigan

1120
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:15,598
has the the kind like Cali like

1121
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,160
California there is some serious Talent

1122
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,240
you got heavyweight heads out there and

1123
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:20,639
they're actually the ones that are

1124
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:21,899
growing lion odor stuff in Michigan and

1125
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:24,118
they've got some they started with their

1126
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,039
sunshine and you got trick trick and

1127
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:28,440
Willie J peso with their giraffe head

1128
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:30,358
and Shout out also to riddles J.O with

1129
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,460
his runts and Skittles um we've been

1130
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:33,900
hanging out a lot the last year and I

1131
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,940
really think his genetics are some of

1132
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,039
the best he found Girl Scout cookies and

1133
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:41,579
some of the originals that we all know

1134
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:43,318
today under all these Brands so we are

1135
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:45,480
able to work with some of these

1136
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:48,000
kind of you know to me they're the

1137
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,380
Godfathers of the genetics and there's

1138
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,300
other people that just been gifted stuff

1139
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,920
the right way and you know there's plant

1140
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,539
people over people people and some of

1141
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,519
these Growers you're not going to run

1142
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:57,779
into them at a show you got to know them

1143
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:59,818
or be introduced to them because you're

1144
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,140
doing something different and I think it

1145
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:03,300
comes down to the business side of

1146
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:04,980
things uh if you can make enable people

1147
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,140
to do what they're good at eliminate all

1148
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,519
the marketing of the accounting and the

1149
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:11,098
stuff that gives them headaches build a

1150
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:13,019
team around them I think that's part of

1151
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:14,519
what is making a difference is you know

1152
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:15,900
we're not just here to sell shit we want

1153
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:17,358
to help here's added circle like these

1154
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,500
are things we know from having other

1155
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:21,779
businesses in our lives before we got to

1156
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,219

1163
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:39,899
avionics stagnation

1164
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:41,939
um so you know I see people that have

1165
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,559
talent in this in this space in this

1166
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,960
industry but sometimes they're getting

1167
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:48,480
wiped out by bigger people consuming

1168
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,059
them or getting in the contracts or not

1169
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,039
protecting themselves or following

1170
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:54,719
through and and not doing what they say

1171
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,880
they're going to do and collecting money

1172

00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:20,639
could see it in my head

1184
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,920
um I was up on the hill behind my house

1185
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,480

public and that's a fun one

1258
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:16,679
72.

1259
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,260
yeah

1260
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:21,259
that was 10th grade

1261
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:27,179
and the guy that was the hash connect

1262
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:30,239
was lived above my avocado tree

1263
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:33,799
live above your avocado to cool

1264
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:33,799
so he also came with avocados

1265
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:38,150
[Laughter]

1266
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:46,440
fresh made tortilla chips straight from

1267
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,339
the other oh yeah it was a house avocado

1268
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,920
tree

1269
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:53,039
when it had avocados they were really

1270
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,780
good they didn't have them every year

1271
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:56,639
yeah I'd like to have a good avocado

1272
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:59,160
tree yeah you have to have a pollinator

1273
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,139
around if it's a female I think it's a

1274
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:05,058
female and male thing

1275
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:05,058

1276
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:08,719
like uh

1277
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:16,079
I think you graphed on certain

1278
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:18,900
of a cut like because if if you have a

1279
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:21,000
good uh if you eat a good avocado and

1280
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,099
you plant that seed it's not going to be

1281
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,619
the same no

1282
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:28,640
so you need if if you nail down

1283
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:34,440
something you like like Haas or whatever

1284
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:36,539

1285
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:40,318
um and and then and then

1286
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:42,480
um put on to like a different avocado's

1287

00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:41,838
yeah we haven't even smoked it yet yeah

1311
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:52,759
there is no too high unless you like

1312
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,760
are too high

1313
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:56,720
this should take us somewhere

1314
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:04,318
this has the most amazing automatic

1315
00:54:00,659 --> 00:54:06,358
removal of stems I've ever seen

1316
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:08,338
that's a good one

1317
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:10,500
uh all right here we go I can't believe

1318
00:54:08,338 --> 00:54:12,179
how this happens so I'm going on those

1319
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,739
finer holes because a lot of

1320
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:17,659
professional rollers and people that

1321
00:54:13,739 --> 00:54:17,659
will really want the smaller grain then

1322
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:25,440
look at his hands

1323
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:28,440
five seconds

1324
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:31,800
it takes a little bit longer with the

1325
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,240
um with the smaller holes and the more

1326
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,400
coarse it is I mean you're basically one

1327
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:37,818
turn that was probably six percent but

1328
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,818
look at that

1329
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,559
wow

1330
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:51,239
um

1331
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:54,480
yeah a regular grinder does it comes out

1332
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:57,419
smelling nice like this kind of

1333
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,719
I think it wakes up the flower and it It

1334
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:03,119
prepares it for its purpose and that to

1335
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:05,039
me is what's so special about this thing

1336
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,140
the end result

1337
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:09,000
it's fun to talk about all that and you

1338
00:55:07,139 --> 00:55:12,739
know the process is cool what it's doing

1339
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,739
and how it's doing it but this is

1340
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,519
just awesome

1341
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:24,480
are you excited to smoke your next joint

1342
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:27,240
I am very excited this this smells like

1343
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,219
um could be the best one so far that's

1344
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:32,459
awesome that makes me feel good

1345
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:34,739
yeah because you don't know it's been

1346
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:37,440
hyping up the most all night seriously

1347
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:40,919
this one's and it's available we have it

1348
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:44,159
nobody else has that it's a place it's

1349
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,260
very whiny very white it like red winey

1350
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:47,960
berry

1351
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:51,839
like a

1352
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:56,838
Chianti maybe or maybe more I could look

1353
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:56,838
out the lineage it's fruity deep fruity

1354
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:04,818
shenzo I think after you roll this we

1355
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:04,818
should have one more beer

1356
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:09,500
I think so and then call it a night

1357
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:23,220
so the lineage on that Jamaican blue

1358
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,899
uh it's an Indica dominant hybrid strain

1359
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:27,838
created through Crossing an old favorite

1360
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:30,599
DJ shorts original blueberry crossed

1361
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:32,940
with Jamaican land race BX then crossed

1362
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:35,579
with Superman ice cream which is Grape

1363
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:39,179
God and it is your favorite and Infamous

1364
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:41,640
Cataract Kush BX Jamaican blue Blends

1365
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:44,039
floral notes with sweet tropical Citrus

1366
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:46,440
flowers finishing with delicious Berry

1367
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:48,179
tartness that will Linger on the tongue

1368
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,920
the aroma consists of a citrus and

1369
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:51,480
tropical floral overtone that is

1370
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,059
slightly Berry and sweet

1371
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,500
Jamaican blue experience has a nice

1372
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:57,480
lifting effect that comes from its

1373
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:00,260
Jamaican lineage that Fades into a

1374
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:04,019
relaxing and slightly sedative

1375
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:07,140
long lasting high coming from us Indica

1376
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:09,599
ancestors you'll feel a euphoric

1377
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:12,000
cerebral onset that will fill you with a

1378
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,980
pure happiness Vibe pushing out any

1379
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,559
negative or racy thoughts

1380
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:18,480
a light tingly body high comes next

1381
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,579
creeping up on you before you suddenly

1382
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,000
take hold or pulling you on a state of

1383
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:26,460
relaxation the 13 the terpene in

1384
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,858
combination with this moderate THC level

1385
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:33,059
which I said is about 19 percent

1386
00:57:28,858 --> 00:57:34,858
uh comes from some CBG as a bonus it

1387
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:37,500
gives Jamaican blue on experience that

1388
00:57:34,858 --> 00:57:38,639
is entirely unique

1389
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,800
yeah

1390
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:43,618
I give out a lot of stuff that's high in

1391
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:46,019
CBG yeah hoping that people play with it

1392
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:47,760
we have CBG gummies lit labs are doing

1393
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:49,318
those they're just pure CBG gummies

1394
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,380
which is good I've been doing I have

1395
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:55,800
like some dabs I'm doing dabbing like

1396
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:58,680
like terp pens and just dabbing pure CBG

1397
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:01,559
I have psoriatic arthritis how do you

1398
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:04,259
get it pure just order the API you know

1399
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:08,059
what's the effect instant and it's great

1400
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:09,980
I feel pure CBG CBG

1401
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:13,980
yeah

1402
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:15,659
CBD in my gummies especially no I

1403
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,679
haven't had any lately because I've been

1404
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:20,098
just

1405
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:21,779
making Edibles for my own stash but all

1406
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:25,440
right let's light this thing up what is

1407
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:28,339
it called raspberry raspberry pie don't

1408
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,338
call it raspberry

1409
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:34,920
so I can see how that one based on the

1410
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,539
finer grind and why people like that

1411
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,639
that's very much like a cigarette on the

1412
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:41,460
end of it you know

1413
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:45,199
the way that Lit Up is no I'm the actual

1414
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:45,199
hot yeah like that was noticeable

1415
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,559
because I don't use that one

1416
00:58:49,338 --> 00:58:55,078
we should just say where's Camera two

1417
00:58:52,219 --> 00:58:56,639
look at it on camera too the lighting of

1418
00:58:55,079 --> 00:59:00,298
that you might have to make a commercial

1419
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:03,838
out of that so one of these got it

1420
00:59:00,298 --> 00:59:06,630
we can zoom in on the software

1421
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:08,639
here here I can fix it

1422
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:11,119
[Music]

1423
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:11,118
filter

1424
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,260
astray

1425
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:21,919
just have to re-roll it a little bit

1426
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,920
tighter

1427
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:29,760
fit it in let's see where we cut in some

1428
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:32,400
dubby music it's plain while chenza's

1429
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,000
repairing fixing not only do I roll but

1430
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:38,700
I repair everything

1431
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:42,780
I stand by my work I will I will repair

1432
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:44,759
it some raspberry pie

1433
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:46,740
I have a song for it that we could I

1434
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:50,160
could play actually yeah yeah right

1435
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:51,659
let's just uh play the actual song while

1436
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:53,039
we're smoking it oh here it is on my

1437
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:54,960
phone right there this is the remix

1438
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:57,500
though I like the first one better but

1439
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,500
let's see

1440
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:05,179
uh

1441
01:00:02,179 --> 01:00:05,179
what

1442
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:12,558
okay that was great that's what I charge

1443
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:12,558
for

1444
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,920
all right here we

1445
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:25,500
says someone downloaded the audio and

1446
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,818
then put music through it yeah I want to

1447
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:30,179
play the original one first because this

1448
01:00:26,818 --> 01:00:32,940
one's it's just Epic

1449
01:00:30,179 --> 01:00:37,259
oh you know what I should do hold on I

1450
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:39,960
gotta show you the the video of

1451
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:41,400
the moment right because that's even

1452
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,400
cooler you can see how this evolved

1453
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:46,318
naturally

1454
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:48,420
okay this is the wrong size filter is

1455
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:49,759
what it is but you know what it's gonna

1456
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:52,559
be okay

1457
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,240
just be careful yeah yeah and then we

1458
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,440

1459
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:58,199
terpenes

1460
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,539
and that last one was a very I call it

1461
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:03,118
an Oiler

1462
01:01:00,539 --> 01:01:06,719
it was the orange one orange soda orange

1463
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:09,019
soda that was yeah it was so dense

1464
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:13,439

1465
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:14,818

1466
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,200

1473
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:33,500
about a week later I'll wait for the

1474
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:33,500
plane to fly over

1475
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,539
[Music]

01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:42,920

1477
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:42,920

1478
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:07,469
[Music]

1479
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:12,318
this is Marcus Christie in Michigan

01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:19,329
[Music]

1481
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:35,759
I think I would probably grind my not in

1482
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:38,779
such a fine way

1483
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,780
the next one up

1484
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:46,920
so yeah that's the original and then he

1485
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:49,318
sent me the remix and I was like it was

1486
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:52,139
very cool yeah so then he added some

1487
01:02:49,318 --> 01:02:53,940
poor shit yeah that's a so that came

1488
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:55,739
from the night that was sharing so this

1489
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:58,380
has already become just kind of a

1490
01:02:55,739 --> 01:03:00,798
legendary genetic for me it's been and

1491
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,798
it's good

1492
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:06,720
it is like a Raspberry Pi

1493
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:06,719
experience

1494
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:12,920
like crushed but very like

1495
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:19,680
[Music]

my drive home tonight it's gonna be very

1497
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:27,558
slow on the 405 I'll be like right hand

1498
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,559
lane in the Prius going 50.

1499
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:32,338
foreign

1500
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:50,539
I had other phenotypes of the cross

1501
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:50,539
between the Afghan land race and the um

1502
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:58,260
OG some of them took after the Afghan

1503
01:03:54,059 --> 01:04:00,780
had Cedar like smelling big buds you

1504
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:04,200
know donkey dick types but the one that

1505
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:08,099
took after the OG had like nuggets you

1506
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:10,798
know spaced nicely you know yeah are you

1507
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:12,838
excited for the caterpillars this year I

1508
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:14,699
already caught one at the base of one of

1509
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:16,739
the plants out there it was there and

1510
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:18,358
then I lifted up something that I was

1511
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:19,979
looking for Phoenix you know bugs for

1512
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:23,159
Phoenix we have a

1513
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:25,980
a Leopard Gecko and it needs insects I

1514
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:27,239
when I don't buy crickets or I'll find

1515
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,519
them around here and it's been too cold

1516
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:31,798
for crickets I have to sometimes I have

1517
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:34,259
to get what's underneath the pots you

1518
01:04:31,798 --> 01:04:38,219
know I lift up a pot and there's pill

1519
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:39,299
bugs or uh worms or stuff so yeah that's

1520
01:04:38,219 --> 01:04:43,699
a constant

1521
01:04:39,298 --> 01:04:48,298
battle Yeah so but I found oh um

1522
01:04:43,699 --> 01:04:50,519
caterpillar under there I killed it

1523
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:53,818
um sorry Mr caterpillar may you be

1524
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:56,460
reborn in a better existence next time

1525
01:04:53,818 --> 01:04:58,500
but I didn't want to take a chance in it

1526
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:02,240
spreading I didn't know what it was and

1527
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:02,239
didn't know so many of them

1528
01:05:02,338 --> 01:05:06,599
like I have a Jared

1529
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:11,639
and I just drop them in there and

1530
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:14,338
there's like

1531
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:15,779
well you see 50 of them in there the net

1532
01:05:14,338 --> 01:05:18,298
is there because one year I was

1533
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:19,880
completely devastated by caterpillars

1534
01:05:18,298 --> 01:05:22,980
you know I had grown some kind of

1535
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,579
Hawaiians strain that

1536
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:27,380
um

1537
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:27,380
wasn't used to California Heat

1538
01:05:27,659 --> 01:05:30,798
and it was weak

1539
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:36,420
in I don't know maybe I didn't cover it

1540
01:05:35,338 --> 01:05:39,558
so

1541
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:39,559
it's cold

1542
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,900
well why don't we wrap up okay but yes I

1543
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:49,578
do agree with you it's uh it's chilly

1544
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:52,019
it's a Brisk night in the valley

1545
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:55,680
but these are the most amazing machines

1546
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:57,780
for for getting your cannabis into a

1547
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:00,838
a rule

1548
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:04,140
she's never going back to Christ here's

1549
01:06:00,838 --> 01:06:07,078
the zigzag one this is really cool

1550
01:06:04,139 --> 01:06:11,358
Flour Mill we'll leave you with one

1551
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:11,359
he's gonna be a Miller yeah I

1552
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:16,199
you know I think

1553
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:18,660
it's so amazing is the top of the

1554
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:21,798
rotor yeah the rotor

1555
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:21,798
those little flutes

1556
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:28,140
that is me okay so you got it so it

1557
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:31,019
doesn't do metal on metal friction yep

1558
01:06:28,139 --> 01:06:31,618
because of the

1559
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:34,798
um

1560
01:06:31,619 --> 01:06:36,539
washers yeah yeah yeah they're working

1561
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:37,679
you know it's it's you know when you

1562
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:39,539
create things that are this it's

1563
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:41,879
Innovative in a very saturated market

1564
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:43,700
and you know you're going to take on all

1565
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:46,680
kinds of stuff but yeah you know it's

1566
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:48,058
I've had incredible success on it I

1567
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:49,379
personally haven't had any issues I've

1568
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:51,798
never seen anything

1569
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:54,180
like transform that

1570
01:06:51,798 --> 01:06:57,900
butt into

1571
01:06:54,179 --> 01:07:00,480
drawing them not Grant okay milled yeah

1572
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:02,639
it's a different Final End Result right

1573
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,740
it's sold

1574
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:06,598
yeah that's the whole point

1575
01:07:04,739 --> 01:07:08,519
I think it treats the product with

1576
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:10,260
respect

1577
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:14,099
your flower's happy or you're happier

1578
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:15,780

1579
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:18,900
