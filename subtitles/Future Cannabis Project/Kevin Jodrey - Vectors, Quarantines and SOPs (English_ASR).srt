1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,599
so if I chemically treat I can I can

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,780
control most all pathogen problems but

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,550
cannabis is so regulated that it creates

4
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:14,070
the situation where you have to be hyper

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,139
clean to the degree that like when I

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,910
show up in jobs and I'm like like you're

7
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:19,800
gonna dress me and they go no no we know

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,070
who you are I'm like I'm a fucking

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,219
vector it doesn't matter who I am like

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,469
where's my contamination shit and I

11
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,149
think that people are not aware of the

12
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:32,089
fact that you know like the aphid right

13
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,738
now that's our special guest of the day

14
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:38,550
the multiplication rate of that thing is

15
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,750
unbelievable and in the aphid family

16
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:42,628
even though we're working with a

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,640
different type of rude aphids changed

18
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:46,679
French wine forever

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,070
it wiped out an industry they had to go

20
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,359
to Americans rootstock which they didn't

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,759
want to do because they had to admit

22
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,539
that it the the pathogen came from

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,399
America in like 1870 so it comes over

24
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:01,770
smashes the whole French industry they

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,618
have to go to American rootstock because

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,439
they had resistant varieties it changed

27
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:09,569
an entire industry because no one could

28
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,728
deal with the problem and it still is

29
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,188
that issue where you still can't use

30
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:17,340
specific grapes and specific regions

31
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:19,408
because it the moisture level in the

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,350
soil just allows them to flourish and

33
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:26,460
the plants and I'm resistant so we bring

34
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:28,769
in this aphid issue and it is deadly in

35
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:31,289
an operation if you're not having a

36
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:33,629
containment that's incredible and I

37
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,490
don't think anybody really designed the

38
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:37,289
operations to have that level of

39
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:39,899
sterility I think one of the the

40
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,200
cleanest socks I know is the is it's an

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,520
indoor but it's a wonder Brack stop down

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,469
in Long Beach where you have to go

43
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,478
through basically you know blow blow

44
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:50,658
tubes to go in so it's almost like

45
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,399
you're going into a like a virology lab

46
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:55,259
but that's the only way you're gonna be

47
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,540
able to run it and I think that that's

48
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,359
the the change is that on these massive

49
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,118
mega operations we have to have to

50
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,340
rethink the whole workflow containment

51
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,699
who goes where who's allowed to be where

52
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,128
and and how you absolutely keep yourself

53
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,649
protected because once you get an

54
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:15,090
infestation and canopy that dense this

55
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,829
then you can do you can't bring in any

56
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,128
kind of predation that's going to

57
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:25,019
out-compete the reproduction rate of any

58
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:27,870
of these predatory problems for us so

59
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:30,090
actually and I think they drinks the

60
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,180
world loud to use like I mean these

61
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,069
fucking aphids like some thrive on some

62
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,010
of the shit we used to try to get rid of

63
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:40,259
them I mean I don't know what it is but

64
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:42,090
I don't want to know any names so these

65
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,729
products but there's only a few of them

66
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,469
you can use in the late flower and I

67
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,780
mean it's at the point where I think

68
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:51,389
Dave if it's like I said just drink that

69
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,930
shit some of them die but they multiply

70
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:56,310
so fucking fast that it just it blows

71
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:01,349
the doors off mm-hm

72
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:20,669
anything yeah yeah exactly I was just

73
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:31,168
gonna say that yeah yeah do you want to

74
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:33,349
talk about just in case you want to talk

75
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,819
about some of the stuff you've seen in

76
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:37,649
operations you've consulted on and kind

77
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:39,750
of some standard operating procedures

78
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,379
and best practices for bringing things

79
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:47,579
and from the outside which typically is

80
00:03:42,378 --> 00:03:49,768
clones and cuttings well yeah I mean you

81
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,569
know there has to be a quarantine a

82
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,760
portion of the facility when you're

83
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:55,439
bringing in stuff in for intake and then

84
00:03:53,759 --> 00:04:00,000
you got to be able to look stuff over

85
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:02,219
pretty good and and whether you're using

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,439
you know I just posted a little story of

87
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:07,098
a little microscope thing that isn't a

88
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:10,139
fancy microscope like Scott use it but

89
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:13,138
it cooks up to your computer or you can

90
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,659
use like a jewelers type of microscope

91
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:18,359
handheld deal that you go around and a

92
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:19,889
lot of the PCAs and regular AG use these

93
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,408
things and you just look at the leaves

94
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,389
and so you know there's just a lot of

95
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:26,230
looking at these clones when you're

96
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,810
bringing them in because

97
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,640
you know every nursery has a little

98
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,470
something it's just at scale there's

99
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,919
just no getting around some of that

100
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:38,230
stuff and so no matter how hard they try

101
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,080
you have to try just as hard and not you

102
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,810
know kind of waver on thinking that

103
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,099
things are clean when they're not

104
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,709
because you can look at 30 different

105
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,050
leaves all around all these trays and it

106
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:53,769
takes you know one leaf to finally find

107
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,840
something and most people up on five and

108
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:57,759
so you know it's a tremendous amount of

109
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,359
looking at things paying attention to

110
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,789
that stuff and it's not necessarily my

111
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,030
you know my my original deal but I've

112
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,200
just been a lot of it lately and so

113
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:09,879
communicating with a lot of the farms

114
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,589
and people that I work with even up in

115
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,240
Humboldt it's not just in you know a

116
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:16,209
valley type of thing it happens to be

117
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,240
all over like I'm talking and if you

118
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:21,399
talk to people you know at least when I

119
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,319
talk to them one-on-one you know people

120
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,389
are say straight up yeah I'm fucking

121
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,430
having problems this this situation this

122
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:29,589
year some people blame it on the big

123
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,449
rains we had two years ago that all of a

124
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:33,039
sudden you know brought in all the

125
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,810
aphids after the drought you know

126
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,480
there's all these folklore going around

127
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,310
or whatever but nevertheless they're

128
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,319
here and they multiply fast and it

129
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,959
doesn't matter where you are in cannabis

130
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,899
this state that state up north down

131
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,759
south or whatever it's a problem for a

132
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:52,209
lot of people and it comes back also to

133
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,370
the viroid you know it's you know the

134
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:57,909
viroid for the plants whatever you want

135
00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:00,250
to call it the dotting is a huge problem

136
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,590
too and I think that's a big vector for

137
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,779
bugs it's a generational thing it's been

138
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:06,789
transferred around a lot of the people

139
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:09,149
that found this viroid don't want to say

140
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,260
they're saved bugs don't transmit this

141
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:13,719
shit but there's a few people that I

142
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:16,029
really believe in online and stuff that

143
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,070
I follow and they're deep into bugs and

144
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:23,139
they say that it does and I kind of

145
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:25,269
agree with them because people have to

146
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,870
realize a quarantine too right is you're

147
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:30,549
not just quarantine against a sow that I

148
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,620
like I'll give a plug to the company I

149
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,329
like that I mean I wish they gave me the

150
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,090
microscope but I love my little Dynalite

151
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:39,219
because it plugs into my pad and it

152
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:40,039
gives me a big screen to look at and

153
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,570
it's really a fish

154
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,819
but that doesn't let me look at viral

155
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:45,409
issues and so the problem that people

156
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:48,500
would bring new plants and is it's not

157
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,630
just pathogens that are going to

158
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,480
multiply in that form but it's in viral

159
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:56,480
and once you bring that plant into the

160
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,689
facility anything you cut or touch and

161
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,280
transfer SAP you can transfer that and

162
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:04,310
now you start to move it into your

163
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:07,309
populations and by the time you realize

164
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:11,000
what you've done you reduce your overall

165
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,949
Terp levels potency levels resistance

166
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,410
anything that has to do with sugar

167
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:17,689
transport and so I think that what

168
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,550
people don't do is they get new plants

169
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:21,709
and they need to send out tissue sample

170
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,759
of those plants to a lab it's 550 bucks

171
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:28,339
and you can get a virus analysis and

172
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,899
then you do your diligence on searching

173
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:32,509
the plant for things that you can

174
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:34,489
visibly see and then you let the lab

175
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:36,379
search if the things that you can't see

176
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:39,769
and now you know you have a plant that's

177
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:41,540
pretty decent and if it's priceless then

178
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:43,819
you send it off to a lab and get it

179
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,250
meristem cultured let them scrub it let

180
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,469
them return it to you clean if it

181
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,389
doesn't have any virus issues it doesn't

182
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,970
need to be meristem scrub so you can

183
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:55,459
save yourself the five grand but you got

184
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,960
to make that decision I ask people all

185
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:59,029
the time when I go to these jobs I said

186
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,219
who picked the library but why you

187
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:04,179
growing these plants and they go because

188
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:07,520
this is what was here before and I said

189
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,980
what what's the basis of the choice and

190
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,899
no one can answer it the investors can't

191
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,660
answer it the growers can't answer it

192
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:17,029
and so you look at these things and you

193
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,460
just like wait a second there has to be

194
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:23,409
a really clear idea of what you're

195
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:25,430
trying to do with your production

196
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,020
destination where the products are going

197
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,699
to go what you're going to use and

198
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:30,979
instead of trying to make these

199
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:32,659
phenomenal collections of eight thousand

200
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,190
different types of varieties you get

201
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,009
core varieties you can work with that

202
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,479
you know that you can understand that

203
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:40,939
there are problems if they have

204
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,700
inherently with resistance and then you

205
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,290
can simplify it and then you can expand

206
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,110
what you work with but man people take

207
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:50,599
on so much complexity they don't look at

208
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,610
the problem clearly enough and then when

209
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,009
it moves out of that quarantined

210
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,289
to the nursery then it spreads into all

211
00:08:55,009 --> 00:09:00,139
the bays so it's not even isolated in

212
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:02,750
one Bay it's in all the bays and now

213
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:05,269
there's nothing you can do it's just

214
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,759
non-stop trying to sterilize the space

215
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:10,009
bring new material in but I'm telling

216
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,409
you these things can hide in a fucking

217
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:15,110
molecule and when they pop out they pop

218
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:17,838
out with like 8,000 children Russert

219
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:19,789
mites were considered deadly but the

220
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,980
aphid makes all of these things look

221
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:27,649
really really simple it's true man and

222
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,829
and the virus the protocols now with

223
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:32,929
some of this stuff are insane and that's

224
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:34,549
something that people can also you know

225
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:36,528
a lot of times these nurseries are kind

226
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:39,078
of transparent on how they do things and

227
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:41,389
so you might be able to pick up nowadays

228
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,699
on how well they're dealing on

229
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:47,240
containing their virus because this this

230
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,800
shit is no joke you know and so there's

231
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,079
nurseries I know and things their

232
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,088
protocols are insane and I mean each mom

233
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:56,149
has its own set of scissors they don't

234
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:57,949
ask for scissors for it yeah it doesn't

235
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:59,929
move you don't take it with you anywhere

236
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:02,240
it stays in a cup of bleach right there

237
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:05,689
near you know that plant or that

238
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,930
specific area of the plant so each plant

239
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,760
has its own scissors the D leafing when

240
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:12,500
you're moving around and deleting cuz

241
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:15,259
you're making wounds there I mean it's

242
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,698
just kind of crazy I mean it's it's kind

243
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:18,110
of coincidental that we're dealing with

244
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:19,639
that you know that I know the Dutton's

245
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:24,169
been around for a while but now with

246
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:25,370
this corona virus and the HPL virus or

247
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:29,809
whatever everybody's getting real

248
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:35,990
fucking you know Sanitary talking about

249
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:37,819
drinking rocks and if you're if you're

250
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,560
running if you're running these nursery

251
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,800
operations and you get this infestation

252
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:44,778
and you release it into any of these

253
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,809
operations the lawsuits are going to

254
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:49,399
bury you alive and the the thing that I

255
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:51,739
noticed is that you know every

256
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,070
investment group has some attorneys fond

257
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,720
upon the team so lawsuits aren't hard to

258
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,660
file when you're business partners a

259
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,720
lawyer and it really starts to create

260
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:04,250
issues where the the nurseries and even

261
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,810
if it's in-house nurseries it's your

262
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,970
in-house nursery you have to treat

263
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:09,019
like you're gonna get sued because

264
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,000
you're going to end up killing your own

265
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,559
business but for it you know while

266
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,289
shooting ursery they provide to the

267
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,079
public the diligence they have to put

268
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:19,669
together to make sure they're protected

269
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,250
because there'll be no forgiveness for

270
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:23,899
the mistake because the margins are so

271
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,220
small that you can't make it up and

272
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:27,019
here's fast we could we could make

273
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,910
mistakes because we were all in the

274
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,889
learning curve and we all had a

275
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:33,129
different level of the ability to what

276
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:36,169
we could do because lack of legalization

277
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:38,960
changed our ability to actually put

278
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:40,309
together stable infrastructure but now

279
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,259
that all that's in play

280
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:44,539
man it puts you in a hell of honorable

281
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:46,759
situation and I think that's where the

282
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:49,069
rise of the labs are coming in where the

283
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,289
the technology to get around these

284
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,450
issues with orchid to get around it with

285
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:55,699
banana to get around it with strawberry

286
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,080
they had to go that route because they

287
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,430
couldn't control it any other way

288
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,620
they're going to transfer in our

289
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:02,629
direction and I just think that that's

290
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,269
important for nursery operators to

291
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:07,669
understand that the technology that's

292
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:11,088
coming out to deal with these issues is

293
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:13,399
expensive and it's not simple to do and

294
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:14,960
you have to make sure you're clear that

295
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,909
that's going to be the future that's

296
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,070
coming so if you make the decision to be

297
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:20,899
a nursery operator you develop

298
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,930
partnerships with these groups for you

299
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:26,299
become your own laboratory based system

300
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:29,120
but ok I think a lot of the conventional

301
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:30,559
agricultural practices we had and how we

302
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,330
function prior are going to change

303
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,939
dramatically just like socially with the

304
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:37,810
coronavirus mean this shit just change

305
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,810
the world in a day
