1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,189
when you were first growing in Michigan

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:05,969
and you were first growing up and

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,220
humbled

4
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:10,888
what were the genetics that you came

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,048
into that you were just like this is

6
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:15,689
amazing and who gave it to you what was

7
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:17,939
things I I'm from I'm from Michigan so

8
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:22,800
yours is gonna be like mine are gonna be

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:26,189
wacky it names the my my name's Williams

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:37,320
wonder was that was my baby

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:41,369
I loved Williams wonder and we'll just a

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,960
big fat I don't know how true it is I

13
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,890
was told that Williams wonders like in

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,960
an indoor only strange that it has to be

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,579
has to be flower under 12 12 and 12 and

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,100
it won't it won't start

17
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,179
outdoor fast enough and I mean I was

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:02,250
Michigan didn't matter but it was like a

19
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:05,938
super strong Lysol and just I it was the

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:09,209
bud there was the it wasn't leafy you

21
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:11,759
had really big leaves and then one day

22
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:12,989
you'd walk in and all of your plants

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,700
would be hanging over because they would

24
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,679
just plump up at the same time then you

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,400
start have to it like it was just really

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,000
fast really quick and like low

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,640
maintenance

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,030
I did that with super Silver Haze as

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,280
just a good strong thing that was gonna

30
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:35,489
reduce mol deal with mold because I was

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:40,469
you know a new grower and get something

32
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:43,919
to be mold resistant I think for years I

33
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:46,379
grew just a few strains Platinum Girl

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,759
Scout cookies which was platinum og Girl

35
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:54,449
Scout cross that was bonkers just just

36
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,099
the most fire just well everybody was

37
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,509
just beautiful like and it was always

38
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:59,218
dense you get when you grew that

39
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,718
straight is like dropping little rocks

40
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:03,599
in your in your bucket when you're

41
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,368
trimming you know so like I can just pop

42
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,159
or like you know the oh geez and stuff

43
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:13,050
are a little bit lighter and so I grew

44
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:20,659
that Platinum cookie strain I grew Tahoe

45
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:24,180

46
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:26,490

48
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:33,500
three three strains the Tahoe Louie and

49
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:36,810
and cookies which were like you know I

50
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,669

51
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,219
I and I like myself and those trains

52
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:47,519
were all fucker like yep you know pretty

53
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:49,829
heavy in because you had a lot of hype I

54
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,680
mean right I mean I I think I can't

55
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,050
really love Lou in town there's still

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,099
two of my favorite strains though the

57
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:01,980
the limonene in Tahoe was like so

58
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,840
pronounced like you just smell this like

59
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,879
citrus coming off that plant and with

60
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,120
that fuel underneath those and they grew

61
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,090
so as I grew perfectly warm cool and

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,360
chunky yeah and then the Louise had that

63
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,159
awesome crown and crown of yeah they

64
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,239
were really cool they purple out and

65
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,699
then really at that whole greenhouse

66
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,560
purple doubt well that was the girl the

67
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,589
Platinum girls get they would to like

68
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,789
yeah the Platinum will just you know get

69
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,709
a little cold at night and they were

70
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,959
just coke just turn into things you

71
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,310
think really shiny supple even like the

72
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,310
density of a baseball though
