1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,849
I think over the last two weeks having

2
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,039
experienced

3
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:22,050
most of the pain points of the panel my

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,820
direct self with my own two hands then I

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,820
think that it's you know it's a little

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,010
bit more somber and a little less

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:32,099
exciting and there's a lot more reality

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,989
and I really wish and I hate to burst

9
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,659
your bubble Peter I really wish this was

10
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:41,159
a packed house because everyone needs to

11
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:43,049
hear it and and this is this what I know

12
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,519
we're filming it but we also have a

13
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:47,069
bunch of people smoking weed outside

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,140
that if they will but if they want that

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,730
cannabis and they want and they want it

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,770
easy and they want to buy it from

17
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:55,109
northern Californians they want to buy

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,000
it from a heritage growing region you

19
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:59,189
know we have to talk about how this

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,570
cannabis is going to get down here we

21
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:02,608
have to talk to about how we're gonna

22
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,500
work together cultivators to retailers

23
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,049
we're have to talk about how cultivators

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,239
have to you know have to adjust we have

25
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,140
to talked about retailers adjusting we

26
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:12,449
have to talk about distribution

27
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,310
adjusting we have to talk about legal

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,019
adjusting you know there's all of these

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,350
different things that you know there's

30
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:21,420
just Minh to make and it really sucks

31
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,298
because the lives of a lot of these

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,430
cultivators hang in the balance

33
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:30,090
you know a lot of us are either two

34
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:33,118
weeks away or two weeks past a big loss

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:37,950
and so we don't have time to fight it

36
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:40,680
out so we were hoping this would be you

37
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,540
know sort of a distilling of some of the

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,950
retail climate in this area of what

39
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,960
we've had to deal with as in order to

40
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,390
Northern California cultivators coming

41
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,328
down into Southern California and and

42
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,450
and the the the introduction to the

43
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:56,599
retail market and how it is that we

44
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,228
could do this without as much pain so

45
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:04,468
before you know I go up here is uh one

46
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:06,569
of my favorite people on the planet you

47
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:09,389
know some somebody that you know when

48
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,889
they showed up at a meeting at a

49
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,489
Mendocino cannabis Policy Council

50
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,500
meeting you know four years ago

51
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,560
we were like oh damn there now that's

52
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,490
pro you know we have a chance and

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,110
hezekiah you know showed up for us and

54
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,240
you know informing the CGA it was a

55
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,860
really big rallying point for the

56
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,310
Northern California farmers to feel like

57
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,320
we had a voice in Sacramento it was you

58
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,650
know it was the first introduction to

59
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,180
policy for a lot of us and hezekiah

60
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,250
coming from a long background of

61
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,349
environmental advocacy work up in

62
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:46,939
Sacramento it really made it easy for us

63
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:47,840
you know it made off shit nothing made

64
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:51,740
it easy all right

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,539
sorry okay it gave us confidence how's

66
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,240
that sound and we were outspent a

67
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:57,679
hundred to one on on most bills that

68
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,650
came through the house for the first two

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,140
years and we were victorious on most of

70
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,900
them we had you know put it this way

71
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:07,879
being outspent to that to that degree

72
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,050
and to be able to get the victories we

73
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,729
were able to eke out for the small

74
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,439
cultivators in Northern California to be

75
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:14,659
able to exist in this current framework

76
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:17,240
wall we had people like Shawn Parker

77
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:19,250
putting millions of dollars to advocate

78
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,890
that Camel Harris that the only way to

79
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,979
stop narco trafficking was to put it in

80
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:26,809
the hands of four four large

81
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:29,149
corporations and let that let the big

82
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,370
boys manage it because we were fucking

83
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,990
up as small batch cultivators and we

84
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,090
were cartel and we were evil and we were

85
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:37,430
water extractors hiring surveys from

86
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,310
different water authorities to create

87
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,960
this you know the stigma around what it

88
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,120
was that we were doing and so we've had

89
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,460
a lot and hezekiah sat up there every

90
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,259
day meeting new people that we were

91
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,000
running from and he was up there in the

92
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:52,280
face of it was really really proud to

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,319
have him you know by her side or at her

94
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,530
head or wherever he was but um that was

95
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,530
great

96
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,930
[Music]

97
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:08,000
all right look I did take a hit of

98
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:11,060
tarantula before I came in here and it

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,789
did have sativa Keef on it okay

100
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,389
okay yeah right okay after the panel

101
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:19,608
this is Bobby Bobby is a I mean okay so

102
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:22,509
the other day we were trying to figure

103
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:26,418
out how we were gonna do this thing and

104
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:29,000
quite a few days ago and Bobby stepped

105
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:30,769
up big time right he's my new Bobby big

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,899
time I had one before now this is the

107
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:33,889
new one

108
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:36,649
because at the end of the day he has a

109
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,209
business that he is is trying to you

110
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:40,039
know navigate all of these hurdles and

111
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:42,019
go through all these loopholes and he

112
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,790
was able to go to his comfort zone to

113
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:46,129
say hey you know what I believe what it

114
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,400
is that you guys are doing enough to let

115
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:51,680
you guys figure your shit out through us

116
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,329
for this event and if it wasn't for

117
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,490
Bobby this event wouldn't be going on

118
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:57,229
right now if it wasn't for somebody to

119
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,780
step up and actually was doing it like

120
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,970
that she wouldn't happen you know I'm

121
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:03,918

122
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,280
thank you so much Bobby that's like yeah

123
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:09,740

124
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,719
got Eric man Eric is is like is number

125
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,840
one here he goes you know Long Beach I

126
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,970
met him and with Susan saw res you know

127
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,319
helped her to what she was doing in Long

128
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,510
Beach for a long time

129
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,399
see for distribution getting in he he

130
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:25,819
actually threw the first cannabis event

131
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:28,189
in this space so when I found out that

132
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:30,379
he could do it and Erin hooked us up

133
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:31,969
with the spot I was like man we can do

134
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:33,709
it here so that was really great as well

135
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,820
Eric and then we got a chance to hang

136
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,319
out the other day and he's been

137
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:39,199
introducing me to different people and

138
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,459
I'm when I found about you know that he

139
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,259
could be you know handling the

140
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:43,819
distribution on the panel and that he's

141
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,709
had his own trials and tribulations in

142
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:47,389
Southern California he is going to be a

143
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:48,829
wealth of information for us all to

144
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:53,329
learn what's really going on around here

145
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:55,009
and then we have Ariel Clark who is who

146
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:57,288
is like what I heard is the gatekeeper

147
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,668
to Santa Monica but not only the

148
00:05:57,288 --> 00:06:01,310
gatekeeper Santa Monica is there

149
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:03,799
somebody that has been holding a really

150
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:07,399
sacred message around you know around

151
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,560
equal justice and around around native

152
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:12,049
rights I mean I we met at a at a Native

153
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,589
American sort of like rights panel which

154
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,860
is something near and dear to my

155
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:19,560
because every gram of cannabis that has

156
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,720
grown in the desert is done with stolen

157
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,550
water and they're piping and they're

158
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,080
going to be shipping in water from

159
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,050
outside of that region it does not

160
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,539
belong to them right right now they

161
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,550
might have a thousand foot deep well you

162
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,540
know but but soon enough that water is

163
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,520
going to be coming from Northern

164
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,990
California and and all of our water is

165
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,879
going to be shipped into the desert to

166
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,530
large-scale commodity as it grows it's

167
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,290
going to be produced at around the penny

168
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:46,500
made two cents three cents a you know a

169
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,270
gram and and you know we need that

170
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,040
message going forward an aerial is you

171
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:51,870
know like stress interest and in

172
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,460
protecting those rights and and you know

173
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,910
and and I definitely believe in what

174
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,829
you're doing

175
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,660
and thank you for protecting us in this

176
00:06:55,829 --> 00:07:02,909
event because there's our law firm at

177
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:05,370
the end of the day that's that's who

178
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:09,150
we've got to ask so thank you so much

179
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,949
Ariel and okay so basically here goes

180
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:14,179
and starts what we figure we'd run

181
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:17,159
through right now is sort of like

182
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,620
cultivation to distro right you know

183
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,620
that's that's that's a pain point

184
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,120
initially a lot of you know a lot of

185
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,920
district companies that aren't distro

186
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,660
companies a lot of people you know

187
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,860
myself included you know I was like

188
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,510
alright what are we gonna do I'm gonna

189
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,889
try to figure it out I'm not cultivating

190
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,629
this year so I'm gonna try to I'm gonna

191
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:35,579
try to play distro oh my god what a

192
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:36,779
fucking nightmare because I got to meet

193
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,079
all of these people that said they were

194
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:43,559
distro in or distro they were attempt

195
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:46,319
permits in a possible joint venture with

196
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,420
a guy in a warehouse with a bunch of

197
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,000
other guys usually like five or ten of

198
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:54,480
them stacking their license or or their

199
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,949
jayvees to act as distribution so as

200
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,879
cultivators it's been really hard to

201
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:02,389
meet the right distro so like going down

202
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:06,269
the line I would you know kind of like

203
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:08,490
let's see the easiest way for for a

204
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:12,329
cultivator like one of these cultivators

205
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,620
that might be out here to enter into the

206
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:15,180
legal market to come in through

207
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,100
distribution like how do we get how do

208
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,680
we get to that basic point how do you

209
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,990
know how do we trust a distributor i I

210
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,879
think the first thing that you need to

211
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,790
do is understand what a distributor is

212
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,159
and what a distributor isn't because in

213
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,180
California for the first time alongside

214
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,610
Nevada

215
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,279
we actually have distribution licenses

216
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,649
inside of a cannabis supply chain what

217
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,418
that means is if you thought back to the

218
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,639
world of Colorado or Oregon or

219
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:43,949
Washington they don't have distributor

220
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,659
licenses they have transporter licenses

221
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,190
and that means that they don't have the

222
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,529
right to buy the product

223
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:52,140
so distributors in a normal supply chain

224
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,269
which California is the distributor is

225
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:58,590
the one who buys the product issues the

226
00:08:54,269 --> 00:09:01,409
PIO to the grower buys the product and

227
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:04,170
then sells it to the stores

228
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:06,120
that's what distributors do so the best

229
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:09,089
way to figure out if you have a real

230
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,710
distributor is ask them that question if

231
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,060
they understand that they're a real

232
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,259
distributor and there's plenty of them

233
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:15,209
and then you look at the way

234
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,490
distributors in this industry have

235
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,810
broken out so it used to be that

236
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,340
everybody was a distributor now you

237
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,109
basically have three types of

238
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,600
distributors you have distributors who

239
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,060
are really the brands distribution arm

240
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,960
into the market you have distributors

241
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:33,509
who are logistics only distributors

242
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,400
meaning that you do the selling for them

243
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:37,769
and they'll just deliver your product to

244
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,409
the store and then you have full service

245
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:43,019
distributors who do all of the selling

246
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:45,419
and all of the picking and packing and

247
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,129
all the distributing you just deliver

248
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:49,769
them the finished product so they'll

249
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:53,279
test it etc so those are the three types

250
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:55,740
of distribution I'm curious some of the

251
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,049
folks in different places in the supply

252
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,519
chain what you're seeing from other

253
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:01,799
distributors people ask me all the time

254
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,139
what are your competitors doing and the

255
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,299
answer is lots of different stuff at the

256
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:07,620
same time and if I had to spend time

257
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:09,240
trying to figure out what everyone else

258
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,850
was doing I wouldn't have any time to

259
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,039
work on what I'm doing so I'm curious

260
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:18,210
what you guys see relative to what I

261
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:20,370
said well I think the key to success is

262
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,810
to focus on your own business so good on

263
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,909
you for that worrying about what other

264
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:26,069
people are up to is oftentimes misguided

265
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:28,139
in my opinion Justin you know you

266
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,580
I took Eric sort of heard how do you

267
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,949
trust a distributor I heard what's the

268
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,530
easiest way to find a distributor and

269
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,090
and I'd question whether or not easy is

270
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:37,829
the right strategy there you know the

271
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,660
easiest thing is not always the best

272
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,560
thing the easiest thing is to drop your

273
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:42,839
price and find some

274
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,789
to take it from you that's probably not

275
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,860
the right way to do this in fact it's

276
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:51,059
existential for folks trying to survive

277
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,590
at a small scale you know when and Eric

278
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:53,789
you mentioned sort of the three types I

279
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,620
think those are three great meta

280
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:57,809
categories when we mapped out

281
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,720
distribution we came up with 16 sort of

282
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:02,519
archetypal distributors broken into

283
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,778
those three main categories but there's

284
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,490
a lot of different ways of approaching

285
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:10,289
distribution I I think though that the

286
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,789
question at the end of the day Eric and

287
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:13,490
I can disagree about a lot of things and

288
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:16,049
we have a lot of fun doing that at times

289
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,028
but I think that question you know the

290
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:19,588
first question I'd advise and and the

291
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:20,720
first question I ask of distributors is

292
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:23,100
how many sales accounts do you have

293
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,870
what's your volume what are you moving

294
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,639
and if it's well I thought you were

295
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,039
gonna do that then cool I'll get my own

296
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,409
license and by the way I'm not a grower

297
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,899
I'm not a licensee currently I grew up a

298
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:35,519
grower and then cut my hair and learned

299
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,699
to tie a tie and now it's growing back

300
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,319
because fuck politics at least for the

301
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,690
moment I don't know we'll see

302
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,790
and so you know I see it sort of from an

303
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:48,180
outside perspective and and I recognize

304
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:50,309
that when I say don't take the easy path

305
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:52,519
sometimes you have to like that's that's

306
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:56,009
the nuts and bolts of making ends meet

307
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,720
and so to sort of hedge against don't

308
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:58,740
take the easy path I'd say don't get

309
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,379
attached to it

310
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,389
stay flexible stay on your toes sell as

311
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:06,389
little as possible if you're selling low

312
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:09,360
just cover your bills the market is

313
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:11,549
going to change and grow this will not

314
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,039
be a simple commodity market two cents a

315
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:16,259
gram will exist but so will

316
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:18,120
differentiated pricing cannabis flower

317
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:21,000
is not a commodity it's not

318
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,769
interchangeable and so it's going to

319
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,100
recover it's going to bounce back there

320
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:29,759
is a lot of room to grow especially as

321
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,080
growers build cooperative supply chains

322
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,610
which I'm gonna talk a lot about today

323
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,560
and and increase their confidence

324
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,120
markets run on confidence there's a lot

325
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,949
of market forces that we can talk about

326
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,589
but at the end of the day confidence is

327
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,028
a very important market force and and I

328
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:43,529
think we need to have more of that and

329
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:47,309
and I think this dialogue is a great way

330
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:49,200
to do that well I love to infuse a

331
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:51,569
retail perspective into the distribution

332
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,459
discussion if you're a producer out

333
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,030
there who's wondering how to make that

334
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,819
happen

335
00:12:54,029 --> 00:13:02,129
go to a respected retailer and ask him

336
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:04,590
who are you using you know we have 40

337
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:07,710
maybe 50 distributors who we work with

338
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:09,030
and five to ten of them are actually

339
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,610
professional outfits

340
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:14,519
you would be amazed at the the way that

341
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,950
people drop the ball just being able to

342
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,389
to fulfill your promises to deliver

343
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,520
things when they're supposed to be

344
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:22,830
delivered in the quantities that they're

345
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,299
supposed to be delivered the proper

346
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,690
items that are supposed to be delivered

347
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:29,370
it's it's it's quite basic business so

348
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,830
focus on the fundamentals that's what I

349
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,799
would recommend and I would just say

350
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:36,690
from a legal or regulatory perspective I

351
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,309
just kind of echo what everyone says

352
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,760
you're you want to make sure that just

353
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:43,319
kind of generally you find partners that

354
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,600
understand the rules and regulations are

355
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,750
license you're asking questions about

356
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,279
their ability to follow up and do they

357
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,080
understand tax structures do they

358
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,600
understand rules so you know getting a

359
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,040
good laundry list of initial questions

360
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,330
and then making sure that they're

361
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:01,259
licensed and that you've got the

362
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:03,509
appropriate contracts in place I thought

363
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:05,639
I'd take a crack at one of the questions

364
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:09,088
that or one of the suggestions that

365
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:12,210
Hezekiah talked about and that is how if

366
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:15,210
you want to get your products market how

367
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:16,800
do you get it to market and III think

368
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:19,410
there's a couple frameworks that we can

369
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,439
learn from other adjacent industries

370
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:25,679
when you think about brewpubs for

371
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:29,040
example and craft beer it feels a whole

372
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,649
lot like craft cannabis so how do they

373
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,559
make money well generally the way they

374
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:37,049
make money is they supply to their

375
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,879
community and their community starts out

376
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:40,620
as a brew pub there's just one

377
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,750
restaurant and then they decide that

378
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,789
people really like mine so I'm gonna

379
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,700
make more and then they figure out that

380
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:49,289
well now I'm producing for a whole bunch

381
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,390
of other people cuz I just know how to

382
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:53,730
produce so what I'm gonna do is produce

383
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:56,338
with these seven other guys and we're

384
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,560
gonna pay somebody to market that and

385
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,940
get it to a bigger market right but

386
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,879
that's the way you should think about it

387
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,700
start start with your own confines and

388
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,208
go from there because the harder it is

389
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,119
going to get harder as

390
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:11,888
you move away from your home base that's

391
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:14,920
where that's where leverage doesn't work

392
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:17,110
anymore right you need the scale or you

393
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:18,789
the distance is gonna get in your way so

394
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,188
if you would generally want to think

395
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:22,688
about you know I I know it's hard for

396
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:25,269
there's a whole lot of people in the

397
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:27,610
same place go find a place that's close

398
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:29,019
by that your relatives live in and see

399
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,509
if you can supply them with their

400
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:33,369
cannabis but find out one place first

401
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:35,499
and then a second place and then a third

402
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:36,910
place go right to the customer because

403
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:38,800
that's who's ultimately gonna buy and

404
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:40,990
frankly in this business right now and

405
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,208
for the foreseeable future it's gonna be

406
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,129
the hard part is getting to the customer

407
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:47,018
and so since Eric followed up I'm gonna

408
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:48,699
follow up too and what he said is

409
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:50,799
exactly correct go to the customer

410
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:52,868
forget all about the distributor forget

411
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,818
all about the retailer love you both

412
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:57,189
go meet the people who love your

413
00:15:54,818 --> 00:16:00,219
cannabis get to know them social media

414
00:15:57,188 --> 00:16:03,068
has broken down the geo geographical

415
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,720
nature of the the brewpub model to some

416
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:06,669
degree obviously you'd still have to

417
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,709
have the cannabis to consume it but you

418
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:11,469
know physical realities do still matter

419
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:13,568
to some degree but get to know consumers

420
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,610
talk directly to them there are so many

421
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:18,248
different kinds of humans and it's so

422
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,318
exciting how many humans there are and

423
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:22,360
all different they love all different

424
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:24,068
things get to know them find the people

425
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,409
that love exactly what you're doing and

426
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:28,088
love your story and the partners will be

427
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:30,338
there to get it in the supply chain and

428
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:32,499
so I do think Eric hit the nail on the

429
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:35,170
head go to the consumer

430
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:36,730
farmers knowing consumers the people who

431
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:38,979
make things knowing the people who

432
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:41,019
consume things is really good for

433
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:45,970
Humanity in general and it's especially

434
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:49,419
good when it comes to cannabis so as the

435
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:51,399
retailer or do you get consumers saying

436
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:52,990
hey do you have this brand and then that

437
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:55,058
sort of gets you thinking about that

438
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:58,019
brand of the brain and then yeah

439
00:16:55,058 --> 00:17:01,208
absolutely I mean if a brand has really

440
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:03,039
has really garnered a following sure and

441
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:06,250
if they're distributed exclusively

442
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:09,338
through a single company you know that

443
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:11,709
definitely draws our attention so like

444
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:13,720
heads was saying you know if you believe

445
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:16,089
in your product there is someone else

446
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,159
out there that does - there really is

447
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:19,958
and you just got to find those people go

448
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:21,970
to them drum up demand

449
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,640
roots and before you know it I've got

450
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:28,568
consumers asking me to stock it well I'm

451
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,429
gonna go stock it very simple all right

452
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:35,408
so we jumped ahead a little bit into

453
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:38,470
retail but I like no it's good we're on

454
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:40,240
a journey here okay we don't want to

455
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,710
fill up at gas at three-quarters of the

456
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:48,759
tank gonna wait till we get in a quarter

457
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:50,470
all right so the idea it's a journey

458
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:53,319
it was the best journey analogy I could

459
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:57,759
come up with at the moment okay all

460
00:17:53,319 --> 00:18:00,308
right so anyway so brands right so you

461
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,819
you you form a brand right you want to

462
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:05,980
have you know five different strains

463
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:07,960
going into your brand right because it

464
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,179
meets the brand ethos you want to have

465
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:14,649
sativa sativa hybrid how you know what

466
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:16,360
you want to go down the gamete and you

467
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:19,658
have to get them all tested your your

468
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:24,308
your your licensing sort of you know

469
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:25,929
multiple small batch you know strains so

470
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:27,490
you have to see you have to test so

471
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:30,340
you're looking at like five thousand

472
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,558
dollars that you know to test as a brand

473
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:35,408
how is a distributor you helping

474
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:37,629
alleviate any of this force a creative

475
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:40,419
in Northern California sometimes we grow

476
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,630
to keep genetic diversity I mean we'll

477
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:45,730
keep you know eight to ten strains going

478
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:47,289
and if we draw if we get demand for five

479
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:50,110
of those and then we have to test all

480
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:53,079
five of them that that puts us out so

481
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:56,288
how how as a distributor could you see

482
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:58,389
easing that pain of testing so brands

483
00:18:56,288 --> 00:19:01,210
can even get into the marketplace to see

484
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,549
what put what performs well so the main

485
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,230
answer the main answer is the real

486
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:07,599
answer which is writing a check for a

487
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:10,390
lot of the products at once right so

488
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:12,908
what we do uniquely as opposed to if you

489
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,009
go directly to the thirty stores that

490
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:16,600
we're gonna put you in they're gonna

491
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:18,158
write you different checks and they're

492
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:20,139
gonna clear at different times trust me

493
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,700
in this business a quarter of they're

494
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,200
gonna be checks the rest of the bags of

495
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,778
cash and you're gonna get them at

496
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,519
different times the point is we're gonna

497
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:29,259
give it to you all at the same time so

498
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,690
that you can test it in as big a batch

499
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:32,859
as you can test it in because you said

500
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,679
five thousand dollars

501
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:38,740
our tests cost $500 so if we can do one

502
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:43,000
test for a bigger batch that's the best

503
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,440
way we can help you do that correct but

504
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,630
but the other thing I would tell you is

505
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,730
I I would teach you that you want you

506
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,140
don't you want to do them in cycles so

507
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,360
that you have a batch you don't want to

508
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:55,690
necessarily do the way that a lot of the

509
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:58,269
rooms in LA look two years ago which is

510
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,950
they have you know 25 different strains

511
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:02,650
in the same room now I see them they're

512
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,759
two strains in the same room so is does

513
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,320
that mean you don't have it you just

514
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,808
have it at different times you just

515
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:10,119
adjust to the situation yeah I mean the

516
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:11,500
hard truth is well a this isn't the

517
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:13,389
distributor's fault this is the

518
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,509
regulations fault we need to do a lot

519
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,860
more in the state capital the regulatory

520
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:21,730
requirements with regard to testing are

521
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:23,409
bad not in that they test for things and

522
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:26,079
keep consumers safe but in that they

523
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:29,080
force us to test in a way that costs way

524
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:31,569
more than is absolutely required to keep

525
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:33,308
consumers safe one of the big reasons I

526
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:34,779
got involved in the policy side was to

527
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:36,879
make sure that people had good clean

528
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:39,819
cannabis to smoke because heavy metals

529
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,470
are not great and other things that come

530
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:43,450
from those types of pollutants so this

531
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,730
is a regulatory problem first and

532
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:48,009
foremost secondly I would say that we do

533
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,980
need to start coordinating our crops to

534
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:53,319
match with the regulatory requirements a

535
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,450
little bit better 50-pound batch size we

536
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:58,808
should be growing 50 pounds that doesn't

537
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:01,539
need to be necessarily all that you grow

538
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:03,970
but at least grow one or two 50-pound

539
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:05,500
baseline batches that you can get into

540
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,798
the market at a more cost-effective

541
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:11,619
price a pretty typical brand strategy

542
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,089
that I'm you know advising maybe seeing

543
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:15,548
succeed I don't know it's really hard to

544
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:17,500
gauge success this early on but you know

545
00:21:15,548 --> 00:21:19,450
you've got your two workhorse varietals

546
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,470
that you grow your big batch of that you

547
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,850
can get into the market at

548
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,009
cost-effective and then maybe you have

549
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:25,808
six small batch varietals that are

550
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:27,579
coming in behind that and let's be fair

551
00:21:25,808 --> 00:21:29,349
fifty pounds is a relatively small batch

552
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:32,619
to begin with in the face of some of

553
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:34,119
what we're seeing emerge these days so

554
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:35,739
it's not necessarily all on the

555
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:37,389
distributor to bring that cost down is

556
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,099
the bottom line some of it is going to

557
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,050
require continued organization and

558
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:43,869
advocacy there are things that the

559
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:46,159
growers can do to to help reduce those

560
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,869
costs as well and I mean

561
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,340
the end of the day I think we all need

562
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:52,609
to do a much better job of communicating

563
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:55,339
again directly with consumers there is a

564
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:57,139
cost of growing California's most

565
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:59,119
sustainable cleanest agricultural

566
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,759
product and that cost is going to be

567
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:04,459
reflected at the gram at the 8th at the

568
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,529
half ounce level frankly I'm willing to

569
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,299
pay 50 cents more a gram to know that

570
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:10,759
there was nothing funky that went into

571
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:12,950
that but we need to make sure that that

572
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,809
is commonly accepted and understood I'll

573
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,549
mention the word again cooperatives I

574
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:19,279
think we need more cooperation between

575
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:21,109
producer and consumer as well and more

576
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,720
of an open dialogue there so we

577
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:25,669
understand where the cost of the product

578
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,400
at the retail point is going in the

579
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:31,190
supply chain there's a lot that can be

580
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,440
done I just I wanted to piggyback on

581
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,630
what you're saying Hezekiah and I really

582
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,090
like this idea of it almost sounds like

583
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,130
reverse engineering like what are the

584
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:42,859
rules and regulations what do we have to

585
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,970
navigate through and and and folks who

586
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:46,219
are in different segments of the market

587
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,259
understanding those rules now granted

588
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,579
they continue to change so much it's

589
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:51,529
like you're like standing on quicksand

590
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:53,089
so at some point they're gonna firm up

591
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:55,519
and of course they're gonna be tons of

592
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:56,929
changes over the years but you know when

593
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,059
we're talking about how do we get to

594
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,460
solutions a lot of that is about

595
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:03,589
information knowledge knowledge sharing

596
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,930
through cooperative associations through

597
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:07,849
trade associations as much as we can

598
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:09,830
come together as a community and share

599
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:12,259
information so you know things like

600
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:14,059
maybe this is the way I should approach

601
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:15,710
this issue or how many strains I should

602
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,109
have in this room or what kind of issues

603
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:21,350
might I come up against when my product

604
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:24,139
goes to be tested so you know my kind of

605
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:25,730
my hope for us all is more information

606
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,400
sharing so thank you for this thank you

607
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,809
for what all of all of we all do and

608
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,860
many people in the room who are involved

609
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:37,579
in the discussion and sharing the very

610
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:39,979
valuable information just a touch on the

611
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:42,169
the information about these regulations

612
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,670
and such getting out to consumers I

613
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,880
really view it as more of a

614
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:48,500
responsibility of all of us

615
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,650
retailers myself being a big part in

616
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,519
that and organizations like CGA or the

617
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:57,769
SCC or whomever that's out there

618
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:59,359
interfacing with regulators you know

619
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,960
it's it's important for the end consumer

620
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,429
to know

621
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,400
and I've got all of those touch points

622
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,360
tens of thousands of touch points so I'm

623
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,269
doing what I can

624
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:10,099
it's tough it really is so that leads

625
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:14,299
perfectly into my next question which is

626
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:17,629
we're going into retail okay so what as

627
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:20,299
a retailer could a distributor do two

628
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,920
E's and I'm not talking and I'm not

629
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:23,779
talking about the transpose and the

630
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,789
manifest and all of those things like to

631
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:27,230
drive traffic for the brands because at

632
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:29,779
the end of the day anybody will do

633
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,000
anything to get you the right legal

634
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:34,670
material if you're driving traffic and

635
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,210
if we're selling cannabis so what could

636
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:40,730
the distributor do to help you in brand

637
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,650
education and getting you more SKUs that

638
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,720
you feel are working better and being a

639
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,400
more dynamic relationship between retail

640
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,440
and distribution I would say first off

641
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,050
it's not about getting more SKUs it's

642
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:54,230
about doing one SKU really really well

643
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:58,250
start start there and move you know

644
00:24:54,230 --> 00:25:00,259
expand as you can hold your promises as

645
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,289
a distributor you know like I was

646
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:04,309
mentioning before we've got about five

647
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:06,379
distribution companies that are really

648
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:08,509
really good at what they do and the rest

649
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,070
are a pain in the ass to work with

650
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:11,480
because they don't they don't follow

651
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:13,700
through on what they're saying that

652
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,809
they're gonna do so number one is just

653
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:20,830
learn the fundamentals of business and

654
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:23,329
keep it simple and do it really well I

655
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:26,119
mean I really can't emphasize that

656
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:28,009
enough you know as a an online business

657
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:30,799
I essentially have an e-commerce

658
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:31,640
business the more marketing that you do

659
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,769
for yourself

660
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,900
like has was mentioning earlier get on

661
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:38,269
social media and really drum up demand

662
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:40,070
for your own product that way people are

663
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:42,829
already salivating a little bit when

664
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:45,259
they hit my website you know and once

665
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:49,609
they do hit my website give me really

666
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:50,390
awesome like 2018 product shots that I

667
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:52,609
can put up

668
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,620
give me lab tests that are really easy

669
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:56,899
for me to display give me product

670
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:59,779
descriptions hell if you're a farmer

671
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:02,120
record a video standing in front of that

672
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:04,460
plant on your farm and I will put it on

673
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:07,099
my website in the product description so

674
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,289
the end consumer can see exactly who the

675
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:11,199
hell was watering their their flower you

676
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:13,210
know so

677
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,528
I think it's just all of those things

678
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:19,899
and keeping it simple you know one thing

679
00:26:16,528 --> 00:26:21,190
not a distributor or a retailer but that

680
00:26:19,898 --> 00:26:24,308
I think is relevant to this conversation

681
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:27,669
you know as I'm reintegrating into the

682
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:30,220
business community lovingly known as

683
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,509
sell more weed and I'm allowed to say

684
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,339
that now which I wasn't allowed to

685
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:34,898
before last time I did it it's been

686
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:38,319
about five or six years since I've been

687
00:26:34,898 --> 00:26:40,239
in the game but you know frankly strain

688
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,220
names don't mean anything the consumers

689
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,259
are totally confused by it we've got

690
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:47,620
40,000 strains at the end of the day

691
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:49,450
there's probably 400 actual chemo types

692
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:51,158
I don't know somebody can argue with me

693
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:55,720
later I love to have this fight it's

694
00:26:51,159 --> 00:27:00,159
there it's really good fun we have this

695
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:02,889
really really strong sense of pride in

696
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,750
our craft and we want to tell people all

697
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:06,908
about all the distinctions and the

698
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:09,130
varieties and the diversity and that's

699
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:10,690
really important but right now we're

700
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,399
also struggling with something much

701
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:14,259
bigger which is the fact that we have an

702
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:16,808
entrenched and mature market that

703
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:19,720
unfortunately hasn't been regulated so

704
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:21,038
most consumers probably don't know that

705
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,048
they're getting cannabis from an

706
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,730
unlicensed retailer they probably don't

707
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:26,679
know that that's supporting an

708
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,659
unlicensed supply chain they probably

709
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:30,399
don't know that it's untested that it

710
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:32,559
hasn't met those requirements we just

711
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:35,589
talked about and so as we're looking at

712
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,720
bringing several brands this being one

713
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:39,209
of them several cooperative brands mind

714
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,259
you I'm only going to represent

715
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,298
cooperative cannabis from here on out

716
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:49,000
because I believe Humanity is competing

717
00:27:43,298 --> 00:27:51,369
itself into extinction so you know as we

718
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,308
as we move forward with this we're not

719
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:56,259
advertising the farms the varietals the

720
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:57,970
strains so much as we're advertising our

721
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:00,638
retail partners these guys are out there

722
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,589
on the front line we need to the general

723
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:04,689
public to understand that they are the

724
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:07,329
gatekeeper to good clean sustainable

725
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:10,778
cannabis it's just the way it is that's

726
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:12,579
a fact from now on and so yes of course

727
00:28:10,778 --> 00:28:14,740
the video of the person watering it is

728
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:16,720
great but what about a map of places to

729
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,609
get sustainable cannabis what about

730
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,298
little stars where every retailer is and

731
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:23,619
so well you can talk about them I'm

732
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:24,730
gonna stay away from talking about them

733
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,909
frankly

734
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:31,210
and so you know this idea of of

735
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:33,820
highlighting this new emerging market

736
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:36,490
and and trust me I've got one foot not

737
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:39,099
one foot a part of my heart is in the

738
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,990
old world a lot of my family most of my

739
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:44,679
friends have not made this transition

740
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:46,930
and so it pains me deeply to say that

741
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,850
what we need to do is focus all of this

742
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,860
attention on the licensed marketplace

743
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:52,869
because I do think that there was a lot

744
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:54,399
of injustice embedded in our so-called

745
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:56,739
legalization initiative and I think

746
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,720
we've got a lot more work to do but the

747
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,400
truth of the matter is it is what it is

748
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,650
I'm a pragmatic realist and at this

749
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,450
point we need people to be going to the

750
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:07,540
licensed stores that's what's going to

751
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:10,029
drive the market that's going to make it

752
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:12,430
so that people care about our varietals

753
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:15,309
and care about our Appalachians and care

754
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:17,529
about all of that stuff so as we look at

755
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:20,379
we will be acquiring a delivery or a

756
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:22,329
distribution license expecting

757
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,070
operational in March and as we look

758
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:25,720
forward at our business planning and and

759
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:27,939
you know it's really about highlighting

760
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:32,589
the retailers that's what we want to do

761
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:35,620
to help make this thing work I want to

762
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:38,980
say thank you for that and I want to say

763
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:41,829
that that's dead correct right that's

764
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:46,690
the magic the business is about the

765
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:50,980
consumer and the consumer has today too

766
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:56,110
many ways to get cannabis in the wrong

767
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:59,319
way so it my estimate of the size of the

768
00:29:56,109 --> 00:30:03,329
California demand market at retail is

769
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:06,909
between 15 and 20 billion dollars a year

770
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:09,490
right now we're on track to do 3 billion

771
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:11,800
of that through the white market Channel

772
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:15,609
that means the black and gray channels

773
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:19,029
are between 12 and 17 billion dollars in

774
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:21,459
size just in California Eric can I make

775
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:22,899
a humble request when it comes to

776
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,819
semantics can we describe it as

777
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,290
regulated and unregulated as opposed to

778
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:28,089
black and white are you okay with that

779
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:28,509
I'll tell you why it needs to be this

780
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:31,449
way

781
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:33,549
because there's a gray market and in

782
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:35,480
order to get to gray you have to see

783
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:39,230
black and what if we have red

784
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:42,139
unregulated and criminal you you like

785
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:45,950
that better much better like mountains

786
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:47,569
better I really do okay I was just

787
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:50,538
thinking about this today because I'm

788
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:52,428
writing it on paper and my preference

789
00:30:50,538 --> 00:30:55,819
would be to preface it by saying this is

790
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:59,889
an economic term and it means something

791
00:30:55,819 --> 00:31:02,778
to economists and I didn't make it up

792
00:30:59,888 --> 00:31:06,019
okay okay so would that go criminal on

793
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:23,509
black unregulated on gray and regulated

794
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:25,069
on unregulated well I mean you never you

795
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:26,629
know you don't know that you know

796
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:28,638
there's not that's not true at all

797
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:30,260
there's not there's not a big moonshine

798
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:31,788
market today there's a lot of people

799
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:36,528
that are considered criminals that

800
00:31:31,788 --> 00:31:38,179
aren't they're just broke so yeah they

801
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:40,849
can't afford to get regulated that

802
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:42,500
regulated market is a beast okay so I'll

803
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:44,000
just clarify when I use these three

804
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,888
terms regulate it's pretty clear right

805
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,450
regulated means you have a license and

806
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:50,028
you can prove that you're following the

807
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:52,130
rules unregulated means you would be if

808
00:31:50,028 --> 00:31:54,079
that was attainable criminal means you

809
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,700
have no intent of participating those

810
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,710
are the three camps that I see I

811
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,778
actually have seven categories and big

812
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:04,819
into archetypes but we'll stick with the

813
00:31:59,778 --> 00:32:06,648
three all right now I want to talk about

814
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:08,778
differentiation in the marketplace and

815
00:32:06,648 --> 00:32:11,268
how that's going to happen from the

816
00:32:08,778 --> 00:32:15,319
distribution and retail level and what

817
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:17,359
you need from us so meaning how do we

818
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:19,609
honor Appalachians how do we honor Sun

819
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:22,240
and and soil grown cannabis Sun star and

820
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:26,509
Moon grown cannabis as Swami would say

821
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:30,079
you know so how do we get people to buy

822
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:31,788
ugly weed that isn't but to them they're

823
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,710
used to vertically integrated indoors

824
00:32:31,788 --> 00:32:37,538
filling this in the shelves of their

825
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:40,460
retailers so the answer is tell a story

826
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:42,528
tell it about the grower tell it about

827
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,720
the product tell it about the experience

828
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:47,829
that you have when you use the product

829
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,759
tell them about why it's great product

830
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:55,798
tell a story write a brand needs to be

831
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:58,028
built and brand I have three heard of

832
00:32:55,798 --> 00:32:59,500
definitions of brand that I like number

833
00:32:58,028 --> 00:33:03,849
one a brand is what they say about you

834
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:06,339
when you leave the room number two is a

835
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:09,398
brand is the difference between the

836
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:19,418
product cost and the retail price that's

837
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:23,739
brand the whole thing is brand brands

838
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:26,019
build tribes so if you want a following

839
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,759
you said it you need a following he's

840
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:30,429
looking for brands that have followings

841
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:32,859
that's what great brands do they have

842
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:35,080
followings I used to be in the beer

843
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:37,898
business and I'm gonna tell you a funny

844
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:41,769
story Narragansett beer was my brand and

845
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:44,859
I would go out and sell beer we we've

846
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:46,298
had three partners and we said for the

847
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:47,918
last 18 months at the time that I was

848
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:50,379
there we're gonna go to 50 bars a week

849
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,720
each so I would go to our after bar

850
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,460
after bar and I would if I walked into

851
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,589
the bar and they didn't have our beer I

852
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,450
would try to sell it if they did have

853
00:33:56,589 --> 00:34:00,699
our beer I would buy six or eight of

854
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:02,980
them I'd line him up on the on the bar

855
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,870
and anybody who wanted a beer I'd try to

856
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:07,750
give him away right do you know that

857
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:10,358
there was one type of person who I could

858
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:13,838
never give a Narragansett beer to anyone

859
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:20,019
want to guess who that was no plenty of

860
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:25,418
women any other guesses no no they were

861
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:28,628
grabbing two at a time the bud drinkers

862
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:30,699
you couldn't come all set no really it's

863
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:33,398
a free beer nope I'm good I'm good I can

864
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:36,489
afford my own beer I can I'm good anyway

865
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:38,679
that's a tribe when when you so the

866
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:41,519
final definition of brand is you have a

867
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:44,039
real brand when someone won't accept a

868
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:47,829
free version of a competitive product

869
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:50,378
that's a real brand okay so that's good

870
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:52,509
for what another tasks you hear this is

871
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:55,569
another thing we have to do what are you

872
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:57,310
doing to help create a differentiation

873
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:58,630
in the marketplace I'm saying like we're

874
00:34:57,309 --> 00:35:01,179
telling the story I mean we're here

875
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,608
where it's non-stop we feel like we tell

876
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:02,960
our story

877
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:05,420
all they were in the grocery store

878
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,309
telling our story to each other we

879
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,338
practice rehearse our story we are so

880
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:12,829
storied it's ridiculous what are you

881
00:35:10,338 --> 00:35:14,358
doing down here to help us create a

882
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:16,789
differentiation in the marketplace and

883
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:18,768
this goes from distro and then what can

884
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:20,299
distro do for retailers and then what

885
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:21,919
can retailers do to the consumer because

886
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:23,329
at the end of the day you know yeah we

887
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,400
can put it on social a lot of us don't

888
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:27,410
go on social you know a lot of us just

889
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,749
grow really good weed and so it's like

890
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:31,489
what do we do when it gets to you and

891
00:35:29,748 --> 00:35:33,649
it's really good and how do you create

892
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:35,630
that differentiation in the marketplace

893
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:39,410
or I'm not saying how do you think how

894
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:41,358
are you helping do that let me start

895
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:44,028
from the retail point of view it's

896
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:45,469
really about like Eric said crafting a

897
00:35:44,028 --> 00:35:48,318
narrative if there's not one that

898
00:35:45,469 --> 00:35:50,118
already exists and it really extracting

899
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:52,759
it from your your you know your

900
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:54,588
producing partner and and then taking a

901
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:57,559
chance and putting that out there and

902
00:35:54,588 --> 00:36:01,429
really standing behind it fully you know

903
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:04,460
and sometimes you have to take risk

904
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:06,739
right there are you were talking about

905
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:10,269
Appalachians Justin you know how do we

906
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:12,650
really be make that a known thing well a

907
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:14,358
distributor a distributor can call it

908
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:16,099
whatever they want a cultivator can call

909
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:18,619
it whatever they want but it doesn't

910
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:20,359
matter unless your retail partner is

911
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:23,480
standing behind you and what you believe

912
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:25,278
so if you are a manufacturer out there

913
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,139
producer out there you've got to find

914
00:36:25,278 --> 00:36:29,480
someone who's willing to take that risk

915
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:32,420
with you and really carve out a niche in

916
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:35,239
the market and and the people who take

917
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:38,210
that risk are the people who create new

918
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:40,999
beautiful things and create movements so

919
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:44,869
a lot of it is risk you know it's it's

920
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:46,608
really taking a chance and being a

921
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:50,690
godforsaken entrepreneur it's what we're

922
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:53,239
all doing out here you know some few

923
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:55,749
things again not a distributor a

924
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:57,858
retailer but I'm gonna apply in any way

925
00:36:55,748 --> 00:37:00,048
there's a lot of different ways to tell

926
00:36:57,858 --> 00:37:01,788
your story I tell my story to my close

927
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:04,699
friends oftentimes with laughter and

928
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:06,230
tears I tell my story in the legislature

929
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:09,199
with a lot of strength and confidence

930
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:11,539
and I tell my consumer my story to the

931
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,909
consumer with a bit of lightheartedness

932
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:15,350
and brevity and so keep in mind that

933
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:18,739
marketing is this particular

934
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:21,079
type of storytelling and the the second

935
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:23,599
and most important thing in my opinion

936
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:26,329
is truth truth in all things but truth

937
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,759
in advertising not all cannabis is great

938
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:31,219
even if you're great grower some

939
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,930
cannabis is just not awesome and that's

940
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:35,269
okay there's a there's a place at the

941
00:37:32,929 --> 00:37:37,489
market for that too the the number one

942
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:39,559
thing that we can do to damage our

943
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:41,959
brands in my opinion is described it as

944
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:43,940
top shelf when it's not and try to

945
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,699
charge top shelf prices for it when it

946
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,860
doesn't warrant it in my opinion only 1%

947
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:49,789
of the flower grown a year is the top 1%

948
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,789
of flower

949
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:55,219
that's just how math works I will pay

950
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:57,909
more for the top 1% of the harvest I

951
00:37:55,219 --> 00:38:00,469
will I connoisseur I've been smoking

952
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:01,779
well not gonna get into how long I've

953
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:03,889
been smoking because I'm pretty young

954
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,269
but for long enough to know the

955
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:07,219
difference you know I don't want to get

956
00:38:05,269 --> 00:38:08,929
a sore throat no matter how pretty it

957
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:11,419
looks if you didn't flush it I'm gonna

958
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:13,519
get a sore throat when I smoke it and so

959
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:16,250
you know really being honest and and

960
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,960
there's there's actually a law that you

961
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:20,719
mentioned the appellations law and

962
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,970
there's a few words in there that you

963
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,309
know they weren't there originally and i

964
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:27,799
put them there and caught some flak for

965
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:29,449
it but standards and practices in my

966
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,090
opinion if we don't have clear

967
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:33,919
agreed-upon standards with which we can

968
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:35,840
reference our story and fact check

969
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,240
ourselves then it's just a bunch of

970
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,150
marketing drivel and who cares let's

971
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:43,609
tell the truth that's what cannabis is

972
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:46,099
about and truth in advertising truth in

973
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:54,070
marketing is what's going to make brands

974
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:57,380
distinguish themselves in my opinion and

975
00:38:54,070 --> 00:39:02,630
to be clear that standards and practices

976
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:06,380
under the silo of origin don't make this

977
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:10,160
a pain point discussion can I jump in

978
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:12,289
with another suggestion you guys are

979
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:15,440
trying to figure out how to tell your

980
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:16,880
story and and and hezekiah got on the

981
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,559
right track when he was talking about

982
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,619
different things at different times in

983
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:24,619
different ways one of the most important

984
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:26,839
things that a grower needs to figure out

985
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:28,980
is whether they just want to be a grower

986
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:32,160
or they want to be a grower and

987
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:35,159
a brand because those are different and

988
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:37,049
if you just want to be a grower go find

989
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:39,000
a bunch of other growers and get

990
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:43,190
together and find one of them who wants

991
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,190
to build a brand and use all their stuff

992
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:49,618
[Music]

993
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,940
that's Ocean Spray that's that's exactly

994
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,470
what a co-op is I didn't want to

995
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,690
prescribe it if you don't want to do it

996
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:56,459
as a co-op do it as a different way the

997
00:39:54,690 --> 00:40:00,090
point is there's lots of ways you could

998
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:03,329
do it it has a kinds of co-op so do it

999
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:05,400
his way but but don't try to do it if

1000
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:07,049
you don't want to do it and don't be

1001
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,780
confused if you're not getting it right

1002
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:11,310
if you're not spending any time on it ya

1003
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,900
know be having a brand's being a public

1004
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:14,489
figure being a public figure is tricky

1005
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,380
especially for underground growers I

1006
00:40:14,489 --> 00:40:18,089
mean let's just be real if especially if

1007
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,390
you want to have a personality driven

1008
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:22,980
brand like it's a lot of work and you

1009
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:25,049
know what at the end of the day there's

1010
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,550
not gonna be 50,000 cannabis brands that

1011
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,320
emerge from California that's how many

1012
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,600
growers we estimate there were there's

1013
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,550
probably going to be a few hundred maybe

1014
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:34,409
a few thousand but at the end of the day

1015
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,480
a lot of growers working together is how

1016
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:40,730
we're going to build the brand Network

1017
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,730
that's going to to make this market work

1018
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:48,800
yeah please do

1019
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,800
please

1020
00:40:51,909 --> 00:41:03,980
coming from that perspective of I have a

1021
00:40:57,309 --> 00:41:08,329
collective 64 and in order to maximize

1022
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:14,260
you know our resources and pool our

1023
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:17,480
cannabis and we need to have one brand

1024
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:22,840
but here we are faced with this stupid

1025
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,840
regulation that's that might just

1026
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:33,028
sure so the the regulation that she's

1027
00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:36,538
talking about I think it's five zero

1028
00:41:33,028 --> 00:41:40,648
three two which basically disallows the

1029
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:43,289
languages non licensees cannot be on a

1030
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:46,199
branded product a non licensee cannot

1031
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:47,939
give specific direction to a licensee on

1032
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:50,519
how they can put together a product so

1033
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:53,428
basically kind of puts aside this white

1034
00:41:50,518 --> 00:41:55,618
labeling arrangement and a lot of other

1035
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:58,889
things because actually taken to any

1036
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:02,519
sort of logical or legal I mean frankly

1037
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:04,259
analysis that section would mean that

1038
00:42:02,518 --> 00:42:06,178
you like they're their issues with

1039
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:08,998
contracts so question whether you could

1040
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:10,648
even enter into a contract for a lease

1041
00:42:08,998 --> 00:42:11,998
right so you have to own the property I

1042
00:42:10,648 --> 00:42:14,938
mean the whole thing is kind of

1043
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:18,358
outrageous our firm tons of other firms

1044
00:42:14,938 --> 00:42:20,128
lots of organizations wrote many lengthy

1045
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:21,838
pages about why this section is very

1046
00:42:20,128 --> 00:42:24,659
problematic hopefully this will get

1047
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:27,619
kicked I wonder if the reason why we saw

1048
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:29,729
it written as such is really because the

1049
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:32,068
agencies really want to see more

1050
00:42:29,728 --> 00:42:33,328
transparency and that's really what

1051
00:42:32,068 --> 00:42:35,248
they're going for so we made some

1052
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:37,919
proposals as to how we can kind of

1053
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:39,238
change the language but in the in in the

1054
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:42,208
case that you're talking about if you're

1055
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:44,458
talking about sixty licensees then you

1056
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:46,348
are a licensee right so that yeah I

1057
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:49,048
don't see that you would have a you

1058
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:50,068
would have a problem were I mean and I

1059
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:52,528
don't know the specifics of your

1060
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:55,108
situation but if everyone if you are all

1061
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:57,239
licensed you would not be impacted by

1062
00:42:55,108 --> 00:42:59,358
the way that section is written from

1063
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:03,599
what I know of what you're describing

1064
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:05,668
would that be yeah would it be true if

1065
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,379
that if the brand didn't represent all

1066
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:09,658
of the farmers but the farmers were

1067
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:11,038
selling through the brand can I do you

1068
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:13,709
mind if I just jump in here because

1069
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:15,539
she's dead on this isn't gonna fly it

1070
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:18,928
doesn't fly because it flies in the face

1071
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:20,759
of normal licensing everyday business

1072
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:24,659
whether you're talking about the media

1073
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:26,789
industry or or toys or candy right so

1074
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:29,669
it's it's gonna go away but let me just

1075
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:32,819
say one more thing I can show you how to

1076
00:43:29,668 --> 00:43:35,788
defeat it right now just give a share of

1077
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:37,318
your stock to everybody in it one share

1078
00:43:35,789 --> 00:43:39,949
you call them an owner and they all

1079
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:43,108
the license yeah yeah yeah basically

1080
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:45,930
basically if the rule if the rule goes

1081
00:43:43,108 --> 00:43:47,940
as is as drafted give me a call and

1082
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:49,679
we'll share with you the the way to get

1083
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,119
around it which is like what's the point

1084
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:52,798
of the rules if we're just trying to

1085
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,959
figure out all these ways to get around

1086
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:57,059
it but okay if that's your system like

1087
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:58,708
we were saying earlier then we know what

1088
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:01,199
your game is and we'll give you what you

1089
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:04,198
want to see you know but I agree I don't

1090
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:06,719
think that I I mean we if we're to we

1091
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,338
passed I mean my god Hezekiah like we

1092
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,679
like worked on this whole statewide

1093
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:12,420
let's regulate the industry program over

1094
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:14,219
all of these years because we care about

1095
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,680
the cottage industry because we care

1096
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:18,239
about the small medium-sized operators

1097
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:20,159
because we care about diversity in the

1098
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,599
industry because we care about women and

1099
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,399
people of color and opportunity for

1100
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,930
people to create wealth that have you

1101
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,150
know all of these like you know

1102
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:29,788
wonderful truthful beautiful things that

1103
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:31,979
make our heart sing and make us wake up

1104
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:34,699
every day and do the work that we do and

1105
00:44:31,978 --> 00:44:38,548
this is just another example of

1106
00:44:34,699 --> 00:44:40,709
regulations really kind of dampening

1107
00:44:38,548 --> 00:44:42,298
that hugely and potentially pushing a

1108
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:44,368
lot of that side because then you have

1109
00:44:42,298 --> 00:44:46,829
smaller or just brands or smaller

1110
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:48,660
operators who can't go and get a license

1111
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:50,309
and enter the market but as I was saying

1112
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:52,949
there you know we'll figure out

1113
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:55,548
workarounds and hopefully all of the you

1114
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:57,059
know letters and lobbying and

1115
00:44:55,548 --> 00:44:58,798
dissatisfaction that we have all

1116
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:02,039
expressed in written and many other

1117
00:44:58,798 --> 00:45:05,728
forms will will you know we'll see some

1118
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:07,709
changes in the rules I I want to bring

1119
00:45:05,728 --> 00:45:09,989
something up here and you know it's

1120
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:12,958
something that I do often into in life

1121
00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:14,728
which is why did that happen and and I

1122
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:17,548
and I'm gonna try my best not to be

1123
00:45:14,728 --> 00:45:20,189
negative here but but its bordering on a

1124
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:22,079
slippery slope there there are people

1125
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:23,759
who are lobbying for this there are

1126
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,469
people who believe that since they have

1127
00:45:23,759 --> 00:45:27,989
a license everyone else should be shut

1128
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:30,329
out there's a tendency in regulated

1129
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:32,999
markets to see barriers to entry as a

1130
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:35,548
good thing because it solidifies your

1131
00:45:32,998 --> 00:45:38,788
control of your place in the market

1132
00:45:35,548 --> 00:45:41,099
there was a very clear understanding in

1133
00:45:38,789 --> 00:45:43,920
2014 that there was an environmental

1134
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:45,869
crisis and a public safety crisis caused

1135
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,659
by the lack of regulation for cannabis

1136
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:50,850
what I moved to Sacramento to do was to

1137
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:52,139
try to add a third to that list which

1138
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:55,139
that there is also a small business

1139
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:57,629
crisis real hard-working Californians

1140
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:59,789
are also in crisis because of the lack

1141
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:02,329
of regulation we did a pretty damn good

1142
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:05,639
job but we could have done better and

1143
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:07,380
the reason that in some ways that I'm

1144
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:09,659
shifting the focus that I am and that

1145
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:12,050
I've been so focused on conversations

1146
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:14,429
direct with consumer is that we need

1147
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:17,820
Californians to stand up for other

1148
00:46:14,429 --> 00:46:20,879
Californians we need everyone to realize

1149
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:23,010
and recognize that our small business

1150
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,320
owners that beautiful diversity that

1151
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:27,510
Arielle outlined of all the different

1152
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:30,059
boxes and even the people who don't fit

1153
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:32,700
in any boxes they have a place in

1154
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:36,029
cannabis we didn't do a good enough job

1155
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:37,739
of making that message known we didn't

1156
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,960
do a good enough job of making that the

1157
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:41,639
consensus but we're not lost yet we're

1158
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,309
not done yet we still need it we need

1159
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:46,650
every single person to tell ten more

1160
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:51,440
that there is a small business crisis we

1161
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:54,360
are losing a wealth of value frankly and

1162
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,970
there are people who actually see it the

1163
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,519
opposite they see their wealth through a

1164
00:46:56,969 --> 00:47:01,169
controlled market I see the wealth as

1165
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:02,730
something that we all need to share and

1166
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:05,400
I think all of you do - that's probably

1167
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:07,260
why we're here together but there are

1168
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,329
there are folks who don't and so do

1169
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,610
always remember you know the parable of

1170
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:13,039
sheeps and wolves clothing and all that

1171
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:15,420
their weight their the other way just

1172
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,039
remember that that different people have

1173
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:21,480
different motivations and different

1174
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:23,159
intentions so something that I was gonna

1175
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,019
open it up to questions yeah I just have

1176
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:28,369
one bit of good news before you open it

1177
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:31,739
up for question but good news is that

1178
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:34,380
the guy that we just elected governor of

1179
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:36,779
the great state of California is a small

1180
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:39,420
business guy he ran on small business

1181
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:42,630
his Blue Ribbon Commission report had a

1182
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,670
small business clause in it where he was

1183
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:47,010
protecting the small business owners so

1184
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:49,440
he hasn't been in a control position

1185
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:51,300
like he's going to be in in January but

1186
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,070
I think there's good good things

1187
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,560
happening on the horizon for small

1188
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:57,720
businesses in California I don't think

1189
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:59,250
any large politician actually has all of

1190
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:01,759
our best interests at heart but he was

1191
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:03,489
you know he's good he's good he's ish

1192
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:08,380
anyway

1193
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:10,059
I'll give them a nish ok so does anybody

1194
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,860
have any pressing questions this is like

1195
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:21,449
some of the best minds in the biz and

1196
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:25,240
they're like right in front of you I

1197
00:48:21,449 --> 00:48:27,819
mean we we've had they think three

1198
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:29,619
successive years of bills we've never

1199
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:35,350
actually gotten it out of the

1200
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:36,940
legislature the the reason being I mean

1201
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:38,289
when you talk about it it really does

1202
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,670
depend on what type of research you're

1203
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:41,019
talking about I guess just to be clear

1204
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:42,430
when you're talking about research on

1205
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:45,460
human subjects you're talking about a

1206
00:48:42,429 --> 00:48:47,079
very hyper regulated activity that we

1207
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:49,990
don't actually have the authority as a

1208
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:52,750
state to do when it comes to research on

1209
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:53,919
pesticides it's all going like all of

1210
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:56,260
the research that doesn't involve

1211
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,210
consumers is exploding right now and

1212
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,320
it's amazing but when it comes to human

1213
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:02,019
subjects we just don't have the

1214
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,640
authority at the state level I'd like to

1215
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:05,800
jump in and say something yesterday I

1216
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:09,309
was in Las Vegas for the day at a

1217
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:12,640
medical cannabis symposium and it was a

1218
00:49:09,309 --> 00:49:14,980
symposium with doctors and researchers

1219
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:18,509
from around the globe who are doing

1220
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:21,309
clinical trials involving cannabis and

1221
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:22,960
it was really eye-opening it was

1222
00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:25,179
probably I would say a couple hundred

1223
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,920
folks and everyone would present their

1224
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:29,529
research and talk about what they're

1225
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,880
doing in their respective country and it

1226
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:33,790
was interesting to hear about the

1227
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,860
barriers in the United States to

1228
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:38,320
research because of the scheduling of

1229
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:41,559
cannabis versus how things are in Greece

1230
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:44,410
or Canada or some other countries and it

1231
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:46,420
was really wonderful to have an

1232
00:49:44,409 --> 00:49:49,149
opportunity to also talk with these

1233
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:50,860
researchers and doctors and talk about

1234
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,500
how they can bring from a you know

1235
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:55,570
factually based perspective and through

1236
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:58,380
what they find through their research

1237
00:49:55,570 --> 00:50:00,580
how they can help create policy change

1238
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:04,690
internationally as relates to cannabis

1239
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:07,329
so that we can see you know a really

1240
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:09,220
well informed conversation around this

1241
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:11,170
so I know that doesn't speak to

1242
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:14,289
California but I just thought it was a

1243
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:16,820
quite quite a wonderful gathering of

1244
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:19,190
very smart minds that also showed

1245
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:23,450
how little the medical community how

1246
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:25,460
much research is is is limited because

1247
00:50:23,449 --> 00:50:27,710
of the status of cannabis in so many

1248
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:30,730
countries and certainly the US and and

1249
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:34,369
how that that community of brilliant

1250
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:36,440
intellectual healing folks are really

1251
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:39,109
just kind of at at their infancy so I

1252
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:40,610
hope for for that we entered into a new

1253
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:42,079
research model this year which was

1254
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:45,230
exciting which is a community driven

1255
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:48,230
research project and the CD RPS and

1256
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:50,929
people from UC Irvine and a few other

1257
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:52,940
universities are actually saying that

1258
00:50:50,929 --> 00:50:55,639
seems viable and they weren't worried

1259
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,740
about the you know the schedule of

1260
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:59,420
cannabis they were saying this is really

1261
00:50:57,739 --> 00:51:01,369
a community driven research project

1262
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:04,579
they're doing you know herbarium

1263
00:51:01,369 --> 00:51:06,739
pressings and testings but it's it's you

1264
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:23,960
know it's by the community for the

1265
00:51:06,739 --> 00:51:25,819
community that it serves so you you

1266
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,139
usually can't do it on the whole so you

1267
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:29,150
can't from what I heard from these

1268
00:51:27,139 --> 00:51:31,279
scientists is that you can't do it on

1269
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:33,680
the whole plant you can do it with

1270
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,900
certain compounds and depending on what

1271
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:37,519
the university research and institution

1272
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,789
allows and what the applicable laws are

1273
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:43,610
so it's very limited and then there's

1274
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:45,590
oversight by the feds so they show up to

1275
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:47,660
these doctors uh you know research

1276
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:49,400
institutions and look through everything

1277
00:51:47,659 --> 00:51:52,069
and make sure everything is a hundred

1278
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:55,539
percent you know legal to the extent you

1279
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:55,539
know that that whatever is required

1280
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:09,710
one or more chemicals whose isolation

1281
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:12,409
processes extraction processes I mean

1282
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:16,190
there's distillation there's a number of

1283
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:18,859
extraction methods you you turn the

1284
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:21,889
plant into a bunch of individual source

1285
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:26,090
chemicals and/or multiple chemicals in a

1286
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:29,179
compound and then research those can I

1287
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:32,390
ask a question I want to know what

1288
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:36,199
everybody including you Justin learned

1289
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:38,389
in 2018 what what did you expect but you

1290
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:40,939
didn't see or what did you not see that

1291
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:47,480
you expected to see in 2018 you only get

1292
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:49,220
one answer i I learned what I

1293
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,990
articulated on the last question that

1294
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:53,719
some folks see barriers to entry as a

1295
00:52:50,989 --> 00:52:57,500
good thing I I spent three years

1296
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:59,599
prepping for a bill that we ran that we

1297
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,940
ultimately lost because the industry was

1298
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,980
split on it it was a bill that would

1299
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,809
have allowed for sales to take place at

1300
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,880
an event like this it would have allowed

1301
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:09,289
growers to directly showcase their

1302
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:13,039
products and sell them directly to

1303
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:14,420
consumers I spent you know in 2014 I

1304
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,130
started the conversation with the

1305
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:18,380
narcotics Officers Association of

1306
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:19,849
America not joking sat down with their

1307
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,550
lobbyist and said yeah what's it gonna

1308
00:53:19,849 --> 00:53:23,989
take to get here by 2018 I thought we

1309
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:25,519
were there we had local government on

1310
00:53:23,989 --> 00:53:26,509
board we had law enforcement on board

1311
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:28,909
and you know what did it

1312
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:30,920
a group of retailers not the Southern

1313
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:33,859
California Coalition by the way these

1314
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:35,659
guys were solid couldn't quite get on

1315
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:38,030
board to support but hey you didn't

1316
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:40,399
fight us which honestly like we can

1317
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:43,880
disagree but the fact that we were lined

1318
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,710
up fighting with other businesses it was

1319
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,480
a real wake-up call for me I you know I

1320
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:49,639
grew up in a different world I didn't

1321
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,440
grow up where unrepentant self-interest

1322
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:53,059
was acceptable I grew up in a world

1323
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,920
where unrepentant self-interest was

1324
00:53:53,059 --> 00:54:01,219
immoral so that's what I learned in 2018

1325
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,530
I don't know if I'll earn this but it

1326
00:54:01,219 --> 00:54:05,629
was certainly reinforced and that's that

1327
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:08,298
nothing happens unless you make it

1328
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:10,010
happen you know you've got to get out

1329
00:54:08,298 --> 00:54:12,019
there and and you've got to be

1330
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:13,490
relentless about it and you've got to

1331
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:15,079
get in front of the people that you

1332
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:19,219
really don't want to be talking to and

1333
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:20,630
and sway them be persuasive and and

1334
00:54:19,219 --> 00:54:21,019
don't give up until you get what you

1335
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:38,059
want

1336
00:54:21,019 --> 00:54:41,530
simple as that I mean I guess I learned

1337
00:54:38,059 --> 00:54:41,530
I wasn't as smart as I thought I was

1338
00:54:41,588 --> 00:54:49,039
thanks Michael no I mean things came at

1339
00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:51,349
at me this year I mean that this shit

1340
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:53,509
comes at me every day and always has but

1341
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:58,730
this year it came at me from people that

1342
00:54:53,510 --> 00:55:00,470
I didn't think it was going to and you

1343
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:01,909
know people that have had the

1344
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:03,889
opportunity to come together for the

1345
00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:07,940
longest time seemed to do the cut the

1346
00:55:03,889 --> 00:55:11,929
nose despite the face thing and so I I

1347
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:16,220
feel like this year I learned I learned

1348
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:20,389
who my friends were you know and and you

1349
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:21,709
know and I and I and I'd be nice Hockman

1350
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:24,139
I learned I don't know it was like

1351
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:26,269
there's like an encyclopedia of what I

1352
00:55:24,139 --> 00:55:30,289
learned this year I haven't stopped

1353
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:33,579
learning like just just this week just

1354
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:36,230
this week I learned how can hard it is

1355
00:55:33,579 --> 00:55:37,970
for a small batch cultivator although

1356
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:41,750
all the shit we've done for the last

1357
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:45,409
three years to figure some of this stuff

1358
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:49,639
out just to get enough cannabis to maybe

1359
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:54,348
pay a week's worth of employees into the

1360
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:57,769
retail market was for us and that wasn't

1361
00:55:54,349 --> 00:56:00,920
that that was a laundry list Bobby thank

1362
00:55:57,769 --> 00:56:03,650
you because Bobby had the opportunity at

1363
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:06,710
many times to say dude I got a business

1364
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:09,530
to run really like you know that's it

1365
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:10,190
you know good good model I'm sure it's

1366
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:11,559
gonna work

1367
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:13,630
you know and

1368
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:16,660
watching how these brands enter into the

1369
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:19,689
marketplace and and what we've already

1370
00:56:16,659 --> 00:56:21,788
had to face with the Herculean licensing

1371
00:56:19,688 --> 00:56:23,259
with building and planning being against

1372
00:56:21,789 --> 00:56:24,849
us our own community against us our own

1373
00:56:23,259 --> 00:56:27,369
growers our neighbors against like all

1374
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:30,278
these things and then to and then to see

1375
00:56:27,369 --> 00:56:31,959
that like just to get a few grams to be

1376
00:56:30,278 --> 00:56:33,849
able to smoke outside which you're not

1377
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:37,328
supposed to smoke the crab's is so idle

1378
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:41,739
but whatever happened here today

1379
00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:43,749
just to have it happen here was I mean

1380
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:45,728
it was ridiculous and nauseating and

1381
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:46,389
tiring and I want to go to sleep I want

1382
00:56:45,728 --> 00:56:48,748
to take a nap

1383
00:56:46,389 --> 00:56:50,949
Michael wants to take a nap Bobby

1384
00:56:48,748 --> 00:56:52,448
probably wants to take a nap and anybody

1385
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:55,688
who's involved in the process so I

1386
00:56:52,449 --> 00:57:02,588
learned a lot about what we're really

1387
00:56:55,688 --> 00:57:06,548
facing you know so yeah I I learned the

1388
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:09,818
power of politics and politicians and

1389
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:12,938
local government especially I you know

1390
00:57:09,818 --> 00:57:15,009
when the mmrsa when when all those and

1391
00:57:12,938 --> 00:57:16,328
we was about to pass and then it passes

1392
00:57:15,009 --> 00:57:18,188
and then okay so what's the new

1393
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:20,048
landscape how do people run businesses

1394
00:57:18,188 --> 00:57:22,928
you have to have a local permit to get a

1395
00:57:20,048 --> 00:57:25,028
state license okay who are all these

1396
00:57:22,929 --> 00:57:26,619
local what are these local offices who

1397
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:28,239
are these elected officials what's the

1398
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:29,890
building and planning department

1399
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:32,409
what you know how do you like pulling

1400
00:57:29,889 --> 00:57:33,969
permits dealing with in the Bay Area we

1401
00:57:32,409 --> 00:57:35,278
dealt with that but in most of the rest

1402
00:57:33,969 --> 00:57:37,929
of the state you're not dealing with

1403
00:57:35,278 --> 00:57:40,150
local elected officials than these

1404
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:44,108
smaller little offices to go through a

1405
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:46,179
whole local entitlement process and it

1406
00:57:44,108 --> 00:57:48,429
is incredible to me that still I think

1407
00:57:46,179 --> 00:57:50,489
70 percent of local jurisdictions aren't

1408
00:57:48,429 --> 00:57:53,380
even issuing business licenses for

1409
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:56,170
cannabis companies and that in the 30

1410
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:58,568
percent that do it's usually incredibly

1411
00:57:56,170 --> 00:58:00,548
expensive incredibly politicized you

1412
00:57:58,568 --> 00:58:03,759
have to be so well capitalized I mean a

1413
00:58:00,548 --> 00:58:07,599
snapshot of the industry I had a coffee

1414
00:58:03,759 --> 00:58:09,519
with our the director of the department

1415
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:12,068
of cannabis regulation in the city of La

1416
00:58:09,518 --> 00:58:15,129
this last week and I told her snapshot

1417
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:17,170
of the industry the dispensaries in the

1418
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:19,239
city of La that are operating right now

1419
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:20,949
most of them are struggling because the

1420
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:22,298
illegal shops you've got the people who

1421
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:24,079
are waiting in line for licensing and

1422
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:25,909
you just kind of go down the line

1423
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:30,109
and it's struggle struggle struggle

1424
00:58:25,909 --> 00:58:33,318
struggle struggle and yet who are the

1425
00:58:30,108 --> 00:58:35,568
ones that make the choice for people to

1426
00:58:33,318 --> 00:58:37,190
get a license yeah it's the voters and

1427
00:58:35,568 --> 00:58:39,079
it's how we vote on these issues but we

1428
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:41,179
voted overwhelmingly for cannabis but

1429
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:43,818
then we also have communities who say

1430
00:58:41,179 --> 00:58:45,498
yeah not in my backyard so whether it's

1431
00:58:43,818 --> 00:58:47,778
through you know these neighborhood

1432
00:58:45,498 --> 00:58:50,838
councils or other kind of local groups

1433
00:58:47,778 --> 00:58:54,039
or the kind of local established offices

1434
00:58:50,838 --> 00:58:57,078
themselves no a lot of challenges

1435
00:58:54,039 --> 00:59:00,249
getting through those gatekeepers

1436
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:03,829
so really seeing into in the City of LA

1437
00:59:00,248 --> 00:59:06,199
into this whole political machine has

1438
00:59:03,829 --> 00:59:08,900
been incredibly eye-opening as well as

1439
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:12,018
in other jurisdictions across across the

1440
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:15,700
state so really the power of the the

1441
00:59:12,018 --> 00:59:29,088
power of all of that mind blowing brain

1442
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:32,328
exploding my biggest learning is how

1443
00:59:29,088 --> 00:59:36,409
quickly the cream rises to the top how

1444
00:59:32,329 --> 00:59:39,349
quickly in a time of turmoil a time of

1445
00:59:36,409 --> 00:59:43,129
change a time of indecision and the time

1446
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:46,400
of unknown the cream rises and you know

1447
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:49,329
as as my partner former partner used to

1448
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:52,160
say when the snow melts the shit shows

1449
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:55,130
the snows been melting for a while in

1450
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:57,949
this industry and just like everything

1451
00:59:55,130 --> 01:00:01,160
else it's starting to become clear who

1452
00:59:57,949 --> 01:00:03,680
your friends are who the good people are

1453
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:05,690
right anybody could be good when things

1454
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:07,788
are going well right it's the hard

1455
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:09,889
decisions the ones where you have to

1456
01:00:07,789 --> 01:00:11,749
make a trade-off that are the ones that

1457
01:00:09,889 --> 01:00:15,708
determine whether you know how to make

1458
01:00:11,748 --> 01:00:18,379
the right decision and then it turns

1459
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:20,690
into cottage cheese

1460
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:22,550
and off to the top it goes into the

1461
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:24,950
fridge where everyone enjoys it and then

1462
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:30,019
everyone's like we're gonna turn the

1463
01:00:24,949 --> 01:00:33,149
rest into cottage cheese so if you farm

1464
01:00:30,019 --> 01:00:38,059
I mean that's a long-lasting tarantula

1465
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:38,059
[Laughter]

1466
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:57,250
all right is there anybody else that has

1467
01:00:41,599 --> 01:01:09,049
another question I mean come on sure so

1468
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:12,369
first distributors are doing it

1469
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:15,350
themselves so direct distribution

1470
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:17,179
logistics only distribution where the

1471
01:01:15,349 --> 01:01:19,190
brand might have a sales team in the

1472
01:01:17,179 --> 01:01:20,750
market initiating the sales but then

1473
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:22,460
when it comes time to deliver it and

1474
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:24,889
collect the money that's happening with

1475
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:27,289
third party outfit and then full-service

1476
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:28,940
distribution which is you just drop your

1477
01:01:27,289 --> 01:01:32,449
product off at a warehouse and the

1478
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:37,190
selling and the testing and the delivery

1479
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:40,460
and the retail relations happens with

1480
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:42,740
that third party distributor I'm gonna

1481
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:44,360
give the mic back to Hezekiah I was

1482
01:01:42,739 --> 01:01:50,089
gonna see if you guys wanted to hear a

1483
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:51,860
poem so you know this is something I

1484
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:54,800
were a little bit ago actually a lot a

1485
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:56,329
bit ago thinking about legalization and

1486
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:58,280
thinking about what it would mean

1487
01:01:56,329 --> 01:02:01,549
anything is every bit as relevant now as

1488
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:03,290
it was then so even as felons my friends

1489
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:05,300
have grown and there's no telling when

1490
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:07,190
the change will come home sometimes I

1491
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:09,560
can't see through the haze and smoke

1492
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:12,440
sometimes I can't breathe and it makes

1493
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:13,759
me choke and there's no telling when the

1494
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,970
change will come home but I'm feeling

1495
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,240
that it's soon and it fills me with hope

1496
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:19,099
shit

1497
01:02:17,239 --> 01:02:22,389
fuck it I lost that you guys I'm sorry

1498
01:02:19,099 --> 01:02:22,389
we'll have to get high and do it outside

1499
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:27,169
well that was really kind of you

1500
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:28,519
all right so even as felons my friends

1501
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:30,889
have grown and there's no telling when

1502
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:32,780
the change will come home that's what I

1503
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:34,159
want to reiterate though is there's a

1504
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,869
lot of really good people that have done

1505
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:37,639
time there's a lot of really good people

1506
01:02:35,869 --> 01:02:40,100
that have had their lives ruined and

1507
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:41,329
shattered and as was noted 70% of

1508
01:02:40,099 --> 01:02:43,460
California still doesn't have

1509
01:02:41,329 --> 01:02:45,259
legalization seventy-five of the hundred

1510
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:47,329
most populous cities are still living in

1511
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:48,830
those shadows most of the cultivation

1512
01:02:47,329 --> 01:02:50,809
communities are still living in those

1513
01:02:48,829 --> 01:02:53,059
shadows when I started this work I

1514
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:56,869
realized that there were about 53,000 of

1515
01:02:53,059 --> 01:02:58,730
us there's less than 1,700 people who

1516
01:02:56,869 --> 01:03:00,590
have been licensed I want you all to

1517
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:02,750
realize that we have a lot of work to do

1518
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:04,780
the change hasn't come home we're lost

1519
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:07,099
we can't see through this haze and smoke

1520
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:09,019
but we are gonna get there if we do it

1521
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:10,639
together and that's why I really want to

1522
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:12,650
underscore the importance of cooperation

1523
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:14,420
the importance of working together and

1524
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:15,920
this isn't just about cannabis like

1525
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:18,260
we're on the verge of extinction you

1526
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,570
guys our planet is dying and we are

1527
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:22,460
killing it we are the reason for all of

1528
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:25,190
this we're going to need to work

1529
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:26,929
together if it's going to get better so

1530
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:28,579
let's go get high and take that first

1531
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:30,500
step and get started now if you're

1532
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:35,900
sowing clients no pressure though if you

1533
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:36,869
don't want it that's a perfect segue

1534
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:51,929
into a raffle

1535
01:03:36,869 --> 01:03:51,929
