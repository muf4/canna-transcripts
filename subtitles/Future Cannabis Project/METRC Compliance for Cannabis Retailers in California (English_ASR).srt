physicians and veterinarians I work

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,628
primarily with getting our stores ready

15
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,119
through licensing preparing the storage

16
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:50,849
for licensing we have received our

17
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,049
temporary license last year and February

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,210
we were one of the first stores here in

19
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:57,030
Los Angeles a alternative medicine group

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,070
and Green Cross and we are working on

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,850
getting our state full certification

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,978
which will come in in September at that

23
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,099
time we'll be requested to meet these

24
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:11,188
metric track and trace situation we're

25
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,079
currently right now we are handling our

26
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:14,489
manifests just like we should every time

27
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,469
we get an order in it's coming from

28
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,298
somebody who's legal and compliant we're

29
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:20,069
getting their COAS every single time

30
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,450
that we get an order but these were

31
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:24,298
actually protocols that we put in place

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,129
before January we were already working

33
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,700
with vendors that we knew were going to

34
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:31,618
be compliant and then in February we

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,109
were put in this situation where once we

36
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,879
got our license we couldn't buy product

37
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,438
really from anybody and our stores were

38
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,599
pretty empty yeah we were the first

39
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:43,109
stores to really be legally open in

40
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:46,319
February on February 5th when the stores

41
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:50,728
got their license prior to that we could

42
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:52,949
order from about 30 or 40 vendors which

43
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:55,618
was a massive reduction from who we

44
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,180
could order from prior to January so

45
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:58,109
we've been having these periods of time

46
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,189
where every time we go through

47
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:04,409
regulations we have an abrupt smaller

48
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:06,089
amount of product that I can buy for the

49
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,459
stores and that means less product for

50
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,039
the patients which also means less tax

51
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,740
revenue for the state so in February

52
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,349
that was a situation we we were met with

53
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,490
in July first a lot of people were taken

54
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:19,049
off-guard because everybody got

55
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,240
temporary extensions on all of these

56
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,400
things but they did not extend the the

57
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,629
packaging and lab testing requirements

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,789
which a lot of people had anticipated

59
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:27,930
that they would and that's one of the

60
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:29,969
issues that I see in the cannabis

61
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,700
industry is that we don't have foresight

62
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:36,419
into what is the me coming down the road

63
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:37,619
for us you may not think you may think

64
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:39,299
that they're gonna give you an extension

65
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,340
but you should always prepare that

66
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,050
they're not you that's the problem with

67
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,060
why stores were not prepared for July

68
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,350
first is because we were dealing with

69
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,629
vendors that were telling us that they

70
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,819
were going to be compliant however they

71
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:52,560
were not they weren't for packaging they

72
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,569
didn't have the lab testing the phase 2

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,670
lab testing and it put us all in a

74
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,379
situation where as of July 1st a lot of

75
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:00,299
stores had zero product and those were

76
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,250
stores that had no foresight they did

77
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,990
not prepare until the last week of June

78
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,909
like oh I can't sell my own product

79
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,379
anymore let's clear off all of our

80
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:09,509
product that we have so I don't have to

81
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,769
send any of it to be destroyed and then

82
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:11,969
we'll just buy product well that it

83
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,030
wasn't that easy everybody was already

84
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:22,229
cleared out of stock and so July 1st you

85
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:26,610
went from 30 so when we start on July

86
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:28,949
1st we probably had max eight to ten

87
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,280
vendors that we could that we had on our

88
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:34,319
shelves that we can work with some of

89
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,909
the brands that we had were island up

90
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,979
north floor cow for flour products and

91
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:45,240
then for product wise we had heavy

92
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:47,989
hitters for vapor pens pure vape and

93
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:51,629
tincture wise we had Popham Berkeley

94
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:54,780
edibles we had Kanako's so we had a

95
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:57,539
vendor for each category but the product

96
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,669
diversity was so minimal that people

97
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:01,560
were coming in the door on July 1st and

98
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,959
just terribly upset that you don't have

99
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,939
this so you don't have that and it's our

100
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,590
obligation to the patients and to the

101
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:09,719
customers to explain to them the reason

102
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,700
why is that they understand that their

103
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,430
voice can be heard as well not just as

104
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,529
angry with us but angry and you know

105
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,449
talk to your representatives talk to the

106
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,439
government go in place you know a lot of

107
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,019
people still don't want to come out of

108
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,269
the green closet but this is a situation

109
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,829
we're in and then we've made it through

110
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,299
each of these milestones and we have

111
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:30,149
survived every step of the way

112
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,098
and then here in September when we have

113
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:34,348
to go for our metric track and trace

114
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:36,930
training we'll have 30 days after that

115
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:38,579
to comply and to be completely on metric

116
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,930
which our point-of-sale system we've

117
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,750
switched to a point-of-sale system that

118
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,699
will be fully integrated into the system

119
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,470
however it's still our obligation to

120
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,930
verify that everything is in there

121
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,750
properly and we are going to be hiring

122
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,639
and training an individual that is going

123
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,519
to be our compliance specialist for the

124
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:59,038
store because there is no way that we

125
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,839
can put that on any employee that we

126
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,149
have right now without that proper

127
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,098
training in place and it is we have to

128
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:07,560
do our due diligence because even if my

129
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:09,689
employee makes a mistake I can't tell

130
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,889
this day oh my employee made a mistake I

131
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:16,110
let them go and you know please forgive

132
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,430
me it we're still fully responsible for

133
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,340
anything that any of our staff members

134
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,468
do here so we have to be compliance has

135
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,810
always been a huge issue for us because

136
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:26,218
we were a pre ICO property dispensary so

137
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,709
if we ever stepped outside of that we

138
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:31,459
could have our store shut down so I

139
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:34,019
think for us we have always kept

140
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:35,879
compliance as the foundation of how we

141
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:37,258
were moving forward in this in this

142
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,028
industry because it was the only way to

143
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,400
survive and that's why a lot of

144
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:43,740
companies have not I remember when we

145
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,848
passed legalization and they came out

146
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,168
and said you know 90 percent of the

147
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:48,389
companies that exist right now are not

148
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:50,430
going to exist into the future and I

149
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,460
believe that and I actually think that

150
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:57,439
that was not correct I think is like 95

151
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:57,439
percent what point of sale software

152
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:06,349
previous to being licensed we switch

153
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:09,379
from bio track to trees and there was

154
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,030
many reasons why we switched to trees to

155
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:13,550
meet a lot of the needs that we had for

156
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:15,379
a growing company we needed an inventory

157
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,840
system that was going to be integrated

158
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:21,110
into metric we needed an inventory that

159
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,918
we could do online menus and that was

160
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,919
going to be a lot more user friendly

161
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,810
than the system that we had I evaluated

162
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:31,250
multiple companies when we when we went

163
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,870
down that route and I can't every

164
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,569
company is growing every company is

165
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,879
learning from their mistakes and I feel

166
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,019
that trees is doing that another company

167
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,120
that I really recommend to people is

168
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:42,439
green bits I've been a big supporter of

169
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,590
them as well I think to have an awesome

170
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:46,519
team and an awesome platform but right

171
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:48,889
now that's what we're currently using

172
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,870
for our stores is trees because they

173
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:53,360
will also be metric track and trays

174
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,620
integrated to where at the end of every

175
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,270
night I'm not going to sit there and

176
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,129
have to upload all of ourselves to

177
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:59,859
metric the system should be doing that

178
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:03,019
automatically every 10 minutes the

179
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,000
requirements for us as a retailer for

180
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:06,680
corresponding information to metric is

181
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,509
at the end of every day we have to send

182
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,310
our cells that we have to the system

183
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:13,969
every two weeks we have to apply our

184
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:17,269
inventory to the system which the way

185
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:19,520
that we do is we do a we do a different

186
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:21,680
inventory every single day so either

187
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,418
it's vapor and extracts and we do that

188
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,900
so basically we will be supplying that

189
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:28,699
every week to the system and we have the

190
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:30,560
opportunity that trees will update that

191
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,629
information into the system to metric

192
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,759
and it's our responsibility if we want

193
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:37,189
that to go smoothly is to make sure that

194
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,409
we're always on point that we didn't

195
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:41,839
make any mistakes we've entered manifest

196
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:44,120
into the system and that is the point of

197
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,918
using a system as integrated as theirs

198
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,350
is that it will do a lot of that work

199
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:51,680
for us to where we are pretty much just

200
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,720
auditing it constantly and we are

201
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,189
required to send ourselves every single

202
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,560
day into the system some store

203
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:58,969
specifically in Colorado where there's a

204
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,459
little bit more time with some of this

205
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,930
is they have been sitting there for

206
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:04,579
hours at the end of the day just

207
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,400
uploading their sales into the system

208
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:09,500
and if one of those 24 digit numbers is

209
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:10,379
off it kicks back to the entire report

210
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,180
and then you have to go

211
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,100
through there and find out why this

212
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,540
number is incorrect and where it ended

213
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,280
up being incorrect is when it was

214
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,960
received into the system to where

215
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,819
somebody did not properly put in that

216
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,549
number and that's why it's kicking back

217
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:25,319
the report so for us our obligation

218
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,079
throughout the entire thing is to just

219
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,129
audit every step of the way to make sure

220
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,479
that the end of the night we have a

221
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,389
smooth transition to where we're

222
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,479
literally just closing out our system

223
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:38,370
closing out our drawers and go home and

224
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,690
where it's uploaded everything verify

225
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,460
everything's uploaded because if we have

226
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,140
one situation where it didn't upload we

227
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,610
are no longer compliant we are no longer

228
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:47,669
meeting metrics track and trace

229
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,120
standards and that puts our license at

230
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:51,629
risk

231
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,940
it's huge fines all for what are going

232
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:55,169
to be is very simple mistakes and that's

233
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,570
why I think it's very important for

234
00:08:55,169 --> 00:09:00,449
stores for every single cannabis company

235
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:03,150
right now having a new department built

236
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,560
just around compliance so things that

237
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:07,250
we've been doing to prepare for Mack

238
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:10,529
metric track and trace is obviously

239
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,059
inventories are crucial to our store

240
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:14,039
and we've been doing that since before

241
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:16,049
we even knew that metric track and trace

242
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,480
was going to be going into a vector when

243
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:20,879
it was going into effect a lot of stores

244
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,350
don't do inventory like they should be

245
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,799
they do well you know an all-over

246
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,769
inventory once a month or they they do a

247
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:31,949
half-assed job doing it and for us it's

248
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:34,049
I take my experience doing track and

249
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,940
trace basically with control drugs from

250
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:37,439
the veterinary world where we have to

251
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,870
send in a report every single month on

252
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,670
what is how much fentanyl we have and

253
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,830
where was it used and why do we have the

254
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:45,599
loss that we have I'm taking those

255
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,250
inventory best practices from the

256
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,990
veterinary world and then from retail

257
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,690
when we would do that in clothing when I

258
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,980
oversaw stores and retail and applying

259
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,360
them all into here and I think that

260
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,769
that's what I'm really excited about in

261
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,000
cannabis right now is now that we're

262
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,980
legalized we're starting to be able to

263
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,389
bring professionals from other

264
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,009
industries and bring their best

265
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:04,799
practices into that and that's what

266
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:07,559
we're integrating right now is I have my

267
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,059
cells managers from Nordstrom my

268
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,159
inventory manager has a strong

269
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:12,929
background in shipping and shipping

270
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,240
manifest so this is all going to be a

271
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:16,649
benefit to our store and we're taking

272
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,090
those best practices but we've been

273
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,980
doing a lot of this stuff for when we

274
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,019
require it when you ship me a product I

275
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,460
want to see your manifest I need to see

276
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,789
these type of things before manifest

277
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,620
even

278
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,689
and I you were not delivering anything

279
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,429
to my store without a paper invoice

280
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,990
without who it was going to without you

281
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,429
sending me your license beforehand and

282
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,680
it was in your file and every time you

283
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:36,149
bring me this it goes into your file and

284
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,859
we're going to be continuing to evolve

285
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:39,809
that system to where it's you know we're

286
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,129
going to be able to just scan it as soon

287
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,629
as it comes in the door and then we'll

288
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:44,610
have an e-version of it we'll have a

289
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:45,899
paper copy and just doing our due

290
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,370
diligence that every time we get an

291
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,840
order delivered we sit there and take

292
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,220
our time and count it out with a

293
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,540
delivery driver and I think that that's

294
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,090
been an issue in the past there's a lot

295
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:57,149
of delivery drivers you know just drop

296
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,830
it off and you don't they're just out

297
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:00,000
the door and we require that you come in

298
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,340
through the back door that you wear your

299
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,529
ID badge you check in at the front and

300
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,340
and that when you deliver the product

301
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,929
we're going to sit there and go through

302
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,180
every single one to make sure it matches

303
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:11,489
that manifest so that when we bring it

304
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:12,569
into our system that we haven't missed

305
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,490
the stuff there we're not putting

306
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,720
something in our system that isn't there

307
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,779
and then I'm gonna have to do an

308
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,180
inventory loss report here when we go to

309
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,879
the metric track and trace and honestly

310
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:26,099
it's keeping a tight inventory system to

311
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:28,259
where there's a checksum balance it's

312
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,600
not just one person checking you know

313
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:32,370
where if you count that it says that

314
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,040
we're supposed to have ten can of coke

315
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,240
cookies you make sure that there's ten

316
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,679
if there's not you have another person

317
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,210
count it to make sure where it's at and

318
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,019
just using those best practices from

319
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:44,790
other industries on inventory to to fit

320
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,850
ours because we're gonna be under such

321
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:50,069
tight control that no missing product is

322
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,870
going to be acceptable when I got into

323
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,420
this industry four years ago I was

324
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,730
shocked that we didn't have requirements

325
00:11:54,419 --> 00:12:00,209
on lab testing and that we did not have

326
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,370
requirements on packaging and we didn't

327
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,200
have requirements on tracking you know

328
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,750
if a product is grown with some chemical

329
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,850
in it we need to know where it ends up

330
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,649
at and even though you know everything

331
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,940
that's being track and traced if

332
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:13,559
something comes back that there's a

333
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,930
recall on it we know every single

334
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,699
product to every single patient to every

335
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:19,799
single customer that we need to contact

336
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,350
and I'm a big proponent of track and

337
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:24,209
trace I I feel like it is what is going

338
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,129
to professionalize this industry to move

339
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,860
us into a national and international

340
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:30,899
platform and that is where cannabis is

341
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,490
going it is going to be cumbersome it's

342
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,590
going to be difficult for us to all get

343
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,810
through learning how to use a new system

344
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,590
is anytime you have to learn any new

345
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:39,000
program

346
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,129
it's gonna be difficult that you just

347
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,028
have to go at it with confidence every

348
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,639
time you have a training opportunity

349
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:46,049
deal with it

350
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,399
explain it to your staff member so they

351
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:49,019
know more about it as well so

352
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,579
everybody's feeling confident with it

353
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,439
some of the things that I would like to

354
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,379
see with metric where it's gonna put us

355
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,680
into that same issue as January 1st and

356
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:00,960
February 5th for us and July 1st is that

357
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,609
here in September when I'm able to take

358
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,460
my track and trace training

359
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:07,200
I'll have 30 days to comply so does that

360
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,778
mean that at the end of that 30 days

361
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,550
that here in October I'm only going to

362
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:13,649
be able to purchase products from

363
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:15,750
vendors that I already have metric track

364
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:17,879
and trays and that is going to again

365
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,070
reduce the amount of product that I can

366
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,870
have on my shelves which will again

367
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,700
reduce the amount of tax revenue that

368
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:27,269
the city and the state are is gonna see

369
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,160
from cannabis taxes so for me what I

370
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,470
would know will penalize compliant

371
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,600
operators oh for sure it will definitely

372
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,430
it's just another penalty for us however

373
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,409
the way I like to think of it as is that

374
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:39,059
you know as being a pre ICO property

375
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:41,159
dispenser both of the stores are and

376
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:43,169
we've kind of gotten to have this in

377
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,689
this we're ahead of the curve in a lot

378
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:46,889
of ways we've gotten to to work in this

379
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,900
industry long enough that we should have

380
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:51,029
learned by now that this is how our

381
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,740
industry is going to continue to be it's

382
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:54,539
not going to be over in October it's not

383
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,940
going to be in January there's going to

384
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:58,829
be constant updates to this and I feel

385
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,839
that the state will see some of these

386
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:04,860
hindrances that they've put on us and

387
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,510
see that it's hurting to things it's

388
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,009
hurting patients and customers from

389
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:10,319
being able to get their medicine and

390
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:12,088
it's hurting tax revenue so I really do

391
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,070
hope that the regulator's see when we

392
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:15,570
start to move into Trekker track and

393
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,990
trace that they're just gonna set a date

394
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:21,150
in the future say January 1st 2019 we're

395
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:23,789
all on metric everybody's in the same

396
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:26,069
boat everybody grab a paddle let's swim

397
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:27,629
you know and I really do hope that that

398
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,860
is what's gonna happen however it

399
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:31,588
doesn't look like that and I'm not gonna

400
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,778
feel I'm not going to expect that to

401
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:34,980
happen because I feel that you know

402
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:37,080
we're gonna be presented with the same

403
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,370
thing so right now what I'm doing is I'm

404
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,020
working with all of my vendors now

405
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,940
updating their files on when do you

406
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,250
expect for you to be moving into track

407
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,220
and trace so I know who to order at what

408
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:50,220
times because it's not I'm also the sole

409
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,490
buyer for AMG and I oversee buying for

410
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,278
grain

411
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,769
cross and without product our store

412
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,000
can't be open and that's where a lot of

413
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,559
stores are currently at right now is

414
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,820
they just were not ready for July first

415
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,439
and that's why they have no flour on

416
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,270
their shelves or they have no product on

417
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,649
their shelves and they're having to shut

418
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:07,049
down temporarily while they get these

419
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:08,639
products in and I think that's what's so

420
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:10,528
important also about networking in our

421
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,490
industry is making sure that you're

422
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:13,919
getting out there and you're going to

423
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,230
events and that you are going to you

424
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,338
know available training seminars so that

425
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,080
you can meet people in this industry

426
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:22,529
that are going do you have product

427
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,660
available for you may even possibly be

428
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:27,929
your next compliant officer for your

429
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:30,149
company and I really do hope that the

430
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:33,599
state feels what we're going through

431
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:36,570
right now in regards to they're gonna

432
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,120
see the tax revenue drop from just this

433
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,620
month alone because no stores are having

434
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,929
they are able to sell what they would

435
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,940
normally be selling I also hope that

436
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:46,620
they see that you know on average they

437
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,180
were saying each manufacturer had over

438
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,970
two hundred thousand dollars worth of

439
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:52,259
product that were unable to move well

440
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,120
that's two hundred thousand dollars

441
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:55,919
worth of product for them that equates

442
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,528
to forty eight thousand dollars worth of

443
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:01,199
excise tax revenue that equates to over

444
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:03,750
twenty thirty thousand and basically tax

445
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,790
revenue for the city on medical and or

446
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,940
adult use taxes and that was a

447
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:10,230
significant pain that each manufacturer

448
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,430
is feeling right now in the state is

449
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,100
gonna feel it that way

450
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:17,009
I hope that they're able to see like we

451
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,629
need to make a extensions at times when

452
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,970
they're needed but at the same time

453
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:23,189
let's get through this together we'll

454
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,870
move forward and when we get into metric

455
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,610
track and trace we do that together as

456
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,049
well you know I think that a lot of

457
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,129
people are really scared of it happening

458
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:30,299
and they don't want to learn about it

459
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:32,610
because they're scared of it and it's

460
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:34,859
time to just like just suck it up you're

461
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,149
a pioneer in this industry and keep

462
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,278
doing that if not you're gonna get left

463
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:41,070
behind as I have with countless friends

464
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:43,289
and colleagues and companies they have

465
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,750
been left behind because they were too

466
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:47,399
scared to really move forward with how

467
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,559
do I get licensed how do I get my

468
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,059
permits how do I get a distributor

469
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,889
license or work with a distributor who

470
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,599
to work with and that's what this

471
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:55,230
industry the the regulations are

472
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,700
cleaning that up

473
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,430
you know before I'd have to set a

474
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,810
meeting with a with a vendor so that I

475
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:02,009
could ask them everything from how was

476
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:02,869
your product cultivated from the

477
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:05,259
beginning

478
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,609
what you know what is your lab testing

479
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:08,869
where you know basically all of these

480
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,279
standards that I set in place and now

481
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:11,838
with these new regulations it's a lot

482
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,609
easier for me you can go ahead and send

483
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,588
me all of your license all of your lab

484
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,849
testing results all of your menus to

485
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:20,539
where I don't necessarily need to have a

486
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:21,769
sample of your product to be able to

487
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,170
know that this is going to be safe for

488
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:26,328
my patients just as there is an issue

489
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,640
right now with getting compliant and

490
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:30,700
quality products on our shelves there's

491
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,570
going to be a big issue with finding

492
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,640
people that want to work in our industry

493
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:38,419
or that already work in an industry want

494
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,650
to come to California too to help us

495
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,900
with this that we can hire on is our

496
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,120
compliance officer for our stores and

497
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,710
for our companies and there's going to

498
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:48,769
be a you know that's definitely going to

499
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,690
be a demand for those individuals and

500
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:53,900
that it's also something that a lot of

501
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:55,460
stores are not budgeting into their into

502
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,190
their annual budget is bringing on

503
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,110
somebody with that kind of ability and

504
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,210
it's something that our industry here in

505
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:05,209
California doesn't do a good job of is

506
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,700
is keeping people on their their payroll

507
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,440
but you know this is something that for

508
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,519
a long time where it's paid cash at the

509
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,330
end of every day we do not build our

510
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:19,339
workforce to be a place where we foster

511
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:21,199
the type of environment that is for

512
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:23,119
productivity you know we don't offer

513
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,740
health insurance we don't offer paid

514
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,389
vacations we don't do a lot of these

515
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,039
things and this is going to kind of

516
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,480
force us to step outside of that because

517
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:32,569
these individuals that are professionals

518
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,890
in Colorado and other states are getting

519
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,089
those type of benefits and if they're

520
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,309
going to be willing to move to a state

521
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:40,549
such as California with such a high cost

522
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:42,529
of living and taxes we're going to have

523
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:44,269
to pay for that and but it's also going

524
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:46,279
to be a necessary requirement you need

525
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:48,558
to have somebody who can do this and we

526
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,879
need to do our due diligence on finding

527
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,279
those individuals so I'm a big proponent

528
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,890
of LinkedIn I'm a big proponent of

529
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:56,359
networking because this is where you're

530
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:59,179
going to find those individuals a

531
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:02,389
majority of the time my hiring practices

532
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,890
I usually do a group interview and then

533
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,330
a one-on-one interview and then I do a

534
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,100
working interview where you come in and

535
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:08,629
we just you get to meet with all the

536
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:10,099
staff members and kind of see what your

537
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,560
job is going to be and make sure that

538
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:14,449
the entire staff is cool because anytime

539
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,500
you add somebody to the team it causes a

540
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,930
staff dynamics

541
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,190
shift and that's what we need to be

542
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,779
looking into when we're going to be

543
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,880
bringing on another manager is basically

544
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:25,099
what a compliance management officer is

545
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,240
going to be for our stores we need to

546
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:28,609
know that they're going to fit with our

547
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,740
current methods or we need to change our

548
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:32,929
current methods to meet their standards

549
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,430
because this is going to be the

550
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,590
foundation of our industry moving

551
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,779
forward if we do not have somebody that

552
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:41,059
we can fully trust and that is doing

553
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:42,319
their job and it may be that we hire

554
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:44,269
somebody that with the experience from

555
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,950
out of state it may be that we hire

556
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:48,470
somebody with it from another industry

557
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:52,009
that is able to have the critical

558
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:53,180
thinking skills to develop a metric

559
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:55,069
track and trace version of what they

560
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,330
were doing and that is what we're going

561
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:58,039
to be doing it's what we're going to be

562
00:19:56,329 --> 00:20:00,169
finding every single one of our

563
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,970
directors four four stores or four

564
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,850
companies needs to be just as competent

565
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:07,910
in metric track and trace as their

566
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:10,399
officer and that Officer also needs to

567
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:12,080
train have a an assistant to because we

568
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,750
are going to have to give these officers

569
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,519
a break and a vacation and they can't

570
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,839
always be there and that's something

571
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,519
that our industry has a hard time too

572
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,869
it's like we find somebody who works

573
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,240
hard and works long hours and then we

574
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:25,339
work them to death and then they they

575
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,200
have poor work productivity after the

576
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:28,970
first year and then we lose them and we

577
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,400
got to hire another workhorse basically

578
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,799
and so it's going to make us have to

579
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,330
professionalize our working standards

580
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,129
and one of the things that I really try

581
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:38,839
to implement is a more European business

582
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,480
model to where we have you have

583
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:43,159
quarterly breaks you have you know I

584
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,720
would love to implement health insurance

585
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,060
for our staff to where they can just

586
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,890
focus on being happy and healthy and

587
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:51,049
happy healthy people are the most

588
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:54,140
productive people my personal movement

589
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:57,289
in cannabis is to make it a place that

590
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,960
really fosters what the cannabis plant

591
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:02,119
is about is about homeostasis finding

592
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,549
that balance to where you can have your

593
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:06,229
own life and still come into work and

594
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:08,049
take your time and to rejuvenate because

595
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,490
every time you come back from a vacation

596
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:11,930
you feel back you come back and recharge

597
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,700
and you were able to look at your work

598
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:15,470
from a different perspective so I really

599
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,400
do hope that with metric track and trace

600
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,009
and all of these things it's just

601
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,690
pushing us forward and making us more

602
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:22,789
professional and there was going to be

603
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,809
people left behind and there's going to

604
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:25,460
be stores that are going to shut down

605
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:28,908
and there are going to be companies that

606
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:32,778
do not make it into this next realm but

607
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:36,229
you got a fight what what what are the

608
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:37,848
requirements for who on your team you do

609
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:39,048
put through the metric training and then

610
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:41,319
what are you gonna do are you gonna do

611
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:43,668
more than that number of people so

612
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:45,710
currently for both of my stores we have

613
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:49,549
a full management team of an inventory

614
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:53,960
manager a sales manager a purchasing

615
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:55,368
manager to where and to where each one

616
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,288
of those individuals we're gonna push

617
00:21:55,368 --> 00:21:58,819
through metric where we're going to make

618
00:21:57,288 --> 00:22:01,999
sure everybody is metric on our

619
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:03,798
management team so that matric training

620
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:06,649
so that make sure that every single one

621
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:08,720
of them is able to give information to

622
00:22:06,648 --> 00:22:09,738
the other one so like in college we I

623
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,028
know a lot of people hate working on

624
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:12,889
group projects but I always felt like

625
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:14,419
the classes I did best on is where I had

626
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:16,848
a core group of people that I was with

627
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:18,440
that we would divide up the work and

628
00:22:16,848 --> 00:22:20,089
then we would cross train each other on

629
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,590
it and I feel like that's what we're

630
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,178
going to do here is each one of them

631
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:24,918
brings their each one of my management

632
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:26,749
team each one of my members of my

633
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:28,999
management team brings a special to the

634
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:30,618
special specialty to the group that

635
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:31,700
they're going to look at this from a

636
00:22:30,618 --> 00:22:33,199
different angle and we're going to be

637
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,069
able to train each other and think that

638
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,278
that's where we're actually having

639
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:38,450
issues right now as is just the the

640
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:43,038
interpretation of the new regulations

641
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:44,298
they came out so just Matt you know just

642
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,069
written down to where everybody's

643
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:47,598
interpreting differently it's in my

644
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:49,608
comparison is it's like it's like the

645
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:50,808
Bible where it's this person is

646
00:22:49,608 --> 00:22:52,848
interpreting over here and so I've got

647
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:54,168
some Roman Catholics over here I got

648
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:55,970
some Jehovah Witnesses running around

649
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:58,580
over here you know everybody's

650
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:01,848
interpreting these the this regulations

651
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:03,228
as as their Bible as though this is the

652
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:05,918
way it has to be or this is the way it

653
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:07,788
has to be and there hasn't been a lot of

654
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,859
oversight from the government saying no

655
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:11,058
no this is how it is because in a lot of

656
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:12,589
ways the government is learning they're

657
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:15,499
they're interpreting it their own way

658
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:16,728
with their own preconceived notions so

659
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:20,329
what I'm going to do is I'm pushing

660
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:21,798
myself all of my management team is

661
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:23,478
going to be going through training we

662
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:26,028
will have a compliance officer for each

663
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:27,440
store and that is how we're going to be

664
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:29,358
moving forward with metric and every

665
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,249
single employee is going to be added to

666
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:33,019
their training manuals where they are

667
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:34,819
going to understand which metric is and

668
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:36,079
why the importance of doing their due

669
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:38,118
diligence when they're doing inventory

670
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,439
and when they're selling product and

671
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:41,118
when they give the receipt to the

672
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,150
patient verifying that every single

673
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:44,669
product on their

674
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:47,340
is what you are giving to that person so

675
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,529
even the bud tenders will have some sort

676
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:50,909
of training maybe not the full metric

677
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:54,480
course but at least in their training

678
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:57,060
manual yes the the foundation of our

679
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,490
store and our training for every

680
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:01,859
employee here is compliant so every

681
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:03,630
single employee with the stores will be

682
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,819
going through that avery even with our

683
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:08,700
security companies we will apply they

684
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:11,460
will have a training manual a training

685
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,080
portion added to their manual over what

686
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,630
is tracking trays so that they know what

687
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,879
their responsibility is when we have a

688
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,290
vendor coming to the store or when

689
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,610
patients are leaving and how they're

690
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:23,250
leaving the store with their product

691
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:25,439
every single person in our store will be

692
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,900
briefed on it and will be trained in the

693
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,759
way that fits their position best some

694
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,220
individuals will have significantly more

695
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,140
training and some individuals will have

696
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,370
it understanding of how the product

697
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,230
leaves a store and how it's in the store

698
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:38,789
and how you do inventories but everybody

699
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,230
will have metric added to their training

700
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:42,029
and that's something I actually don't

701
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,620
see with stores very often is that they

702
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:45,809
actually have training manuals or

703
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:47,699
training modules for their patients to

704
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:49,799
to work I mean for their patient

705
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,140
consultants to work with and that's

706
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:53,839
something that I'm big on SOPs I brought

707
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,400
that from the veterinary world is is

708
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,929
standard operating procedure development

709
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,269
a lot of stores don't have this for

710
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:02,610
regarding this is how we do every step

711
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:04,589
by step by step from our management team

712
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:06,449
to our employ all of the employees how

713
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:08,129
you clean the restroom how you do

714
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,080
inventory how you sell a product

715
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,400
everything needs to be streamlined so

716
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,289
that when we bring on a new employee

717
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,850
it's not like the bet the old days where

718
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:16,109
it's just like to get them on the floor

719
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:17,849
and just see how they do and see how

720
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:20,039
they can do it's like it's not that any

721
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,869
more you know training takes a full 30

722
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:24,990
days for every employee before we let

723
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:27,089
them go on on solo I just really look

724
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,339
forward to this next this next chapter

725
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:30,980
in cannabis history I feel like we are

726
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:33,539
about to launch to a national platform

727
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:36,539
metric is going to assist on making a

728
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:39,329
national platform so that when we're

729
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:42,029
able to sell California cannabis all

730
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:44,309
over the country that we know where it

731
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:46,319
came from this is what metric is doing

732
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:49,230
for us and though metric was built on us

733
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,750
to track strawberries in Florida many

734
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:54,720
years ago it is now grown into the

735
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,130
system that is going to allow us to have

736
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,558
a

737
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:00,230
properly regulated national cannabis

738
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:01,579
market and soon after that international

739
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,259
cannabis market and like what we're

740
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:05,089
seeing in Humboldt County where they

741
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:07,400
have sick ba which is their version of

742
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:08,928
metric it's a way for them to track

743
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,690
everything that's coming from Humboldt

744
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:14,059
you know the champagne of champagne is

745
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,160
basically what Humboldt is and it's

746
00:26:14,058 --> 00:26:17,750
going to allow us to make sure that we

747
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,820
know where every product came from that

748
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,130
if you're selling product on a shelf in

749
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:24,019
a store in Texas that says it's

750
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,990
California cannabis you know for a fact

751
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:28,970
it was grown in California and

752
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:30,859
California has always been the biggest

753
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,450
producer for the United States for

754
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:33,918
cannabis so I'm just really looking

755
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,288
forward to us going national and

756
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,720
international and metric is a component

757
00:26:36,288 --> 00:26:40,099
to making all of that happen and if you

758
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,429
don't jump on it you're going to get

759
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,428
left behind

760
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:52,940
you

761
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:52,939
