1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,429
hello we're here today at the science of

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,880
organic regenerative cultivation

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:10,080
conference in southern Humboldt

4
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:13,469
California deep in the heart of the

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,500
redwoods also known as the cannabis

6
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:19,289
heartland and I'm Craig Johnson and

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:25,289
we're here today with a couple fellow

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:29,160
farmers my name is Jared and this is my

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:34,439
wife Angela Jared and Angela caught my

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,869
eye the first day of the conference one

11
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:41,000
of the presenters was up there and I saw

12
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:43,049
Jared signing and I thought that was

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,420
something that we're definitely missing

14
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:46,949
and I didn't even realize you know we

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,760
think we have all these other barriers

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:55,020
to entry with the cannabis world but I

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,698
didn't think about the barriers of not

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:03,510
hearing the words and the information

19
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:05,969
that is being shared it's really nice

20
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:08,099
that we're able to come here and come

21
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:11,640
educate ourselves and the information

22
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:15,890
that's here and she says and trying to

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:19,978
help create a language for it I mean it

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:22,079
she says the words match the pictures of

25
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:23,640
what's actually helped there happening

26
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,789
in the world and helping them get a

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,689
better picture of the cannabinoids you

28
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,270
know the molecules being stuck together

29
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:39,298
that she says and trying to develop a

30
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:41,099
language that we're using it and we're

31
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,409
testing it out to see how it works

32
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:46,609
and if it helps her understand better

33
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:52,140
and it really does help and it says

34
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:56,609
without the language it I I don't feel

35
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,649
like I'm able to to understand it so it

36
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:01,618
should be able to I need to be able to

37
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:06,259
develop that for our cannabis industry

38
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:09,538
and the science behind it it's important

39
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:12,318
one thing I noticed you started to spell

40
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:18,289
cannabinoid

41
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:21,798
I would imagine with a lot of words like

42
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:26,030
cannabinoid terpenes endocannabinoid

43
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:30,950
system i and now you didn't spell could

44
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:33,560
you explain that a little bit she says

45
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:36,259
when I started spelling she's is it it

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,878
just throws everything off like I can't

47
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:41,090
understand what we're talking about I

48
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:43,729
leaves me 8 she says the point is just

49
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,789
to have the language so it can flow

50
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:48,848
smoothly you know so we can have the

51
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:59,739
conversation and I can understand it

52
00:02:48,848 --> 00:03:00,979
how would you say regenitive maybe the

53
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:05,480
future

54
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:10,009
I don't know okay and I have I have

55
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:12,888
another one to ask you and that is you

56
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:16,789
know in my mind the sign to go burn one

57
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:20,739
would be this what is your sign or is

58
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:20,739
there a correct sign or a slang sign

59
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:33,590
it's more slang it's not really

60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,560
appropriate to for cannabis the sign for

61
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,169
smoking this is very very obvious to

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,359
everybody around that you're trying

63
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:45,680
isn't to go get high you want to be

64
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:47,930
discreet so cannabis you know the

65
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,989
outline of the heart and that's more

66
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:57,859
accurate portrayal that's amazing I love

67
00:03:50,989 --> 00:04:02,389
that so you guys are here at the

68
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:05,840
conference learning and sharing where's

69
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:07,400
your farmer or where do you even have a

70
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,310
cannabis farm or just vegetable farm

71
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:17,478
what are you guys up to see we're in

72
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:21,129
Southern Oregon applegate Valley you

73
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:24,769
said we have a medical grow on a farm

74
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:25,909
it's quality medicine and we built an

75
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:29,740
ecosystem

76
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:32,870
and we feed plants the earth and water

77
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,370
she says we have vegetables but lots of

78
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,189
different type of vegetables and herbs

79
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:41,120
and flowers in our gardens it's all

80
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:43,730
companion crops mm-hmm and keep bad bugs

81
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,730
away and keep the good bugs around you

82
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:50,870
know the integrated pest management

83
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:56,390
amazing amazing well thank you folks for

84
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:59,870
sharing and she says you're more than

85
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:02,329
happy and you're welcome and hopefully

86
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:08,840
next year we can have someone signing

87
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:14,329
the entire conference and you can maybe

88
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:17,299
share an update on your work well the

89
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:20,389
work doesn't happen without people like

90
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,259
you and me and others here because we

91
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:24,529
can't do it alone

92
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:27,500
I mean we're deaf we're a group of deaf

93
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:30,919
people I need mean voices for the

94
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,560
voiceless that without that support and

95
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,140
this opportunity never happens that made

96
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,720
me think of another thing is there a

97
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:41,149
farmer group or is there a group or a

98
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,860
website you can direct us to to get more

99
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:52,969
people involved from the the side and

100
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:56,540
the deaf community side she says we're

101
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:58,970
using a lot more resources to help get

102
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:03,260
the word out pieces and raise awareness

103
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:05,510
in that in the world and to be able to

104
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:08,930
share this information with this world

105
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:11,480
is such it's a unique opportunity and to

106
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,639
be able to build a farm with them and

107
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,340
show them how to do it

108
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:20,149
hands-on how to build an ecosystem and

109
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:22,369
about pollinators and just everything

110
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:26,089
that goes into it the bugs integrated

111
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:28,280
pest management teas fermentations I

112
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:31,369
mean and to be able to share that

113
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:33,469
opportunity maybe one day our hope is to

114
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,780
be able to have a rec garden where we

115
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,820
can fly the deaf people in from all over

116
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:40,849
the world where they can come here and

117
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:43,279
can learn how to be able to firm organic

118
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:45,890
medicine you know and just do it from

119
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:50,779
nature and work with us in a symbiotic

120
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:54,759
relationship you know it's beautifully

121
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:54,759
said and what's the name of your farm

122
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:02,900
mmm homegrown organics she says it's a

123
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:07,519
combination a couple different words she

124
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:11,329
says are X and then Oregon so and then

125
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:14,959
organic in sign language it's homegrown

126
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:17,300
or X so it's the Oregon this is sign for

127
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,969
Oregon yep and then you throw out the R

128
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,300
and X nice I'll have to work on that one

129
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:27,170
a little bit so one one sign of the time

130
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:29,750
it's deaf community oh that brings me to

131
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:32,350
another question is it just the two of

132
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,389
you or is your community among

133
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:37,840
partnerships like this you know is there

134
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:40,849
more of you together up there

135
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:44,329
mmm she says I have a small circle of

136
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:46,250
deaf friends that I grew up with that we

137
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:48,589
came they come and they helped us and

138
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,500
we've been learning together how to be

139
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:52,489
able to grow at our home and it's been a

140
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,040
really nice field to have that

141
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,410
experience to be able to share that

142
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,689
she's the other deaf friends that live

143
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:02,720
up there in the state will go to

144
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:06,879
dispensaries and they would drop off

145
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,860
flour for us when we're still available

146
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:14,449
to a legal medical market and they had

147
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,730
come down to harvest and learn how to

148
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:19,009
bail the soils and make those tight and

149
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,970
compost teas and how to be able to trim

150
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:24,139
how to cure you know package process

151
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,090
she's yeah

152
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:27,860
she says the business of it and try to

153
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:30,500
interpret the laws and the rules that

154
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,250
they are evolving this is there's so

155
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,668
much that to do

156
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:41,370
she says the deaf community is very

157
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:44,559
detailed its quality in their work

158
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:47,049
beautiful beautiful well thank you guys

159
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,969
for sharing your story and we'll

160
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:52,209
probably connect again I would say

161
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:59,220
whether it's through your network that

162
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:59,220
you're sharing with us or next year

163
