it's a joy to be here with you this

7
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:38,640
morning to talk about the state of

8
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:42,238
retail and distribution I want to let

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,230
folks know that Joe Devlin and I Joe

10
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:49,828
sitting right here to to my left he and

11
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:53,429
I just got back from Denver last night

12
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:56,250
we were a part of a delegation that went

13
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,780
to go check to see what was going on in

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,750
the city of Denver in the state of

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,049
Colorado and and one of the things that

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,450
I most appreciated about that trip is

17
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,359
that although Denver in the state of

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,640
Colorado have been doing this this

19
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:15,209
cannabis legalization and regulation for

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,109
six years or so I look to Joe and I said

21
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:21,509
we're not that far off and there are

22
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:23,399
issues that we are tackling that the

23
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,560
city of Denver and the state of Colorado

24
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:29,009
have not even begun to scratch the

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,469
surface and so I'm very excited to be

26
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,030
able to share and hear from panelists I

27
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:34,950
actually appreciate being in this

28
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,649
position and being able to moderate so

29
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,109
thank you Susan I'm normally the one who

30
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:43,469
gets asked 300 questions a day so this

31
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:46,649
will be nice for me to get a chance to

32
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:49,349
be the one asking the questions but I

33
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,140
have an excellent group of panelists

34
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:55,109
here today who are going to share

35
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,960
information about their experiences and

36
00:01:55,109 --> 00:02:00,478
and what the last nine months has really

37
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:04,408
meant for the state of California in

38
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:07,078
terms of retail or distribution I do

39
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,689
want to ask my fellow panelists to take

40
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:12,810
about one to two minutes to introduce

41
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:16,349
yourself let folks know who are here who

42
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,060
you are and what you do as it relates to

43
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:20,549
retail or distribution we'll start with

44
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,709
you Joe my name is Joe Devlin I'm the

45
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:24,329
chief of cannabis policy and enforcement

46
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,759
for the city of Sacramento and what that

47
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:28,799
means is in a nutshell I've been

48
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,479
responsible for putting forward all the

49
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:32,460
policy recommendations for the council

50
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,530
as it relates to the

51
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,800
of Sacramento's regulatory

52
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:41,099
infrastructure we also do all the

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,890
processing and and permitting for the

54
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:46,019
local cannabis businesses in addition to

55
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:48,569
that we also do the enforcement side of

56
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,180
things as well of legal cannabis

57
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:54,719
businesses I've been in my job for about

58
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,280
18 months now prior to that I worked for

59
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,810
the City Council and helped and helped

60
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,509
create the office and create the

61
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:05,699
position and then I liked the job so

62
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:09,359
much that I applied for it so thanks Joe

63
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:13,339
I'm Eric Spitz I'm the founder and CEO

64
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:17,460
of c4 distro we started this company in

65
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,289
2016 with the idea of helping the

66
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,070
cannabis industry move from backpack to

67
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:22,859
briefcase

68
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,409
what we like to say we have 35 people

69
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,690
who focus their attention servicing

70
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:31,379
producers and retailers in Southern

71
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:33,449
California so we covered 260 plus stores

72
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:36,449
all the legal stores in Southern

73
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:40,319
California with a field staff of about

74
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:42,989
20 people a back office infrastructure

75
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,840
as well as a warehouse staff and a set

76
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:49,710
of drivers and what we are trying to do

77
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,990
is help the industry really get to a

78
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:55,560
place where other industries are which

79
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:59,310
is a fluid and working logistics path

80
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,280
and supply chain and I have experienced

81
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,780
in the beer industry operated a media

82
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,689
company and have been starting companies

83
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,539
for the last 20 years so this is really

84
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:12,689
for me a coming home to an industry that

85
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:16,469
is in a wonderful spot I look forward to

86
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:18,839
talking to the panel and cat and really

87
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,640
helping all of you guys understand what

88
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:25,500
we're facing so that we can share and

89
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,839
grow together thank you Eric my name is

90
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,829
jarred Kyllo I'm the president of the

91
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:33,149
United canvas Business Association we

92
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:35,039
originated here in Los Angeles working

93
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:37,949
with pre ico property compliant

94
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,689
retailers we now represent about half of

95
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:41,879
the retailers here in Los Angeles and

96
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:43,350
about 25% of the retailers throughout

97
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,350
the state we've kind of moved into a

98
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,420
state legislative committee

99
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,580
as an organization organization

100
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,350
represents retail almost exclusively but

101
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:53,629
we also have five distribution partners

102
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,129
we felt like understanding the supply

103
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:58,159
chain was going to be really important

104
00:04:55,129 --> 00:05:00,230
in moving through regulations and having

105
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,220
you know good relationships with the

106
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,830
people who are going to be delivering

107
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,690
products to us and since I think most of

108
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:07,310
the people in my organization as

109
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:08,990
retailers have had a lot of experience

110
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,129
with cultivators throughout the years

111
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,439
because they've been operating in Los

112
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:14,659
Angeles for up to a decade I also own

113
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,149
the higher path in Sherman Oaks which is

114
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,830
just in the valley here and it's been

115
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:20,389
nice because of my experience in

116
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:22,009
Northern California running retail up

117
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:23,629
there and also kind of being part of the

118
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:25,459
Medical Marijuana task force up in San

119
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:27,379
Francisco it was nice to come to Los

120
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,969
Angeles and really try to find the

121
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:32,449
organization that really seemed like it

122
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,740
it was necessary to move what was kind

123
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:36,019
of a chaotic

124
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,750
I guess regulations in LA to something a

125
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:40,639
lot more clear and concise and and also

126
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,930
with the with the help and leadership of

127
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,189
Katt it's been a it's been a nice

128
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,709
experience I mean you look at Los

129
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:47,930
Angeles having more retail licenses than

130
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:50,149
any other municipality so it's a heavy

131
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,560
lift to be here in Los Angeles it's also

132
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,389
a heavy lift because we have a lot of

133
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,009
illegal operators or at least people who

134
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:58,610
are unregulated so trying to find that

135
00:05:55,009 --> 00:06:00,620
balance has been a Herculean task for

136
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,879
everyone in Los Angeles so I appreciate

137
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,139
everyone coming out today to try to

138
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:05,149
listen to some of the hardships we have

139
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:07,579
as retailers and distributors but also

140
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:09,379
some of the conclusions and solutions we

141
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:11,569
have but I think some of it's going to

142
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:13,399
take a cohesive group to kind of fight

143
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,899
for the same things and for us to come

144
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:16,489
with really good solutions that kind of

145
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:21,439
help everybody so that's where we're at

146
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:24,710
thank you it's good morning everyone

147
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:28,009
I am pleased to be here today my name is

148
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:30,289
Pamela Epstein with my fellow panelists

149
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:33,529
and I am the owner and founder of green

150
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:36,740
Weis companies we have a consulting

151
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:39,889
company and a law firm so they work

152
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:42,050
together to help operators along the

153
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:45,289
supply chain specifically we work with

154
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,870
dispensaries and distributors about how

155
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,780
you navigate this complex and

156
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,540
ever-changing regulatory framework that

157
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:56,418
we have here in California and a lot of

158
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,540
that comes to the bedrock foundations of

159
00:06:56,418 --> 00:07:00,909
good contract drafting

160
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,010
agreement how people interface together

161
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,530
because as we'll talk about the best

162
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:09,939
time to go through the difficult terms

163
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:11,709
and to plan for what may happen is when

164
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:15,189
everybody gets along and has the same

165
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:16,989
endgame which is to be profitable and

166
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:19,029
successful in this very complicated

167
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,579
market so I enjoy being able to work

168
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:23,979
with operators through the process we

169
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:25,899
take them through the local licensure

170
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,390
all the way to state licensing

171
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:31,120
compliance moving forward into

172
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:33,430
compliance auditing businesses so that

173
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,860
they're able to understand and grapple

174
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,509
with why the regulator's want to see

175
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,639
from them so it'll be an exciting

176
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:43,959
conversation I'm glad to have both

177
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,519
people from the jurisdictions here as

178
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,769
well as operators because that gives you

179
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:51,389
a dynamic flow of what everybody needs

180
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:51,389
to be dealing with today

181
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,439
so my name is Adam hey Jesse first of

182
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,630
all thanks Susan in the state of

183
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:01,209
cannabis for putting this awesome event

184
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:02,290
together so I'm on the board of

185
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:03,759
directors for the long beach collective

186
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,439
association long beach collective

187
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,329
association consists of all of the legal

188
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,370
legal operators in the city of Long

189
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:12,969
Beach which is retailers distributors

190
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:15,579
cultivators manufacturers we've been

191
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,100
around since 2010 so at the time we were

192
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:20,819
advocating for medical cannabis when the

193
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:24,400
city first bought its ordinance forward

194
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:26,500
we have been through a very tough time

195
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,289
to find regulation working from the

196
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,970
community up to find consensus with city

197
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,610
and different departments throughout the

198
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,139
city and community leaders see what's

199
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,129
the best way to bring regulation in the

200
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:41,620
city of Long Beach so currently we have

201
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:43,570
about 150 different applicants in the

202
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,610
city and and our membership is growing

203
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,150
and the issues that we face here in the

204
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,129
city also the owner and the managing

205
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:53,669
partner at Long Beach greenroom and the

206
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:58,029
station the first legal cannabis

207
00:08:53,669 --> 00:09:04,599
facility again in 2017 is going to be

208
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:07,569
opened so so as you can see we have a

209
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:11,440
great variety of stakeholders who are

210
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,010
here what I want to ask the stakeholders

211
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,890
here

212
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:18,700
today is to feel free to be completely

213
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:20,409
transparent I really besides from

214
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,590
moderating this panel want to use this

215
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:24,579
as an opportunity to really learn from

216
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,690
experiences and I do think that it's

217
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,940
great that we have folks that are

218
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,090
operating in different jurisdictions so

219
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:36,640
I guess I want to start off by asking

220
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:39,160
for Joe Jerrod what does retail

221
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,110
operation look like in the city of Los

222
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:43,089
Angeles what does access look like in

223
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:46,210
the city of Los Angeles or in the city

224
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:51,129
of Sacramento what does the retail space

225
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:53,800
look like just generally well thanks for

226
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:56,230
asking cat I think I think the thing is

227
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:57,339
now is there's been a lot of extinction

228
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,289
events that have been happening with

229
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,379
regulations and it's been pushing a lot

230
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:04,839
of everyone in the supply chain to kind

231
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:07,389
of the brink of their own pocketbooks or

232
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,519
venture capital and just kind of the

233
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:12,100
whiplash we have from regulations being

234
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,289
swung from a completely unregulated

235
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,670
industry to the most regulated product

236
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:17,559
ever in California history

237
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:20,709
and to have us do that in a small amount

238
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:22,659
of time has been has been difficult and

239
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:27,639
and you can see that there's kind of

240
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:31,299
been an emboldened prices has been so

241
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:33,159
vastly like expanded now that you know

242
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:36,000
you're looking at 50 to 60% difference

243
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:38,289
in costs and there is that kind of

244
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,090
benchmark where people are willing to

245
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:42,309
pay a little bit more for a regulated

246
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,170
tax product but I think we've gone way

247
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,669
beyond that at this point and we're

248
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:48,909
pushing people back to the black market

249
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:51,610
and it's not just pushing consumers it's

250
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:53,559
not enticing people who are in the black

251
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,690
market looking for a space in the

252
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:58,539
regulated market to allow them to say

253
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,580
there's a comfortable place to go if you

254
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:02,079
really take the risk and the money and

255
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,879
the effort to make sure you get to

256
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,700
regulated and so that gap has been

257
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:09,909
widening so much now that every single

258
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,650
tax we have at the state and local

259
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:14,319
levels I mean the city of Los Angeles

260
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:18,519
has a ten percent gross receipts tax on

261
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,710
on on recreational use well now 80

262
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,899
percent of my business is recreational

263
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,690
use that means there's a 10% tax on 80%

264
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:28,029
of my of my users there and it's mo

265
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:31,660
just because most people are letting

266
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:33,189
their recreation kind of just fall by

267
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:35,889
the wayside because there's not a lot of

268
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,230
incentives so I would ask everyone at

269
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:40,090
this at this level of cat and Joe to

270
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,920
really look at how are we going to

271
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,810
entice people back to the medical model

272
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,459
when is that conversation between a

273
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,169
patient and a doctor really going to

274
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,300
happen because this may be a

275
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:51,159
recreational use but there are a lot of

276
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:53,169
medicinal uses that you use kind of

277
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,819
recreationally we have two beers before

278
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:56,740
we go somewhere because we want to go

279
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,360
out well a joint is kind of the same way

280
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,039
that we look at it it's a way to relax

281
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,450
and it is something medicinal to take

282
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,969
away stress and if we don't have that

283
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:06,040
conversation with doctors and we pull

284
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,019
further and further away from the

285
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:09,519
medical model I think we really are

286
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,500
gonna get distant away from what our

287
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,850
real needs are which is we have a

288
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,620
product that can kind of balance between

289
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,200
medical and recreational pretty easily

290
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,519
but the balance is swung and so I think

291
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,560
we really need to kind of entice people

292
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,189
back into that medical model and I think

293
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,509
lowering taxes to to medical users and

294
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,640
trying to draw more of those

295
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:30,429
prescriptions back because I mean as a

296
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:34,000
business I'm seeing that that there's a

297
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:36,729
thousand other illegal dispensaries and

298
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,250
delivery companies in LA that have this

299
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:42,550
firm advantage over me as an independent

300
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,620
business and so until we lower taxes to

301
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:46,089
a you know an equitable way to kind of

302
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,950
compete with the black market I think

303
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,720
the pendulum has swung too far in the

304
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,180
direction of over taxation and we're

305
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,920
gonna have to look at this taxation kind

306
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:56,500
of rolling out over three to five years

307
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,120
because I don't know a lot of people who

308
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,129
have been in this industry this long who

309
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,539
are feeling like wow this is great I'm

310
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:04,750
this is the most successful I've ever

311
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:06,339
been now that that's like so I want to

312
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,870
feel that way and I want to tell people

313
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,399
in the black market that that's the way

314
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,070
that I feel is the most successful I've

315
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,569
ever been but it's not and I think and I

316
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,760
think we need to really look at each

317
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,220
other and go how do we lower these costs

318
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,110
of becoming compliant and how do we

319
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,480
lower the barriers to entry back into

320
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,220
this industry because we've got 50,000

321
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,259
growers and users and people who have

322
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,899
created a huge amount of infrastructure

323
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:30,338
already and we're not utilizing the

324
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:32,799
infrastructure that's already been built

325
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:35,080
in this economy of cannabis we have to

326
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,659
use it to its full capacity otherwise

327
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,160
we're destroying lives families and

328
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:41,740
infrastructure that could easily make

329
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:44,439
tax dollars for us so I think that's

330
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,240
where I am as a retailer and as I look

331
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,920
at my group of retailers and we're not

332
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,659
going well look at all the greatness

333
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,208
that we have here we're mostly looking

334
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:53,860
like who's illegal and I hate to feel

335
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,149
that way because if you've been in this

336
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,579
industry long enough you know that

337
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:59,169
you've teetered on that edge of legal

338
00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:00,549
and illegal the whole time that's what

339
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:03,759
the that's what the system is kind of

340
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:06,039
set up so we're not drawing people over

341
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,199
that over that fence to say come into

342
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,730
the regulated light let all that let all

343
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:11,859
the tax dollars go back to the

344
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,778
municipalities who put a lot of time and

345
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,519
effort I mean we've been working with la

346
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:17,409
for a decade now trying to make sure

347
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,750
that we got a license and we worked

348
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:22,028
through limited immunity forever and so

349
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,129
to have a license now in LA and to not

350
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,958
be on a fair and level playing field

351
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,659
with other businesses is a really

352
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:35,438
difficult place for a lot of retailers

353
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:36,789
thank you but before you respond Joe I

354
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:39,009
just want to make a note you're gonna

355
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:41,889
hear me say something that I said

356
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:45,818
yesterday while we were in Denver I I

357
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:47,649
want to make a point in Jared I hear

358
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:49,568
what you're saying we want to make sure

359
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:52,269
that folks don't have to compete with

360
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:57,039
the illicit market just a note about

361
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:59,078
terminology here just as we've continued

362
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:02,528
to move forward and change our

363
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:06,399
terminology to say cannabis instead of

364
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:09,250
marijuana it's I feel as though it is

365
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,870
important for me to articulate that we

366
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,549
are at a moment in this industry where

367
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,100
it's no longer appropriate to use the

368
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:17,469
term black-market to mean criminal

369
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,990
market so that'll be my ask to the

370
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,300
panelists as we move forward when we

371
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,430
mean when we say black market we mean

372
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:27,068
criminal market we mean illicit market

373
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:30,370
we mean unregulated market we should use

374
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:32,349
those terms instead of using black to

375
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:35,009
mean criminal so make that ask of my

376
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:38,230
panelists I'll make this ask of the room

377
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:40,120
and and we'll catch ourselves using it

378
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,558
we'll have to work through this we'll

379
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,028
find other words that are no longer

380
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:47,078
appropriate we'll work through that

381
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:51,450
process I should have said it first but

382
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:55,739
uh thank you Jeff you're right

383
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:58,050
taxation is a huge issue and in fact I

384
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,230
got maybe into a little bit of trouble

385
00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:04,199
saying as much to someone that maybe

386
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:08,250
didn't want to hear it that works for a

387
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,480
different regulatory agency but tax we

388
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,590
do need to have a robust conversation

389
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,230
around taxation and I think for me one

390
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,550
of the things right now I'm trying to

391
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,279
what I'd like to understand actually

392
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:22,199
just had a conversation with a market

393
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,970
research companies is how can we

394
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,190
understand who that consumer is and

395
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:28,590
where is that tipping point what is the

396
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,540
price elasticity of cannabis but before

397
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,250
they go you know I you know to the heck

398
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:34,529
with it I'm just gonna go call my my

399
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,480
buddy who I've been buying cannabis for

400
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:39,870
for the last twenty years and I still

401
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,029
can so we need to understand really that

402
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,519
consumer and kind of what is the tipping

403
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:46,620
point and maybe have getting some data

404
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,809
around that I think could help foster

405
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,570
that conversation in a and drive the

406
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:53,789
conversation in a meaningful way the

407
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:56,629
retail kind of situation in Sacramento

408
00:16:53,789 --> 00:17:00,389
is we've had thirty dispensaries since

409
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:05,119
2012 we essentially have had a

410
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:07,680
moratorium on that since since that time

411
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,909
we kind of backed into our dispensaries

412
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,670
they started popping up all over town

413
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,440
and council said don't move and then

414
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,940
through federal actions and some

415
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:19,289
attrition we ended up with 30 and it's

416
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:23,250
state at 30 I think are the more dynamic

417
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:25,529
part of our retail is around delivery at

418
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:29,579
the moment and one of the challenges

419
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:31,440
that we're facing with delivery is that

420
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:33,389
while we've had delivery and it's

421
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,420
existed in in our community for a number

422
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:40,650
of years it hasn't existed in a form

423
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:43,590
that looked like a business right there

424
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:46,560
wasn't a brick-and-mortar and so when

425
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:52,409
when we created a registry to try and

426
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:55,379
bring these existing operators into the

427
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,210
legal framework they registered with

428
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,710
addresses that they weren't operating

429
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:02,700
out of that maybe they couldn't have

430
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,250
that they'll ever be able to really

431
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:08,150
functionally operate out of and so

432
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:12,019
that is presented a challenge and we are

433
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:15,620
muddling through it we have 65 70

434
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:18,829
applications for non storefront delivery

435
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:20,119
in Sacramento and we're going to

436
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:22,639
continue to kind of muddle through it

437
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:26,479
until we you know figure it out and my

438
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:30,530
hope is that enough folks survive that

439
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,799
transition and and don't you know become

440
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:36,619
extinct

441
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:39,649
same question to Adam what's happening

442
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:41,989
in Long Beach in 2010 the city of Long

443
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,090
Beach brought forward an ordinance 5.8 7

444
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,519
which originally legalized for the first

445
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:50,209
time retailers and cultivation one of

446
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:53,180
the first cities to do so recently then

447
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:56,779
there was a gap from 2012 to 2017 about

448
00:18:53,180 --> 00:19:00,170
five years of no cannabis whatsoever now

449
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:02,480
coming back this time around we just

450
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,220
literally got recreational cannabis in

451
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,009
the city of Long Beach probably around

452
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,289
three four weeks ago yeah so that was uh

453
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:10,279
that you know we were hoping to start at

454
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,440
the beginning of the year but it ended

455
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:14,420
up being in July so that was a huge

456
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,250
issue to not be able to let people back

457
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,700
you know we were denying people entrance

458
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,509
into the facilities right now a lot of

459
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,370
people are just going through the

460
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:25,910
process I think there's only about five

461
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:27,349
or there's about ten or eleven retail

462
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,060
facilities that are actually open in the

463
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:30,409
city of Long Beach currently they're

464
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,210
working through the process the fire

465
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,570
department the building department at

466
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,640
electrical mechanical plumbing so it's

467
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:40,549
been moving along the city of Long Beach

468
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,410
has been pretty friendly and as

469
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:43,940
proactive with helping businesses as

470
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,220
much as possible considering the fact

471
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:50,180
that they're dealing this kind of for

472
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:51,710
the first time on this level so that's

473
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:55,400
that's been awesome so now if facilities

474
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:57,769
are here now in regards to patients or

475
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,810
the consumers kind of echoing a little

476
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:01,549
bit of you know Jared was saying you

477
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:04,669
know taxation is an issue the illicit

478
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:06,019
markets has always been around but we

479
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,200
need to be able to give a viable option

480
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:11,029
to patients and consumers to be able to

481
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,789
walk through these facilities and you

482
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:14,710
know the taxation and where the taxation

483
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:17,349
kind of start

484
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,990
and a lot of the policy that you saw is

485
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:21,929
emotional driven policies these are

486
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,920
policies from regulators legislators

487
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,880
when they looked at Canada mister if

488
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,100
they could all let's suppose to put a

489
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,510
syntax it's really a tax it's a high tax

490
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:30,669
if we're gonna have it in our in our

491
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:32,710
city let's let's tax it at this late

492
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:34,210
let's at least and thinking that

493
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,490
everybody was gonna come and these has

494
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,259
these high tax dollars but I think there

495
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,910
was a governor's report that came

496
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:42,309
understated in regards to the amount of

497
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,870
tax because there wasn't a true

498
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:47,349
understanding of the economics and

499
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:49,479
mechanics behind the cannabis consumers

500
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:51,279
and the taxation and I definitely

501
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,599
welcome that conversation and there

502
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:56,879
should something should be something

503
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:56,879
that that happens in regard stats

504
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:02,259
in regards to illicit markets they're

505
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,779
gonna be here they're here right now I

506
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:06,460
think you know again Jared was

507
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:08,529
mentioning is giving the opportunity for

508
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,210
people to get involved and a lot of the

509
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:12,220
times when the city sets cities set up

510
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,350
these they're so limited and they're so

511
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,500
tough to be able to get some of these

512
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:19,000
licenses so being able to streamline

513
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,950
some of it I mean you have facility you

514
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,619
have cities that they do see you Pease

515
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,210
business licenses developing agreements

516
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:27,909
three four different kinds of licenses

517
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,309
to be able to get one license you know

518
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,930
and then when you're done with that you

519
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:33,190
have to deal with the BCC that food of

520
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,410
that you have to deal with all these

521
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,370
different departments so it's kind of

522
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,440
tasted like a little bit like nuclear

523
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:40,439
waste right now everybody's very you

524
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,570
know eyeballing and regulating it

525
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,009
heavily so I think it's gonna normalize

526
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,329
and it's really about the perception and

527
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:48,609
that's really the most important thing

528
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:50,799
is the people are scared who's gonna get

529
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:52,929
in who's gonna be touching this where

530
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,319
the majority of people are everyday

531
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:58,450
people or big businesses that are

532
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:01,119
getting involved so it's a little bit of

533
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:04,870
what's going on and Pamela I want to ask

534
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:07,929
you a question Adam was just discussing

535
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:11,169
the challenge and bureaucracy of going

536
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:13,240
through the licensing process with your

537
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,400
consulting firm in your law firm how

538
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,220
have you been able to help folks

539
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:23,530
navigate what seemed like very turbulent

540
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:26,559
waters yeah part of it comes to your

541
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:27,910
business and interfacing with the city

542
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,329
and helping to edge

543
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,019
and being a source of constant

544
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:36,220
information we're just going to talk

545
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:38,109
about with regard to taxes is for a

546
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,120
greater part these cities are going

547
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:41,979
through drafting tax ordinance and

548
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:44,319
ballot measures and what that language

549
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,539
looks like and it's important to be

550
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:49,389
engaged in that discussion especially if

551
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:52,089
you're an operator ah to be able to say

552
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,860
this tax is going to drive me out of

553
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:56,709
business this tax isn't going to have

554
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:59,139
the ROI to your city that you think it's

555
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,720
going to because if I can't operate

556
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,370
there's no influx of capital and then

557
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,710
being able to work with them on the

558
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:07,989
language as we're starting to see moving

559
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:11,410
throughout the state is the flexibility

560
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:14,289
for by resolution the cities to be able

561
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:16,210
to change the tax levels because to have

562
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:17,619
to go back to the voters is very

563
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,509
difficult so if you have these

564
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:21,579
conversations as you're moving forward

565
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:23,379
in the process you're able to do that I

566
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:25,720
think the other thing for applicants to

567
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,430
do or operators to do and we talked

568
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,920
about this a lot with our clients is

569
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,480
your application is your promise to the

570
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,820
city so if you're working with a

571
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,160
consultant or an attorney know what

572
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:38,230
they're putting in your documents make

573
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,330
sure you're sitting and reading for

574
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,240
example your community benefits plan if

575
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:46,119
you're going to make a promise to a city

576
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,539
that you're going to give them let's say

577
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:50,529
20 percent of your gross sales receipts

578
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:52,839
because you're in a competitive

579
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:54,879
application and you're like this is what

580
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,829
they want to hear and this is gonna make

581
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,810
me look successful especially if it's a

582
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:59,529
development agreement and then you come

583
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:02,589
up short

584
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:04,269
these are one-year permits everybody

585
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:07,329
should remember this is not a vested

586
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:09,579
right you have to go back work with your

587
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:12,279
city tell them what you've been able to

588
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:14,379
accomplish and do and if they don't

589
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:18,519
trust you or believe you because you're

590
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:20,140
making unrealistic promises to them then

591
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:22,289
you won't have a business and somebody

592
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,670
else you're gonna be an acquisition

593
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:27,430
target or you're gonna be extinct

594
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:29,800
because the way that I look at it and we

595
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:32,170
look at it is that you've got three real

596
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:34,419
options coming into 2019

597
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,970
you're an acquisition target you're

598
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,310
gonna survive an acquisition event or

599
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:42,069
unfortunately you're going to be extinct

600
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:44,559
and the best way that you cannot go into

601
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:48,519
door number three and survive one in two

602
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:51,009
is to have a good plan and to be able to

603
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:54,099
navigate that process and to be able to

604
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:56,589
have an open conversation with the those

605
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:59,799
that you are engaged in business with

606
00:24:56,589 --> 00:25:02,019
you operate in a city every day and

607
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:03,789
you're going to come across issues that

608
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:05,470
you're gonna have to go to planning and

609
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:07,180
building and you're gonna have to go to

610
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,059
the business license division I talked

611
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,660
to Emily at the city of Long Beach on

612
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:15,579
behalf of my clients that are there on a

613
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:18,490
constant basis and it's an evolution we

614
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:21,399
need to bring in capital so we have to

615
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,720
add an owner how do you go about doing

616
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,550
that when a lot of times we've seen

617
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,500
throughout these jurisdictions our

618
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:29,289
prohibition on transfer and that means

619
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,559
that you can't change ownership how do

620
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:34,659
you grow and scale as a business if you

621
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,029
are improving a building and you can't

622
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:39,100
bring in capital the same way other

623
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:42,670
businesses would we've been able to

624
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:44,349
change the ordinances by having

625
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,600
conversations with people like Joe and

626
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:49,179
Kath and explaining those very

627
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:51,429
real-world business problems and being

628
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,440
able to manipulate that language when

629
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:56,049
you look at sensitive use receptors as

630
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,900
I'm sure all of the operators are

631
00:25:56,049 --> 00:26:00,700
familiar that process is difficult we

632
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,860
are just going through that in Culver

633
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,380
City for a client it's a really

634
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:07,569
interesting use you go in you apply and

635
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,740
is that I'm sure Jerrod and Adam can

636
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:10,809
tell you you look for a piece of

637
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,120
property you're looking for a unicorn

638
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:15,579
that it's in the Green Zone it's zoned

639
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,609
correctly it has enough power it has

640
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:21,460
parking it meets all the requirements

641
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:23,079
you go you apply you get a business

642
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,660
license and then you have to go through

643
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:27,609
a Cu P what if a sensitive use to

644
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,310
receptor either accidentally or on

645
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:31,779
purpose

646
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:34,240
unfortunately opens up next to you if

647
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:35,680
you don't set the game board if you

648
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,079
don't work with the city and say at the

649
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,539
time of the submission window set the

650
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:44,169
game board set where the green zones are

651
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:46,389
if a use comes in they understand that

652
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:48,429
the potential for a cannabis business is

653
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,830
there because if you do it at the date

654
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:52,450
of receipt of application and you have a

655
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:55,089
30-60-90

656
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,740
application window all the sudden these

657
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:59,439
operators have invested tens of

658
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:02,079
thousands of dollars and they're

659
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,700
buffered out overnight or if at that

660
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,099
time of issuance and you're going

661
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,840
through a CEP and we saw this in Lemon

662
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:10,869
Grove somebody popped in to daycare

663
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:13,929
center paid them $10,000 to have file

664
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:15,219
the paperwork so that somebody else no

665
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:17,259
longer could move forward in that

666
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,600
process if the regulator's don't

667
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:21,129
understand if the cities don't

668
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,199
understand that this is what you're

669
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:26,050
grappling with they don't know how to

670
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,509
respond to that so I think overall the

671
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:30,789
most important is to be informed be

672
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:32,799
engaged work with a good lawyer work

673
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:35,319
with a good consultant but know what

674
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:38,139
they're doing and direct them don't let

675
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:40,269
somebody say I think Amanda said it best

676
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,920
yesterday put a windmill on top of your

677
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:44,829
building because it's gonna make you

678
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,960
more attractive or solar and then not be

679
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,639
able to do it and it's not feasible

680
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,039
that's only shooting yourself in the

681
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,750
foot and and showering a relationship

682
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:57,000
with a city that's moving into

683
00:27:52,750 --> 00:28:00,160
regulation that is difficult Eric we

684
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,140
heard jared mentioned these mastic mass

685
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:08,920
extinction moments either on January 1st

686
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,750
or July 1st what has that meant for a

687
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,009
distributor what does that meant for

688
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:15,430
distributors across the state of

689
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:18,730
California so we look at this market as

690
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:20,680
a consumer market so if you would look

691
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,860
at the cannabis industry as a consumer

692
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:28,480
market the way we do we see for market

693
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:31,299
segments flower concentrates edibles and

694
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,490
wellness we what we use wellness as a

695
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:35,109
catch-all category for the topicals and

696
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,150
the tinctures and the stuff that doesn't

697
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:39,039
fit into the other categories so we know

698
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,780
how much of the current volume is going

699
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,789
through each of the categories what's

700
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:47,609
been fascinating about these extinction

701
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:52,329
moments is July 1st caused a complete

702
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:54,369
reset of the flower category a complete

703
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:57,220
reset what do I mean by that I mean that

704
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:59,919
the stores were empty to the point where

705
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:03,000
if you had a previous brand in the old

706
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:05,298
regime you still had to start over just

707
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,368
like everybody who is start

708
00:29:05,298 --> 00:29:09,440
/ with a new brand in the new regime

709
00:29:07,368 --> 00:29:11,449
everybody had to learn how to package

710
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,700
everybody had to learn how to test

711
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,169
everybody had to learn how to make sure

712
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,210
that everything was child proofed

713
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:21,559
everybody had to learn how to go into

714
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:23,808
the store with the right COAS the right

715
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:26,509
proof that this product is correct and

716
00:29:23,808 --> 00:29:28,339
we learned that over the six-month

717
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:30,048
period some of the brand's learned that

718
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:32,359
some of the brand's didn't learn that

719
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:35,298
and needed to start learning it in the

720
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:38,358
new July 1 Post July 1 environment so

721
00:29:35,298 --> 00:29:41,858
that's what we're seeing and it's really

722
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:45,319
fascinating because inside of this new

723
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:47,058
emergent time in the flower space you're

724
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:50,569
gonna start to see some real innovation

725
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:53,898
and I see that innovation coming over

726
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:56,329
the next 90 250 days you're gonna see

727
00:29:53,898 --> 00:29:58,189
brands that you've never seen before

728
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:59,928
that are gonna blow your socks off from

729
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:02,028
a branding perspective they're gonna

730
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:05,149
start to look like brands that you

731
00:30:02,028 --> 00:30:08,028
recognize from the alcohol world from

732
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:10,128
the consumer packaged world the boxes

733
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:12,169
are gonna be pretty there's gonna be a

734
00:30:10,128 --> 00:30:14,748
backstory for the brands so you're gonna

735
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:17,720
know where they came from and who's

736
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:19,778
behind them and what they're sourcing is

737
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:24,350
and why they believe what they believe

738
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:27,079
about you and you joining as a consumer

739
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:29,628
their tribe so that's coming and it's

740
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:35,178
really exciting so I want to ask you

741
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:38,628
another question Pamela what has it look

742
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:40,970
like for businesses to work with one

743
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:43,069
another to set up these agreements to

744
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:46,159
set up contracts to ensure that there

745
00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:48,408
are products on the shelves and I'm sure

746
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,109
there was disruption when we went

747
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:54,460
through these various moments January 1

748
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:57,710
2018 I know in the city of Los Angeles

749
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,509
there was a lot of disruption so I want

750
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,399
to hear from Pamela first and then Jared

751
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:04,278
I'd like to hear from you as well we've

752
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:06,858
seen with our operators that legacy

753
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:08,720
operators and early adopters tend to

754
00:31:06,858 --> 00:31:10,788
have the most difficulty here because

755
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,950
they're used to saying this is somebody

756
00:31:10,788 --> 00:31:14,599
I trust they're used to saying you know

757
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,769
I didn't put things in writing because

758
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:20,299
that was evidence and that was Evan

759
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:23,819
that I was teetering in this you know

760
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:27,389
almost regulated limited immunity

761
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:29,609
whatever it is that these times had and

762
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,980
so it's really coming around to this

763
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:34,319
sensibility of what is traditional

764
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:37,500
regular business we have this

765
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:39,990
conversation a lot what do other heavily

766
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,509
regulated industries do we're not

767
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:44,910
reinventing the wheel in cannabis we are

768
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:48,750
simply adding another widget to a

769
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:51,930
commodities market and so contracting is

770
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:54,210
the cornerstone and the fundamentals of

771
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:56,190
good business because there are

772
00:31:54,210 --> 00:32:00,390
provisions and there are things that are

773
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:02,400
coming as we march towards ever close

774
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,620
our full legalization at the federal

775
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,420
level what does that mean that means you

776
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:08,159
can get to federal court when we're

777
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,050
talking about negligence claims and

778
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,420
we're talking about products liabilities

779
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:14,849
claims that are coming there are things

780
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:18,110
like treble damages that happen when you

781
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:20,579
can get into a federal situation so

782
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:24,000
they're looming they're waiting we've

783
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:26,549
seen prop 65 lawsuits that are coming

784
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,579
you've got to be ahead of it you've got

785
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:31,470
to know that when you're a retailer if

786
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:33,329
you're contracting or you're a

787
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:36,059
manufacturer and you're contracting to

788
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:38,339
get flour how that flour is getting to

789
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:40,980
you where's the custody and control who

790
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:44,519
is in control of it who is responsible

791
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:46,680
if there is a rate an accident

792
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,900
hijacking who is responsible for this

793
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:52,380
product are you covered from an

794
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:54,380
insurance perspective who where does it

795
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:58,230
go if you're using a transport only

796
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:00,660
licensee they can't hold custody to the

797
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:03,390
product so on one end of that

798
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:05,580
transaction somebody's covering when

799
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:07,590
somebody else is moving physically

800
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:10,109
moving the product when you're talking

801
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:12,569
about our QA QC procedures here in

802
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:14,309
California protect the consumer that's

803
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:17,460
what they're driven to do so the point

804
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:18,960
of testing is right before it gets b2c

805
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,789
that's when the distributor's

806
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,529
responsibility that means if you're a

807
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:25,710
man if you're a cultivator and you're

808
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:28,220
selling product to a manufacturer where

809
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:30,319
that product may get contaminated

810
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,509
if it's that it's clean when it lasts

811
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,980
the cultivators but by the time it gets

812
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:35,720
the manufacturer and the manufacturer

813
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,890
doesn't test it before they manufacture

814
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,019
it and all of a sudden it gets

815
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,009
concentrated and at the end of the line

816
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:42,408
at tests dirty

817
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:44,509
whose responsibility is that that's a

818
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:47,720
contract term that's where you need to

819
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:51,349
be panning out all of these different

820
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:54,919
levels of how you interface together as

821
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:57,740
a supply chain making sure that the

822
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:00,020
excise tax is collected and paid you are

823
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:02,029
responsible from the state agency's

824
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:05,058
perspective for everything that you do

825
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:06,889
and everything that it goes along the

826
00:34:05,058 --> 00:34:08,929
pivot points on the supply chain so

827
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:12,648
you're gonna want to know that everybody

828
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:14,269
else in that line is doing the same

829
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:16,789
thing you are and the best way to

830
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:19,219
protect yourself and your business is

831
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:22,519
through these agreements and it's a

832
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:25,219
difficult lift it is not easy it is

833
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:27,829
expensive you're going to start to see

834
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:30,888
the prices coming down working with a

835
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:33,409
good lawyer you get a what I'd like to

836
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:35,960
say is a suite of agreements that then

837
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:38,358
you're just tearing off of so if you're

838
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,608
a vendor ask a distributor to send you a

839
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:42,199
distribution agreement don't read it

840
00:34:40,608 --> 00:34:44,809
read it yourself

841
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:47,059
have your lawyer read it go through what

842
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:48,918
red lines you want to do and then have a

843
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:51,168
meaningful conversation we're all

844
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:54,319
figuring it out that's the great part

845
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:57,199
about this industry is it is community

846
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,880
based we've most of us have been here

847
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,980
we're working through these issues

848
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,190
together use it as a collaborative

849
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:06,740
framework but please don't cut the fat

850
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:09,619
when it comes to your legal

851
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:12,739
representation and putting down on paper

852
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:15,470
where responsibilities liabilities and

853
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:18,949
warranties go when we're talking about

854
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:21,230
packaging and labeling and where that

855
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:24,559
little California universal symbol needs

856
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:26,150
to go and the primary panel this is my

857
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:28,099
plea there are four things

858
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:30,680
I know branding we just talked about

859
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:32,720
being very expensive your logo is not

860
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:36,618
one of the four things that needs to be

861
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:38,449
on the front of your product hi I'm

862
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:41,358
sorry I understand I have this

863
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:42,199
conversation several times the day it

864
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:44,929
isn't

865
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:47,659
it's the net weight in US and foreign

866
00:35:44,929 --> 00:35:50,960
metrics it is the universal California

867
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:53,179
symbol which should be in scale size to

868
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,119
your logo it should not be the tiniest

869
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:57,980
thing with your big logo and then you've

870
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,318
got to name your product a vape

871
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:03,469
cartridge is not correct

872
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:06,500
it's a cannabis vape cartridge needs to

873
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:09,019
identify the product name and it needs

874
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,358
to be on the part of your product with

875
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:13,460
the ordinary course of business that a

876
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:15,409
consumer sees I'm sure that Jerrod and

877
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,420
Adam go through this all the time when

878
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:19,848
you're checking these products do you

879
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:22,730
take them into your store do you run the

880
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:25,190
risk of the BCC coming in and somebody

881
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:27,170
saying hey they're getting easier and

882
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,970
easier to identify I don't know if

883
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:30,980
jarred and out and went away in but

884
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:34,219
these days I walk into a dispensary you

885
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:37,099
can zero in on a non-compliant package

886
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:39,618
much more quickly so this isn't the time

887
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:42,500
to play around it's the time to contract

888
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:44,530
put all the terms in writing make sure

889
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,969
you understand what they are evidence

890
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:50,720
that you're meeting all of these other

891
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:53,179
ancillary regulatory protocols and then

892
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:56,779
you can go about the business of being

893
00:36:53,179 --> 00:37:00,739
profitable and being ready to survive

894
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:02,960
into 2019 that was a lot of great advice

895
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:05,779
that was shared Jerrod I want to ask you

896
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,548
I communicate with Los Angeles

897
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,200
stakeholders on a regular basis and one

898
00:37:07,548 --> 00:37:11,829
of the frustrations that I heard very

899
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:14,779
early on when we started our process

900
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:16,730
from our existing medical marijuana

901
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:20,180
dispensaries was that they were

902
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:22,068
concerned because of our phase Licensing

903
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:25,429
approach that they weren't going to be

904
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:27,679
able to carry los angeles-based products

905
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:29,659
on the shelves and so I know a lot of

906
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,298
those relationships have changed over

907
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:35,118
time because folks don't have licensing

908
00:37:32,298 --> 00:37:37,940
yet what has that meant for your retail

909
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,039
business and your existing relationships

910
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,480
with other either cultivators or

911
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:44,690
manufacturers in the city of Los Angeles

912
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,699
how has that changed over time I think

913
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:49,068
we took a couple of steps back as being

914
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:52,219
the leader in the world with production

915
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:54,170
in Los Angeles by not allowing the

916
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:54,719
producers to really continue the

917
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,220
relation

918
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,379
chips of which they had had for well

919
00:37:56,219 --> 00:38:00,719
over a decade and supplying all the

920
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,550
consumers of Los Angeles a lot of the

921
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,009
products that they wanted and by cutting

922
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:07,590
off that supply chain you had to now

923
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:11,070
jump outside of Los Angeles to find

924
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:13,559
relationships and I mean I'm uniquely I

925
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:15,359
guess benefit from coming from Northern

926
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:16,739
California and having a lot of those

927
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,779
relationships with direct with

928
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:20,309
cultivators I know that where I live

929
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,619
it's one degree of separation from a

930
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:24,900
cultivator in Southern California it's

931
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:26,579
six degrees of separation and so to find

932
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,559
that direct connection with someone you

933
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,730
can trust or someone who has a product

934
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:32,309
that you can tell what the consistency

935
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:33,960
is or know that there's gonna be you

936
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:35,608
know a consistent amount of product so

937
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,380
that your customers can become very

938
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:39,690
aware of what products you have and

939
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,820
expect them to be tomorrow that got cut

940
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:44,429
off and a lot of the people who had

941
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,530
spent branding opportunities in LA to

942
00:38:44,429 --> 00:38:48,569
target that market when they didn't have

943
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,760
the ability to grow or produce or

944
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:52,710
manufacture and distribute inside the

945
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,230
city I think it I think it took us back

946
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:57,750
a little bit but in the grand scheme of

947
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:00,300
things you're looking at more retail

948
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,588
licenses than any other municipality so

949
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,690
we had to start somewhere

950
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:04,920
it wasn't just this free-for-all there's

951
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:07,559
already been a free-for-all in Los

952
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,630
Angeles for a long time and so when you

953
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,130
have to draw the line somewhere and say

954
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:13,380
this is our starting point and this is

955
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:15,838
our foundation a lot of people got cut

956
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,309
out and I don't know how to say what we

957
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,980
could have done different to make sure

958
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:23,460
that more legacy operators were able to

959
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,829
enter into into the industry but it had

960
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:28,139
been illegal to grow off-site of a non

961
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:30,900
property compliant location for five

962
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:33,598
years so it's been known that that has

963
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,550
been an illegal place to be but in this

964
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,920
industry of allowing the legacy people

965
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:40,019
of first opportunity to enter into the

966
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,909
regulated market I think we waited a

967
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:44,130
little too long in Los Angeles to really

968
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:47,159
allow those legacy people an opportunity

969
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:50,130
supply their own community and I think

970
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,690
we will build really fast in Los Angeles

971
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:53,400
and there's gonna be some unfortunate

972
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,980
legacy people who are not going to make

973
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,420
it we are not a normal business I mean

974
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,579
when I look across the street at one of

975
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,200
the largest Ralph's in the country and I

976
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:03,329
know that I pay almost the same kind of

977
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,309
business taxes they do with my five

978
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:06,989
million dollars of revenue and their two

979
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:09,000
hundred million dollars of revenue

980
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:12,029
we have the same business taxes we are

981
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,469
not equal businesses so so we have to

982
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,330
look at ourselves and go yes we want to

983
00:40:13,469 --> 00:40:16,829
operate like normal businesses but we're

984
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,779
not treated like a normal business

985
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:21,360
there's no other group that is even

986
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,640
above a point zero to seven percent like

987
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,769
retail taxes of business tax inside the

988
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,839
city of Los Angeles so to say that I'm

989
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:29,519
paying close to eight percent on average

990
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,980
between my five and ten percent gross

991
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,409
receipts tax for a local tax like we're

992
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,780
not a normal business and being taxed at

993
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:38,250
fifty and sixty percent and then then at

994
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,560
the end of the year having my accountant

995
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,820
say wow you're 280 taxes well you're

996
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,619
gonna have another four hundred thousand

997
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,260
you're like whoa I did not necessarily

998
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:49,230
budget for that and so how do you budget

999
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:51,240
for an unknown of all these taxes and

1000
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:53,550
since we have swung the pendulum so far

1001
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:55,919
and are not giving any relief to

1002
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:58,350
businesses just trying to be good

1003
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,599
operators it's just been a very

1004
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:02,309
difficult time and I think Los Angeles

1005
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:03,868
has a good opportunity to really show

1006
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:06,719
the strength that we have as a community

1007
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:08,160
and rebuild together but we're still

1008
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:09,719
waiting for fire to come and do

1009
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:11,639
inspections so we don't know what the

1010
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:12,689
attrition rate of the fire department is

1011
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,980
going to be where the building

1012
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,780
Department of Planning is going to be

1013
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,579
and since a lot of these variables are

1014
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,980
still up in the air there's a lot of

1015
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:22,049
there's a lot of insecurity because

1016
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,000
we've invested like my whole life

1017
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,550
savings is currently in my business I

1018
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,230
don't have a savings anymore and because

1019
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,869
it's all right here and what used to be

1020
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:33,059
a nice return on investment now it's

1021
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:34,950
it's a maybe and that maybe is becoming

1022
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:36,960
more and more difficult to say who is

1023
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:38,909
willing to take their life savings put

1024
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,320
it into this industry again and start

1025
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:41,670
from scratch because that's kind of what

1026
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,340
we're doing we're starting from the

1027
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:46,650
beginning or we're well we're well

1028
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,539
regulated we're well taxed I just want

1029
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:51,450
to make sure that those taxes and and

1030
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:53,639
representation really go to how are you

1031
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:56,219
effectively helping our businesses make

1032
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:59,039
it in this particular new regulated

1033
00:41:56,219 --> 00:42:00,899
industry how is the state of California

1034
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,210
doing enforcement and really helping us

1035
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,070
how are they lowering state taxes so

1036
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,079
that we don't have to have a huge burden

1037
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:09,059
with 280e on the federal can the state

1038
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:12,358
help us out can there be some places

1039
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:14,489
where we we do give to get I mean this

1040
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:15,840
the state didn't collect a lot of taxes

1041
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:17,159
and I don't think it was because they

1042
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,470
didn't think there was a lot of sales

1043
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,129
the velocity of sales were not there

1044
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:21,989
because

1045
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:23,700
wasn't enough retailers there wasn't

1046
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:25,349
enough compliant product because they

1047
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:27,269
created a system that bottleneck

1048
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:29,579
and that bottleneck lowered the number

1049
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:31,679
of regulated sales those number of

1050
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:33,000
regulated sales reduced our taxes and

1051
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,259
out looks like well the industry's not

1052
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,329
moving as fast as it could

1053
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,280
we're not utilizing all the

1054
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:40,409
infrastructure that has been created

1055
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,990
over the last 25 years plus in

1056
00:42:40,409 --> 00:42:45,629
California - the biggest benefit for the

1057
00:42:42,989 --> 00:42:47,669
most taxes in return we've gone too far

1058
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,950
to regulate and we're missing out on a

1059
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:52,170
lot of those legacy people who who need

1060
00:42:49,949 --> 00:42:54,000
more than just six months to a year to

1061
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:56,280
transition I look at some of the power

1062
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,230
plant companies and they're given 25

1063
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:02,580
years to adapt their coal burning power

1064
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:05,340
plant to a natural gas 125 years I'm

1065
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:07,500
given a year 18 months 6 months to adapt

1066
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,300
and sometimes it's two weeks to adapt to

1067
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,550
a brand new regulation that just got

1068
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,110
dropped yesterday that is not the kind

1069
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,850
of transitional time this kind of

1070
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:20,640
infrastructure needs to really be

1071
00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:22,440
efficient so we're here with you know

1072
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,900
many of the folks in this room are

1073
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,900
either cannabis advocates cannabis

1074
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,849
policy advocates cannabis businesses and

1075
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:32,309
this conversation involves many

1076
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:34,980
different stakeholders to include all of

1077
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:38,909
those folks community members law

1078
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:40,710
enforcement health officials and you

1079
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:42,149
know I think it's going to take and

1080
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:44,970
we've seen that it's going to take a

1081
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:49,980
collaborative effort for us to move this

1082
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:52,919
process forward as a regulator we deal

1083
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:56,070
with the other side of the coin of all

1084
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:59,250
of those same challenges and so I want

1085
00:43:56,070 --> 00:44:01,430
to hear from Joe what have been some of

1086
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:05,219
the biggest challenges in trying to

1087
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:07,710
either manage the retail and

1088
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:10,169
distribution space what have been the

1089
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:12,500
concerns that you hear from community

1090
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:15,450
members or elected officials about

1091
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:18,150
retail operations because as a regulator

1092
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:20,159
we kind of sit in the middle of all of

1093
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:22,710
these different stakeholders and

1094
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,049
translate and share information and try

1095
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:26,699
and move the needle forward so what has

1096
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:29,670
that process been for you what have been

1097
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:31,699
some of your biggest challenges all of

1098
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:36,548
them

1099
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:41,808
I find myself kind of in the uniquely I

1100
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:44,719
think in the middle of the public the

1101
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:46,730
elected officials and the NDA in the

1102
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:50,779
industry and and I think I understand

1103
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:53,119
that the the 360 view on all of this I I

1104
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:54,798
do think taxation is too high I mean

1105
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,420
fundamentally what we're trying to do is

1106
00:44:54,798 --> 00:45:02,389
apply economics to the regulation of

1107
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:04,670
this substance and you know economic

1108
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:07,279
principles still apply no matter how

1109
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:10,940
much you want to ignore them and so we

1110
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:16,849
do need to be sensitive to that I think

1111
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:19,130
that really is really the collective the

1112
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:21,619
totality of it right for the elective

1113
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:24,309
from from the electives perspective I

1114
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:27,349
think they look at this and like okay

1115
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:28,730
public voted for this but I know that

1116
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,260
they're not really a hundred percent

1117
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,849
supportive of it because when I go out

1118
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,369
and have a community meeting everyone's

1119
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:36,798
upset that there's a dispensary being

1120
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:39,079
planned near my house or someone wants

1121
00:45:36,798 --> 00:45:41,059
to open up a cultivation facility you

1122
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:42,019
know three miles from my house and

1123
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:44,798
pretty sure it's gonna ruin my

1124
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:50,028
neighborhood and ruin my property values

1125
00:45:44,798 --> 00:45:51,500
and for the the internal organizations

1126
00:45:50,028 --> 00:45:56,599
of the city we also face our own

1127
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:58,818
challenges we as a city began taking

1128
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:02,000
applications for cultivation in the

1129
00:45:58,818 --> 00:46:03,949
month of April a a year ago we didn't

1130
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,298
have you're required to get a

1131
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:07,009
conditional use permit in the same

1132
00:46:05,298 --> 00:46:10,278
Sacramento we didn't have a single

1133
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:12,200
hearing I think until July and wasn't

1134
00:46:10,278 --> 00:46:13,909
because we just sat around going well

1135
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:16,669
we're just put that on the bottom of the

1136
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:17,750
stack it took three months for planning

1137
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:21,740
staff to figure what they were

1138
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:23,750
evaluating right I mean this is all

1139
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:25,788
still so new for everyone and I think

1140
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:27,889
that that is that the I think the

1141
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:30,500
biggest challenge is that it's also new

1142
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:32,598
for everyone it's the regulations are

1143
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,900
new for the industry becoming like and I

1144
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:37,849
don't mean this is like you know he's

1145
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,950
not taking offense but becoming like a

1146
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:42,798
business like I know a lot of legacy

1147
00:46:39,949 --> 00:46:44,000
actors and yes they were a business but

1148
00:46:42,798 --> 00:46:45,409
they weren't really a

1149
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,719
business if you're in the cannabis

1150
00:46:45,409 --> 00:46:50,329
industry you're in the compliance

1151
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:55,009
industry is really what you what you are

1152
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:58,579
in now but it's also new I think for

1153
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:59,630
everyone it's just it's just a lot I

1154
00:46:58,579 --> 00:47:02,110
think everyone kind of feels like

1155
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:06,320
they're drinking out of the firehose and

1156
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:09,110
I get to kind of see it I see see it

1157
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:12,200
from every perspective yeah I just want

1158
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:13,460
to echo Joe sentiment you know part of

1159
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:16,429
the challenge in the city of Los Angeles

1160
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:19,130
is that you know folks want access to

1161
00:47:16,429 --> 00:47:21,019
licensure but in order for folks to even

1162
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:23,869
have access to licensure there needs to

1163
00:47:21,019 --> 00:47:27,170
be a licensing program and licensing

1164
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:30,440
programs don't pop out of thin air they

1165
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:32,510
need to be created and so for a city of

1166
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,030
4 million people with 15 different

1167
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:37,480
elected officials and 96 neighborhood

1168
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:41,570
councils there were a lot of different

1169
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:43,550
opinions to consider and I you know a

1170
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:46,550
lot a lot of the folks who were in this

1171
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:48,440
room or on one side of the spectrum most

1172
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:50,630
folks kind of fall in the middle of the

1173
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,039
bell curve and then you have you know

1174
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:55,059
folks on the other side that are

1175
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:58,219
completely opposed but I do think that

1176
00:47:55,059 --> 00:48:00,019
it has been difficult for elected

1177
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:01,449
officials and public administrators to

1178
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:03,829
deal with this issue

1179
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:07,250
cannabis is sexy for the folks in this

1180
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:08,869
room but as an elected official cannabis

1181
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:12,679
is not that sexy

1182
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:15,109
and you know no one wants to hang their

1183
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:18,489
hat on something that's not guaranteed

1184
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:21,890
in the success of this industry

1185
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:23,779
and the impacts of this industry are

1186
00:48:21,889 --> 00:48:26,569
well known when's the last time we

1187
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:30,400
legalized cannabis you know this is all

1188
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:32,840
new and so I appreciate folks like Joe

1189
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,360
like other elected officials who have

1190
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,610
taken leadership on these issues because

1191
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,750
it can be a real struggle and I think

1192
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,480
it's going to be important for the

1193
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:46,010
industry to actively participate and

1194
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:49,460
identify those champions at local

1195
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:51,110
federal and state levels because you

1196
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,639
know those are the folks who are going

1197
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:54,590
to be able to move the needle forward

1198
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:55,739
while everyone else has their either

1199
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:58,559
their heads in the same

1200
00:48:55,739 --> 00:49:00,509
they're sitting on their hands Pamela

1201
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,579
looks like you want to comment can't you

1202
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:04,650
made a great point and I think this is

1203
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:06,509
really important I served previously

1204
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,360
it's a special City Attorney for the

1205
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:10,560
city of Hollister drafting their

1206
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:13,079
regulatory program and their ordinance

1207
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,940
with them so I have a unique lens of

1208
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:17,569
looking at it from the city's

1209
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:20,340
perspective and from the operators be

1210
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:21,660
involved like Kat saying these programs

1211
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:25,320
don't happen overnight

1212
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:27,059
most of these a staff at cities never

1213
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,470
thought cannabis was something that was

1214
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:30,409
going to be part of their everyday

1215
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:34,109
rhetoric that they would have to

1216
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:37,500
understand let alone draft an ordinance

1217
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:39,900
so be that active participant if you

1218
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:42,210
want to operate in that City go in and

1219
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,970
meet with city staff go in and meet with

1220
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:47,340
the City Council members offer them a

1221
00:49:44,969 --> 00:49:49,289
suite of options sometimes we'll put

1222
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,850
together a package of the ordinances and

1223
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:54,570
the different languages that we thought

1224
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:58,380
for our operators work the best and then

1225
00:49:54,570 --> 00:50:00,660
proposed draft ordinance language I have

1226
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:02,340
drafted ordinances for several cities

1227
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:06,539
across the state on behalf of clients

1228
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:09,269
that gave a cheesesteak cheesecake style

1229
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:12,300
menu of operations is what we like to

1230
00:50:09,269 --> 00:50:13,858
call it we did a whole hog ordinance and

1231
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,300
we really focused in on what was

1232
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:17,130
important for the operators we

1233
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:20,190
represented and provided it as a

1234
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:23,519
baseline tool for discussion for that

1235
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:26,190
city or that County to use it is well

1236
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:27,750
received they want to understand if a

1237
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,760
city is dipping their toe into

1238
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:34,250
regulation and Kat and Joe are great

1239
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:37,050
it's a good opportunity to provide a

1240
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:39,358
meaningful information so they

1241
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:40,440
understand your process they understand

1242
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:43,170
what you're gonna go through as a

1243
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,599
business they understand how your

1244
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:48,450
business functions since it is different

1245
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,250
and new don't miss that opportunity it's

1246
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:51,689
critical if you come to them at the

1247
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:53,880
point of the application and you've

1248
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:56,670
never showed up at a meeting and you've

1249
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,670
never been engaged you're just a name on

1250
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:01,740
a piece of paper now they're converse is

1251
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:03,358
that is don't go in and think because

1252
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:06,179
you're providing these things you were

1253
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,920
guaranteed a license you are not don't

1254
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:08,759
go in and because the mayor is your

1255
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,590
friend think

1256
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,410
you've got nothing to worry about this

1257
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:16,730
is you in the bag that's not it this is

1258
00:51:13,409 --> 00:51:20,460
a purely providing information and

1259
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:22,139
shepherding the process and being a

1260
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,269
source of hey you know what these

1261
00:51:22,139 --> 00:51:26,579
regulations came out I don't really

1262
00:51:24,269 --> 00:51:29,099
what's going on there and updating them

1263
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:30,690
as that process unfolds I think other

1264
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:32,789
cities coming online is gonna take some

1265
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:39,059
time there's still political risk to

1266
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:42,179
this you look at how Prop 64 fared in a

1267
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:45,809
lot of these counties and a number of

1268
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:47,609
these cities and and it wasn't 60/40 it

1269
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:49,230
was a little bit closer to 5050 and

1270
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:50,340
there's not a lot of electeds that are

1271
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:52,889
willing to go out there and say hey you

1272
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:54,809
know what 5050 that's good enough I'm

1273
00:51:52,889 --> 00:51:56,849
gonna lead the charge on this one and

1274
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:57,960
risk my political career on it so I

1275
00:51:56,849 --> 00:52:00,029
think it's gonna take a little bit of

1276
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,670
time but what is going to delay that is

1277
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:06,150
going to be poor experiences by cities

1278
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:07,650
like Sacramento and Los Angeles if you

1279
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:09,990
know if and when things go wrong you

1280
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:13,470
know we've had a very positive

1281
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:17,399
experience so far and and I don't expect

1282
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:20,129
any but you know bad operators or poor

1283
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,840
operators or people over-promising in

1284
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:25,740
this space and under delivery and just

1285
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:28,470
as a as a whole I think potentially slow

1286
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:30,809
down that process my question is for Joe

1287
00:52:28,469 --> 00:52:32,639
Devlin my name is Jack McGowan in K

1288
00:52:30,809 --> 00:52:35,070
Street consulting I work a lot with Joe

1289
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,440
in the city of Sacramento and I love

1290
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:41,250
that the topic is about over-promising

1291
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:44,309
and under-delivering we had a City

1292
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:46,050
Council meeting back in May and it was

1293
00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:48,449
really hard for me to pick my jaw up off

1294
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:50,340
the floor when it felt like an arbitrary

1295
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:52,739
number of a hundred and forty thousand

1296
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:54,600
dollars was plucked out of the sky in

1297
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:56,369
order for a High Times to have an event

1298
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:59,789
and that was money that was promised to

1299
00:52:56,369 --> 00:53:03,839
community organizations and they also

1300
00:52:59,789 --> 00:53:07,590
promised a certain tax obligation to the

1301
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:09,450
city and they have a new event October

1302
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:11,670
31st that they started selling tickets

1303
00:53:09,449 --> 00:53:15,089
to that they didn't get local approval

1304
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:17,309
for so that items been removed from the

1305
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:19,079
agenda the obligations have not been

1306
00:53:17,309 --> 00:53:20,309
fulfilled and I want to know from you

1307
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:22,319
how does

1308
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:26,070
harm the rest of the industry in

1309
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:28,410
Sacramento given that we have a two-part

1310
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:31,410
problem now now that a hundred and forty

1311
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:33,750
thousand dollar mark has been made for

1312
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:36,539
any other event that wants to be thrown

1313
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:39,539
in in the city of Sacramento and we have

1314
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:41,809
a very big event organizer that has

1315
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:44,039
failed to own up to their obligations

1316
00:53:41,809 --> 00:53:47,549
the the date of the event I think is

1317
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:51,179
October 25th just so don't show up on

1318
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:55,830
Halloween but I believe that that number

1319
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:58,259
was proposed by bye-bye High Times

1320
00:53:55,829 --> 00:54:02,789
that wasn't a number that was pulled out

1321
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:04,650
of by the by the council they did make

1322
00:54:02,789 --> 00:54:06,690
good on their tax obligation to the city

1323
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:09,150
I don't know about their other

1324
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:14,610
commitments to to their community

1325
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:16,619
partners so I don't know it I think does

1326
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:18,960
leave a little bit of a kind of bad

1327
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:20,849
taste and and in the council's mouth if

1328
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,260
you will I mean we got really jammed the

1329
00:54:20,849 --> 00:54:25,079
first time they said hey we want to have

1330
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,880
this event pretty much tomorrow you know

1331
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:30,509
can you figure out a way to you know to

1332
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,860
have a guarantees local approval and we

1333
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:34,350
did it was the first one in the state

1334
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,640
and we said okay you know hey don't do

1335
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:38,690
that again can you like give us a little

1336
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:41,549
bit more advance warning and they didn't

1337
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:42,990
and so I don't know what's gonna happen

1338
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:47,550
with that event I don't know if they're

1339
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:48,839
gonna get local approval or not I think

1340
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:50,430
these types of events are gonna be

1341
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,930
treated as low but one offs I don't

1342
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:54,449
think it reflects necessarily on the

1343
00:54:51,929 --> 00:54:56,429
cannabis industry in in Sacramento

1344
00:54:54,449 --> 00:54:59,759
because they are there they're

1345
00:54:56,429 --> 00:55:02,419
transitory they're not part of our kind

1346
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:05,100
of local cannabis community if you will

1347
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:09,180
so I don't think it reflects poorly on

1348
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:10,559
Sacramento's cannabis industry but you

1349
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:12,319
know maybe a little bit on the industry

1350
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:15,599
as a whole

1351
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:17,190
hi my name is Sarah GRU and I wanted to

1352
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,789
something we see in a lot of other

1353
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:23,880
industries is producers and growers

1354
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:25,380
having direct access to consumers if

1355
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,180
you're in Sonoma County you can go to

1356
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,680
cowgirl Creamery you can see them make

1357
00:55:27,179 --> 00:55:30,750
cheese you can buy some cheese and bread

1358
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:32,250
and carry on and you can go to an

1359
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,780
orchard and you can buy a pound of

1360
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:36,599
apples you could go to a bin

1361
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:39,600
you can taste the wine and we don't have

1362
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:41,489
that opportunity in cannabis yet we did

1363
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:45,420
see a step in that direction with a bill

1364
00:55:41,489 --> 00:55:47,609
this year allowing for temporary retail

1365
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:50,909
licenses for small and mid-sized

1366
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:53,070
producers or farmers to get a temporary

1367
00:55:50,909 --> 00:55:54,989
permit to then be at an event like a big

1368
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:57,269
you know cannabis event an emerald cup

1369
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:59,939
or you know the farmers market kind of

1370
00:55:57,269 --> 00:56:01,949
thing so I'm curious what you all think

1371
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,389
of this sort of you know how we can

1372
00:56:01,949 --> 00:56:05,969
bring this into the fold with cannabis

1373
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:08,699
if you did or didn't support that bill

1374
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:11,250
and why like we talked about yesterday

1375
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:13,159
when we couldn't consume where we had a

1376
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:15,380
problem with consumption on the boat

1377
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:17,849
here on the Queen Mary the ship

1378
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:19,890
correction you these are things that

1379
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:21,869
need to be discussed the event licensed

1380
00:56:19,889 --> 00:56:25,190
the event organiser in the event license

1381
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:28,500
that the BCC created has some

1382
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:30,780
fundamental issues we saw two bills

1383
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,909
going through the legislature 26:41 in

1384
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:35,640
2020 which we're still waiting for the

1385
00:56:32,909 --> 00:56:38,250
governor impatiently waiting to sign

1386
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:40,349
some of those bills it's an active and

1387
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:42,840
ongoing conversation I think it should

1388
00:56:40,349 --> 00:56:45,389
be a legislative priority for next year

1389
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,280
to figure out how we can get back to the

1390
00:56:45,389 --> 00:56:50,969
cannabis culture that was the foundation

1391
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,730
of how we got here was this direct

1392
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:56,250
interaction with with brands to

1393
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:59,219
consumers but that's an agenda you have

1394
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:00,900
to make those position points when the

1395
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:02,549
regulations came out and the draft

1396
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,990
permanent regulations came out it works

1397
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:06,900
with clients about putting better

1398
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:09,809
language in these are real concerns

1399
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:11,910
they're affecting everybody and I think

1400
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:13,739
if we see 20/20 move forward that's a

1401
00:57:11,909 --> 00:57:17,429
step in the right direction do we still

1402
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:19,919
have a long way to go I think so to get

1403
00:57:17,429 --> 00:57:22,319
back to where we were right we want to

1404
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,869
get back to stasis in a regulated way we

1405
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:29,250
have to do it pragmatically I think it's

1406
00:57:24,869 --> 00:57:30,869
a real concern for retailers to think

1407
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:34,679
about if they're gonna be the sole

1408
00:57:30,869 --> 00:57:37,980
retailer for an event you got to pick

1409
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:39,149
your classification for licensing

1410
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:41,579
because all of a sudden you run

1411
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:43,650
everything through your dispensary for a

1412
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:45,389
big event you may have said oh I think

1413
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:46,559
I'm gonna make X number of dollars to

1414
00:57:45,389 --> 00:57:48,150
pay my annual

1415
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,549
the way the fee structure works right

1416
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:52,920
now you would pay a penalty and then

1417
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,630
half of the other fee so it's something

1418
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,900
that we got to think about and work

1419
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:59,190
through it's a long game but if we see

1420
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,260
some development that'll be great

1421
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:02,909
unfortunately for now we have to live

1422
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,980
under the regulations as they are and

1423
00:58:02,909 --> 00:58:07,139
doing those types of events are hard I

1424
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:09,420
see a lot of them Eric I think that you

1425
00:58:07,139 --> 00:58:11,609
did you have something that you wanted

1426
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:15,539
to add yeah I think there's a little bit

1427
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:16,140
of the cart before the horse going on

1428
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:20,820
here

1429
00:58:16,139 --> 00:58:24,869
if instead of looking at apple orchards

1430
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:27,960
as the comparison set or even cannabis

1431
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:29,730
back in the pre regulated environment

1432
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,610
look at things like beer and alcohol

1433
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:34,769
where you're not allowed to just roll up

1434
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:38,579
and do a beer event without getting a

1435
00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:45,090
permit this is cannabis so the idea that

1436
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:48,299
you want to have a sorry sure and you

1437
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:50,730
can go to a micro licensed facility in

1438
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:53,010
Los Angeles there are several of them

1439
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:55,170
and you can buy what they're making

1440
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:56,910
there there are places called show grow

1441
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:58,349
that are showing you what they're

1442
00:58:56,909 --> 00:59:00,899
growing and then they're making them and

1443
00:58:58,349 --> 00:59:03,000
that and so the idea of doing it is

1444
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:05,039
there I think what people are reacting

1445
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,530
to it hasn't flushed through the system

1446
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:10,500
so there aren't a lot of those just like

1447
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:12,269
there aren't a lot of micro breweries

1448
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,730
where you can walk up and do it that

1449
00:59:12,269 --> 00:59:16,980
evolved over a 10 or 15 year period

1450
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:20,340
I think there's clearly market demand

1451
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:22,500
for it back my comment if it's a lot for

1452
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:25,019
everybody it's gonna take a little bit

1453
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:28,260
more time to I think really kind of

1454
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:29,759
flesh out like you know how that would

1455
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,710
actually work and really get to a place

1456
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:37,410
where I mean the legislature is gonna

1457
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:40,260
pass it really quick so completely

1458
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:42,389
that's I mean as a cannabis culture and

1459
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:44,160
having these facilities and as other

1460
00:59:42,389 --> 00:59:45,750
wineries in Sonoma and all that stuff

1461
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:47,969
but what's really kind of important to

1462
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:50,130
understand is ok where we're at right

1463
00:59:47,969 --> 00:59:51,989
now in regards to your question but what

1464
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:53,670
did it take to get to this position so

1465
00:59:51,989 --> 00:59:55,949
for example here in the city of Long

1466
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:57,360
Beach we did two ballot initiatives in

1467
00:59:55,949 --> 00:59:58,899
the city of Long Beach and we have to

1468
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,640
reach out to the voters to talk to

1469
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,200
the whole entire in tempers we're

1470
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,449
talking about we want to bring in retail

1471
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:06,669
stores to allow safe access to patients

1472
01:00:04,449 --> 01:00:08,439
so we're sitting here and we're having

1473
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:10,300
you know we're talking about safe access

1474
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,700
with retail we're going to the voters

1475
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:15,039
Prop 64 they're thinking retail retail

1476
01:00:12,699 --> 01:00:18,460
and right now potentially to come in

1477
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:20,409
open up other sources without some sort

1478
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,240
of understanding the functions of how

1479
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:24,250
that's going to I think it's eventually

1480
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:26,259
it's gonna go there but you know we've

1481
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:27,750
been telling the the public out large

1482
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:29,710
hey we're trying to get safe access

1483
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:32,289
retailers maybe brick-and-mortar

1484
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:33,970
deliveries and other options but it's

1485
01:00:32,289 --> 01:00:36,150
also what we've been educating the

1486
01:00:33,969 --> 01:00:38,529
public on and then now to come

1487
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:40,570
potentially without really vetting it

1488
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:42,490
and bringing in different licenses that

1489
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,170
would go direct to the farmers market or

1490
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:46,449
whatever it is I think it just requires

1491
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:48,190
more time in the eyes of cat and some of

1492
01:00:46,449 --> 01:00:50,319
you might be looked at as a guy in the

1493
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:51,670
illicit market this is about first of

1494
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,769
all I think the mistake is we're making

1495
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:54,880
alcohol the same as cannabis we're

1496
01:00:53,769 --> 01:00:56,559
looking at it even though they find out

1497
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,180
alcohol is really bad for you so maybe

1498
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,440
we should do some adjustment there but

1499
01:00:58,179 --> 01:01:01,210
my second mic real question is about

1500
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,980
phase three me and my wife have been

1501
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:04,300
operating a non storefront delivery for

1502
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,010
the last year and a half and we've been

1503
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,200
helping a lot of people majority medical

1504
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:09,760
majority in their 50s and older my

1505
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:11,619
question is what do you tell somebody

1506
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,990
who's been in this industry like most

1507
01:01:11,619 --> 01:01:15,759
people in the illicit market for the

1508
01:01:13,989 --> 01:01:18,250
last eight years helping farmers bring

1509
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,840
down medicine to distributors putting

1510
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,849
their life in line have guns pulled and

1511
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,780
then maybe to not have the rug pulled

1512
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:24,190
out from underneath their feet when

1513
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:25,720
phase three happen so what can you tell

1514
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:27,940
somebody who's right now operating and

1515
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:29,169
serving people and who's here today to

1516
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:30,579
try to get some more information cat

1517
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:31,450
this direction this is to you and just

1518
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:33,069
the fact that we're all here is

1519
01:01:31,449 --> 01:01:34,389
beautiful by the way it's awesome the

1520
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:39,160
first thing that I'd say is that you

1521
01:01:34,389 --> 01:01:42,759
shouldn't be operating we have a system

1522
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:46,299
that's been set in place by state of

1523
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:48,130
California by the city of Los Angeles my

1524
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:51,490
job is to administer and enforce those

1525
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:52,660
rules so that be my first statement the

1526
01:01:51,489 --> 01:01:55,599
second statement I'd say is good luck

1527
01:01:52,659 --> 01:01:57,969
and I want to work with all operators

1528
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:01,809
who are coming to try to be a part of

1529
01:01:57,969 --> 01:02:05,019
the process I get questions every single

1530
01:02:01,809 --> 01:02:07,619
day about Phase three I was getting

1531
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:12,199
questions about Phase three in January

1532
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:14,328
and the truth of the matter is is again

1533
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:17,118
you know folks want priority processing

1534
01:02:14,329 --> 01:02:18,680
to licensing but if there's no licensing

1535
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,608
system if there's no licensing

1536
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:25,730
infrastructure it would be a disservice

1537
01:02:21,608 --> 01:02:30,108
for me to open phase three today without

1538
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:33,858
proper infrastructure in place I want to

1539
01:02:30,108 --> 01:02:36,318
see the long-term sustainability and

1540
01:02:33,858 --> 01:02:38,659
viability of this industry I want to see

1541
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:42,079
this industry succeed I want to see this

1542
01:02:38,659 --> 01:02:44,088
industry be responsible and it's my job

1543
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,950
to administer and enforce the policies

1544
01:02:44,088 --> 01:02:51,440
that have been set in place by our mayor

1545
01:02:45,949 --> 01:02:55,338
and our City Council so I hear in your

1546
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:57,048
chest your frustration and what I tell

1547
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:59,630
you as a regulator is that you should

1548
01:02:57,048 --> 01:03:03,139
not be operating I'm in the same boat

1549
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:11,358
right like and and I don't exactly know

1550
01:03:03,139 --> 01:03:16,940
what phase three is a I've got enough

1551
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:18,440
problems but but look I mean like I wake

1552
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:20,539
up every day with like a little bit of

1553
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:23,000
pressure feeling somewhat responsible

1554
01:03:20,539 --> 01:03:25,460
maybe a lot responsible for essentially

1555
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:29,780
the rollout of cannabis in a city that I

1556
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:32,000
love right that's and and you got

1557
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:35,359
politicians you got neighbors you got

1558
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,059
industry like all poking at you and and

1559
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:39,828
like we're literally in the middle of

1560
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:41,150
all of this I've had I've had some

1561
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:42,380
really cool jobs I've had some really

1562
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:45,440
hard jobs this is a hardest job I've

1563
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:49,548
ever had in my entire life by far right

1564
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:52,970
and like and yeah I've had some hard

1565
01:03:49,548 --> 01:03:55,039
jobs but we're in the middle of all of

1566
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:57,769
this and I think what at least I'm

1567
01:03:55,039 --> 01:04:00,349
attempting to do is you know make sure

1568
01:03:57,769 --> 01:04:02,030
that that the decisions that we're

1569
01:04:00,349 --> 01:04:05,539
making are not arbitrary and capricious

1570
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:08,900
that there's that there's a clear path

1571
01:04:05,539 --> 01:04:11,449
for that is really accessible to the

1572
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:13,519
existing cannabis industry to make that

1573
01:04:11,449 --> 01:04:16,129
legal transition to make sure that those

1574
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:17,469
markets are accessible to the consumer

1575
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:20,630
because at the end of the day that's

1576
01:04:17,469 --> 01:04:24,099
that's what is going to make this this

1577
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:26,920
whole thing work and make it sustainable

1578
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:29,500
and there are gonna absolutely be people

1579
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:32,230
that are gonna go extinct that aren't

1580
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:34,559
gonna make it there gonna be people are

1581
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:36,519
going to come into this industry that

1582
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:39,579
everyone in this room is probably gonna

1583
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:45,489
hate right fill in the blank giant

1584
01:04:39,579 --> 01:04:47,349
corporation they're coming but you know

1585
01:04:45,489 --> 01:04:48,819
as one of the things that again we're

1586
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:50,349
trying to do is make sure this is

1587
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:52,330
accessible for the people that are here

1588
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:55,210
help them make that transition and

1589
01:04:52,329 --> 01:05:00,069
provide open markets to the consumers so

1590
01:04:55,210 --> 01:05:02,530
you all can be successful since I didn't

1591
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:04,120
get an opportunity to discuss a b-26 41

1592
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:06,580
and I know that question was for the

1593
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:09,489
elephant in the room so I would love to

1594
01:05:06,579 --> 01:05:11,319
address it if we have a minute

1595
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:13,599
the problem with that bill from our

1596
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:16,660
standpoint was you're talking about four

1597
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,949
events a year four days a year looking

1598
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:20,049
at the amount of sales that could happen

1599
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:21,399
and that was four events per year we

1600
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:23,350
were looking around twenty to

1601
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,570
twenty-five pounds being sold by a

1602
01:05:23,349 --> 01:05:27,670
farmer if you're a 10,000 square foot

1603
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:30,430
farmer and you're producing about 1,100

1604
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:32,079
pounds a year or anywhere from 700 we

1605
01:05:30,429 --> 01:05:34,269
were looking at a small proportion of

1606
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:36,579
your harvest going into a

1607
01:05:34,269 --> 01:05:38,050
direct-to-consumer sale a lot of people

1608
01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:40,539
were saying well what is the economics

1609
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:42,280
behind that well currently as a retailer

1610
01:05:40,539 --> 01:05:44,050
you would have to have 24-hour

1611
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,820
surveillance over every single

1612
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:48,340
transaction you'd have to hold it for 90

1613
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:50,410
days if you transfer from a cultivator

1614
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:52,510
to a distributor that product cannot be

1615
01:05:50,409 --> 01:05:54,099
redistributed back to the cultivator of

1616
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:57,250
which would have to be destroyed there

1617
01:05:54,099 --> 01:06:01,299
was a lot of problems inside the the

1618
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:03,460
kind of I guess temporary retail permit

1619
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,840
that the cost of compliance was not

1620
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,880
looking like it was going to be

1621
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:08,440
beneficial then what it would take to

1622
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,930
get the amount of margin that would be

1623
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:13,510
made at that direct-to-consumer sale

1624
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:16,089
plus that bill only allowed you to sell

1625
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:18,070
at that Fairgrounds well there was

1626
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:21,579
currently only 19 available in the state

1627
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:24,010
so we're fighting for 19 locations with

1628
01:06:21,579 --> 01:06:26,829
4 events a year to sell 20 pounds as a

1629
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:29,140
cultivator well from our standpoint the

1630
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:31,539
cost of compliance with too high and the

1631
01:06:29,139 --> 01:06:33,190
bill was kind of a ruse to say we wanted

1632
01:06:31,539 --> 01:06:35,340
to make sure you had access but at what

1633
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:37,570
cost was that access going to be there

1634
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:39,579
that's why as an organization

1635
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:41,530
we supported 2020 which is a bill that

1636
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:43,420
allowed retailers to continue to operate

1637
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:45,370
in their position it doesn't mean

1638
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:47,289
they're taking a 50% markup of your

1639
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:49,779
product it just means they are they are

1640
01:06:47,289 --> 01:06:52,059
just the fundamental people doing the

1641
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:54,400
transaction so a lot of the economics of

1642
01:06:52,059 --> 01:06:55,509
this didn't pan out a lot of the people

1643
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,220
saying that this was something they

1644
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:59,290
become accustomed to over time to be

1645
01:06:57,219 --> 01:07:01,149
able to sell direct to consumer well you

1646
01:06:59,289 --> 01:07:03,519
can't go in a parking lot in Arcata

1647
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:05,050
anymore and set up a ten by ten pop-up

1648
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,519
tent and sell direct to consumers

1649
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:09,220
anymore you'd have to go to a

1650
01:07:06,519 --> 01:07:11,530
fairgrounds with a with a with a with an

1651
01:07:09,219 --> 01:07:13,989
actual event pay the dues pay the fees

1652
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:15,910
and pay the cost of compliance and the

1653
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:17,229
maybe the liabilities of bringing too

1654
01:07:15,909 --> 01:07:18,639
much product to that event that you

1655
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:22,119
would have to destroy not give it back

1656
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:23,170
that was what was it was posed to a lot

1657
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:25,210
of the people that this was going to

1658
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:27,309
help smaller farmers but the economics

1659
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:29,769
of what went into that wasn't really

1660
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:31,179
just disclosed I think to a lot of group

1661
01:07:29,769 --> 01:07:32,800
and that's where our group look at the

1662
01:07:31,179 --> 01:07:34,750
economics of and said you know what

1663
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,430
there is a bill that expands access and

1664
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:38,170
expands the number of locations there's

1665
01:07:36,429 --> 01:07:40,029
another bill that limits the number of

1666
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:42,010
locations and limits retailers being

1667
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:44,530
able to kind of do their job which is

1668
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:47,950
what this what's more there's 22 license

1669
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:50,680
types did we need a 23rd so I just want

1670
01:07:47,949 --> 01:07:52,359
to take a moment to thank all of our

1671
01:07:50,679 --> 01:07:54,099
panelists I think that this has been a

1672
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,930
very interesting and enlightening

1673
01:07:54,099 --> 01:07:58,380
conversation so can we give our

1674
01:07:55,929 --> 01:08:02,168
panelists a round of applause

1675
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:02,169
[Applause]

1676
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:20,248
