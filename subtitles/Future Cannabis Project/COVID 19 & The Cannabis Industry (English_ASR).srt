2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:13,230
good afternoon or evening depending on

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,790
where you may be we are here today I

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,440
want to thank everybody first of all for

5
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,299
joining us on relatively short notice

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,600
all of our attendees and of course all

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,490
of our wonderful presenters as well we

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,929
are doing this because we have heard a

9
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:26,969
lot of consternation within the

10
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:29,309
Association around some of these issues

11
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,710
certainly the nature of essential

12
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:34,619
businesses what that means for our

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,230
clients what it means for whether they

14
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,699
should or have to stay open what it

15
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:40,159
means for their liabilities and then

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,840
also what it means for their bottom line

17
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,419
we've also heard a lot of sort of issues

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,940
around you know especially from our

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,850
perspective as people that that hosts

20

in-person educational events a lot of

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,800
issues around force majeure clauses how

22
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:57,750
those affect our business how those

23
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,269
affect the sort of larger conference

24
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,488
business within cannabis but also how

25
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,850
those all affect supply chain concert

26
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:08,129
contracts as well I want to start with a

27
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:10,169
just a brief disclaimer we did put this

28
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:12,390
this sort of presentation together very

29
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,060
last minute and so this is not legal

30
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,219
advice this is five attorneys that are

31
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,500
online talking about issues that we're

32
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:20,938
seeing from my perspective that I'm

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,978
seeing among the membership and from the

34
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:24,539
other four attorneys perspective they're

35
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:27,450
seeing what their businesses this is not

36
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,219
legal advice if you have questions about

37
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,469

00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:38,250
advice so you know please don't take

41
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,839
this totally at face value but this is

42
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,328
sort of what we're seeing going on in

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,728
the industry in terms of a general

44
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:46,798
overview one of the major issues that

45
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,810
we've seen pop up especially over the

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,820
last week or so is the nature of

47
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,759
essential businesses and what that means

48
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:56,218
both for retail consumer facing

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,420
businesses as well as those businesses

50
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:59,938
that are further back on the supply

51
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,599
chain so farmers distributors other

52
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:05,069
critical aspects of that infrastructure

53
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:07,169
we have a couple people here that that

54
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:09,299
have been sort of directly engaged in a

55
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,128
couple of those frontline fights before

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,620
we get into that discussion I just want

57
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:15,750
to quickly introduce everybody

58
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,890
we have for 104 attorneys as I mentioned

59
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,049
here with us today

60
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:21,268
we have Laura Caro who is of course one

61
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:23,580
of our founding members she was one of

62
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:26,759
our three founders she's a lawyer in San

63
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,989
Francisco with LPS law and one of the

64
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,609
reasons that she's here today is she

65
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,400
represents the Berkeley patients group

66
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,019
that was involved with a minor tips with

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,150
the city of the City of Berkeley over

68
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:38,519
what an essential business means and

69
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,829
really whether or not that would allow

70
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,030
for the full spectrum of their services

71
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:44,219
or whether they would need to be

72
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,489
curtailed in in response to the Cova

73
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:50,579
crisis we have Elizabeth Elizabeth is a

74
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:53,189
new attorney with Clark Howell she is

75

79
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:03,539
of course she's over in New York with

80
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:05,370
Hitler PC again just a wonderful

81
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:07,739
contributor to all of our educational

82
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,200
content last and certainly not least we

83
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,079
have Lauren Mendelsohn Lauren is with

84
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,060
the law offices of Omar Figueroa up in

85
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,459
Northern California and of course works

86
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,159
very very closely with a lot of the

87
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,469
legacy operators up there and has just a

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,180
great set of knowledge around the

89
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,979
industry and sort of what the immediate

90
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,569
effects of what's going on with this

91
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:32,039
crisis have so I think the the place

92
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:34,798
that I wanted to start with was just

93
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,500
sort of a general a general discussion

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,469
about what hope it means for businesses

95
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,479
normally whether or not businesses are

96
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:46,250
sort of facing any potential liability

97
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,568
coming out of COBIT for you know putting

98
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,269
potentially employees at risk that are

99
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:54,000
consumer facing you know I know that my

100
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,009
impression of this is that there is some

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,530
liability for employers that choose to

102
00:03:56,009 --> 00:04:01,259
remain open for instance the California

103
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,378
order has given essential businesses the

104
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:06,179
option but not the mandate to stay open

105
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:07,739
and so of course this has left some room

106
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,540
for businesses to close if they feel

107
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,699
that that is appropriate for them it's

108
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:14,370
also left some businesses for some room

109
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:19,579
for cannabis businesses to stay open and

110
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:22,168
so generally under OSHA liability is

111
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,120
there is some liability for employers if

112
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:26,158
you put your employees in a position

113
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,180
that puts them in an increased level of

114
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:29,788
harm

115
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,350
or what's reasonable and so I think that

116
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:33,870
it in this case given the larger

117
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,310
pandemic there is some liability

118
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,709
associated with potentially leaving your

119
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,319
business open and then I think that

120
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:41,939
that's maybe lessened a little bit with

121
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,339
respect to the idea that these are

122
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:47,370
essential businesses so as long as those

123
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:49,469
businesses are adhering to guidelines

124
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,680
set forth by the CDC other government

125
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,930
entities that there is some measure of a

126
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,459
reasonable expectation that they won't

127
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,709
be held liable as long as they're not

128
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:00,870
negligent do you guys have anything sort

129
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:02,728
of to add to that or is anyone seeing

130
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,060
any specific issues over businesses

131
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:08,098
being concerned about remaining open or

132
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,199
or how that might sort of affect them

133
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:14,098
down down the road Laura do you have

134
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:16,439
anything to say about that one yeah me

135
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:18,000
yeah sure I mean yeah yeah this is a

136
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,348
whole I mean like any other business

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,560
that remains open I think that everybody

138
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:24,329
has a lot of concern people are bending

139
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,339
over backwards trying to experiment with

140
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:28,409
and reach out to other people about what

141
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,810
they're doing to try to protect not only

142
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,760
their customers but their employees and

143
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,370
their vendors that come on-site to

144
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,098
deliver we're getting updated

145
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,530
information by the minute on how long

146
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:44,370
people believe that this really remain

147
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:46,888
on a surface and so different protocols

148
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,780
are shifting I could continuously but

149
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,210
yeah I think with regard to any kind of

150
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,469
existing long-term liability it's

151
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:54,239
definitely in the forefront of all of

152
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,190
these employers mind some particularly

153
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,870
in a time when we're trying to make sure

154
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,370
that we're one maintaining access to

155
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,720
something that a lot of us perceived to

156
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:06,750
be extremely vital particularly now and

157
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,930
you know and keep people fed and housed

158
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,668
and make sure that we don't increase the

159
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,530
burden on the housing and security that

160
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:16,228
we have particularly in the Bay Area and

161
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:19,948
then you know just trying to balance all

162
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:21,779
of that with your insurance company and

163
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,000
the federal government aid and

164
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:26,309
everything else it's coming at you yeah

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,228
I would say that there's a lot of a lot

166
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,550
of concern for potential liability down

167
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:31,500
the road we started talking about

168
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,889
workman's comp claims the second that's

169
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,490
started coming down

170
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:39,620
that you know we have been giving advice

171
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,718
with respect to SOPs and updating SOPs

172
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,999
not only to follow the state laws but

173
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:46,998
also local orders and in different

174
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:48,409
safety and sanitation measures that

175
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:50,629
might be particular that local

176
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,069
jurisdiction we've also been encouraging

177
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:54,379
our clients to collaborate with

178
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:56,900
specialists including legal specialists

179
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:59,360
in employment law when they're drafting

180
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:02,870
these SOPs because there are you know

181
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,098
many legal issues triggered by this and

182
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,879
you know there was a federal law

183
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:10,339
extending you know paid family we passed

184
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,620
in the last few weeks and there's a lot

185
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:15,318
of intricacies to untangle so I think

186
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,120
that you know not only is revising those

187
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,669
SOPs with an eye toward you know your

188
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,788
operations and safety but also making

189
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:24,709
sure that there's you know an underlying

190
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:26,360
legal strategy there just to make sure

191
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,250
that you're protected your employees are

192
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:33,889
protected and you're taking a holistic

193
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:35,838
view of your response to Kovac 19 a lot

194
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:37,490
of businesses especially in the more

195
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:40,158
competitive Medical Marijuana states

196
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,389
definitely should have contemplated some

197
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:43,728
sort of safety plan in connection with

198
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:45,139
their application so we do see people

199
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:46,609
sort of referring to their internal

200
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:48,710
policies making sure that they follow

201
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,360
the policy because sometimes it doesn't

202
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,799
matter what your policy is it only

203
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,960
matters if you don't follow your own

204
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,278
policy so it's super important to check

205
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,838
your existing policies and make sure

206
00:07:55,278 --> 00:07:59,180
that you're following that because then

207
00:07:56,838 --> 00:08:00,800
not only could you expand you face

208
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,149
exposure under OSHA but you also could

209
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,139
have you know sort of an internal

210
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:07,310
employment issue on your hands as an

211
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:09,918
industry as a whole it would just

212
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,228
reflect poorly if we were to be

213
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,959
responsible for getting folks sick right

214
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:17,149
and so it is important that we protect

215
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:20,838
your employees and the and the customers

216
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:23,629
that you see and proper PPE proper

217
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:25,610
sanitization procedures keeping distance

218
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,800
within you know if you are having

219
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,538
employees go into a particular space

220
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,060
like a manufacturing facility or

221
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:33,288
something like that um it's just super

222
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:35,478
important that we're thinking about the

223
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:37,098
larger picture here and that that's more

224
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,269
important right now than your bottom

225
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,459
line it has to be we're in a global

226
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:42,649
pandemic and you have to adjust your

227
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,899
procedures accordingly and go into your

228
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:46,220
emergency mode I think that that's been

229
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,389
the biggest struggle that balance you

230
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,649
know between

231
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:50,029
a small business owner and wanting to

232
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:51,590
protect your employees and knowing that

233
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,120
the economics are going to impact them

234
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,580
and have far-ranging decisions beyond

235
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,230
just Ovid 19 you know maybe their access

236
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,730
to health care depends on them having a

237
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,379
job and if there is no job then they

238
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,670
can't have health care in the future you

239
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:03,889
know so this balance I think has

240
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:06,319
definitely been the hardest part for all

241
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:07,699
of my clients anyway and underscoring

242
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,850
what Lauren said you know we've been

243
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,230
trying to emphasize that you know it's

244
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,409
quite remarkable that Candice has gone

245
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,420
from an illegal market to part of the

246
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:18,919
essential health care supply chain and

247
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:21,259
so you know we've been encouraging our

248
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:22,849
clients don't only you know do right by

249
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:26,210
themselves in their employees but to be

250
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,500
like the model supply chain operators

251
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,300
you know like make sure they're going

252
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,059
above and beyond make sure they're

253
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:34,159
establishing a dialogue between you know

254
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:36,409
their leadership and local jurisdiction

255
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:40,279
just to make sure they are able to speak

256
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:42,529
to any safety concerns you know to I

257
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,629
guess have a say in any you know

258
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:46,490
surprise orders that may be more you

259
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:47,570
know more restrictive because local

260
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,419
jurisdictions are doing that all the

261
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:53,690
time and you know we in the last few

262
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:55,909
weeks we've seen an influx of articles

263
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:59,060
from opposition groups you know implying

264
00:09:55,909 --> 00:10:02,689
that cannabis should not be a part a

265
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:03,979
central healthcare supply chain so you

266
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,630
know just really important to remember

267
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,370
that we're all in this together you know

268
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:11,120
it's a community it's a really big

269
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,830
moment for no cannabis in general yes

270
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,539
and in that connection States you know

271
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,850
we represent for example a dispensary in

272
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:18,589
North Carolina you know it's sometimes

273
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,790
incumbent upon the business owners to

274
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,680
reach out to those representatives and

275
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:23,120
make sure that cannabis is held as

276
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:24,439
essential and you know that mitigation

277
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,600
efforts are taken to stop the spread of

278
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,710
disease and what's been very helpful for

279
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,230
us are the guidelines that were

280
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,430
published by Americans for safe access

281
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,590
you know they did send a very compelling

282
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:34,789
letter to the various jurisdictions in

283
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,980
the medical and I don't use cannabis

284
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:39,259
States encouraging them to keep these

285
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,879
businesses open so for anyone looking

286
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:42,799
for language to incorporate into some

287
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,860
sort of policy document or effort to

288
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:48,109
convince somebody that these businesses

289
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,480
are essential then look to the ASI

290
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,680
guidance for that I mean do that and I

291
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,539
mean Elizabeth was saying this is kind

292
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,009
of a pivotal moment for us but you know

293
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:56,839
we're really relying on the arguments

294
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:58,179
that we made in order to get here in the

295
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,360
first place

296
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:03,659
this is really underscoring you know our

297
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:08,950
the necessity that we maintain medicinal

298
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:13,179
you know as a as a an active part of our

299
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:15,430
community and not disregard the benefits

300
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:19,389
that it brings to our community we're

301
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:23,319
really seeing you know how the potential

302
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:25,899
for a lack of access really galvanized a

303
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,200
whole team of people who grew up through

304
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:31,330
this industry and I think we're in large

305
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,129
part responsible for turning around some

306
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,459
of the more conservative policies that

307
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:38,860
tried to deem cannabis a non-essential

308
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:42,759
product because it is essential for a

309
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,990
lot of people that we work with and like

310
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,330
there's two things in there that I

311
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:49,839
wanted to discuss and one is like about

312
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:52,300
the designation of it being medical

313
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,860
cannabis right versus adult use cannabis

314
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:56,289
and you see different jurisdictions

315
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,589
allowing it only for medical operators

316
00:11:56,289 --> 00:12:04,480
can keep operating some don't specify

317
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:05,980
and I think that you know people I am

318
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,170
I'm of the view as many people are that

319
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,610
all uses medical use in a way right if

320
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:11,439
you're smoking joints because it helps

321
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,269
you calm down someone else might take an

322
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,279
anti-anxiety medication for that right

323
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,360
so you are getting a medical benefit

324
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:17,889
from that there's over-the-counter

325
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,269
medicines think of this as an

326
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:21,220
over-the-counter medicine you don't need

327
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:23,708
a prescription to that and so I think

328
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,660
what we want to avoid is getting

329
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:28,119
ourselves trapped into a situation where

330
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:29,679
only folks who go have an official you

331
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,350
know card or have a doctor's

332
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,849
recommendation only they can get this

333
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,170
medicine because there's many reasons

334
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,420
why someone might be a legitimate

335
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:39,278
patient or and you have a legitimate

336
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:41,289
medical needs and not have gone through

337
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,970
that expensive time-consuming difficult

338
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:44,828
process of getting a doctor's

339
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,980
recommendation or a card and so in

340
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:50,708
California for example certain counties

341
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:53,620
have specified in cities that it can

342
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:55,869
only be medical retailers can keep

343
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,970
operating you know via delivery or

344
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,980
curbside pickup and that's been

345
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,690
interpreted different ways and in

346
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,490
different places and a lot of folks who

347
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,420
are freaking out against Sonoma County

348
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:09,700
for example where I live we our County

349
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:12,250
issue to stay at home order before the

350
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,690
statewide one did a few days earlier and

351
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:17,470
we have actually been in communication

352
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,420
with the county to urge that they

353
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,310
consider cannabis to be essential for

354
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:22,809
all of these reasons and so when they

355
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:24,879
publish their order are they listen to

356
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:26,289
us that they added in that medical only

357
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,330
restriction and we're like we'll shoot

358
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:29,980
we are talking about in our argument how

359
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,990
it's so important medically but now have

360
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,730
we unwittingly put this restriction in

361
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,350
there that they're going to be you know

362
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,450
policing who is going and buying this

363
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,310
product so long story short I've had

364
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,620
conversations with the Health Officer

365
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:44,829
and that was the intent was not to shut

366
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:47,560
down any existing businesses or put

367
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,840
people out of business or police who's

368
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,479
buying these products really the point

369
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,450
is social distancing and you know

370
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,980
preventing the spread of the virus and

371
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:59,650
you know their view it and this is that

372
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,899
Quan County's view is essentially what I

373
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:02,980
said earlier is that uses medical use

374
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:04,629
all of these products could

375
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,279
theoretically be medical cannabis

376
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:08,350
products anyone could theoretically have

377
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,539
a medical use that's one County's view

378
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,149
other counties might have a very

379
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:14,860
different view the state didn't specify

380
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:17,110
the state left and vague which was

381
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:20,200
really great and myself and a bunch of

382
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:22,720
other people had been writing to to this

383
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,240
to gavin newsom Sophos ahead of time to

384
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,670
request that he specify what cannabis

385
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,039
businesses that they'd be a design is

386
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:32,229
essential so that's just kind of go to

387
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:34,299
go show of how you can be involved with

388
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,730
local and state levels to make sure that

389
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:38,409
we do have it in writing so it's just a

390
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,570
little more clear and have some clarity

391
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:42,730
about how our businesses can move

392
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:45,550
forward and I think it's so amazing how

393
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:48,639
far far the industry has come from being

394
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:50,439
criminalized to being essential in just

395
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,629
a few short years it's it's quite

396
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,110
remarkable and the ability to keep these

397
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:58,899
businesses open keep people working keep

398
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:02,440
the just it's that's very important too

399
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:07,509
so that's kind of just what I wanted to

400
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:09,339
say there I was gonna say the sequence

401
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:12,939
of events right what happened we played

402
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:15,550
out in the Bay Area anyway in the state

403
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,260
of California right we had this order

404
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:19,689
come down on the 16th which was really

405
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:21,189
kind of scary for a lot of people but we

406
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,680
all started looking up code sections

407
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,899
that we were unfamiliar with immediately

408
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:28,079
and everybody's looking for you know

409
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:32,759
their their industry segment it is

410
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,470
essential and you know we we felt like

411
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,860
we had identified in healthcare and

412
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:41,129
retails of the areas that were essential

413
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:44,159
and then in San Francisco our Department

414
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:45,778
of Public Health decided we were not and

415
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,909
it took us a good 24 hours of some

416
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,250
seriously solid social pressure on the

417
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:52,199
Department of Public Health to

418
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,669
completely pivot on that point

419
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,920
two days later I think it was on the

420
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:58,349
20th Gavin Newsom actually did publish

421
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:02,039
some additional guidance on what was

422
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:04,350
going on and cannabis is listed

423
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:07,649
specifically in two different places on

424
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,209
my first page in the fourth page and I

425
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:11,220
have that document if anybody's

426
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:14,219
interested in seeing it but it's

427
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,620
essentially you know the the cannabis

428
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,259
workers are deemed essential workforce

429
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,269
and the supply chain are deemed

430
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:23,009
essential so we have it pretty clear I

431
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:25,289
would think in the state of California

432
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:27,870
and the problem then gets into local

433
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:30,360
control which has oh then as those of us

434
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,209
on this call probably to test to kind of

435
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,370
a point of contention in California

436
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:37,919
and it's one thing that you know maybe

437
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,110
other states don't experience and maybe

438
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,059
you can avoid creating a problem with

439
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,800
but I'm not sure in this instance you'd

440
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:46,349
be able to avoid it and the locals are

441
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:50,669
coming up with more stringent or like

442
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,139
just different interpretations sure just

443
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:54,299
one one word about sort of the

444
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:56,610
difference between adult used in medical

445
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:58,289
use my understanding is I was lucky

446
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,850
enough to talk to a few regulators this

447
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:03,120
morning from from a couple different

448
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,400
jurisdictions for instance in

449
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,369
Massachusetts Loren exactly what you

450
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,259
said was you know that vast people in

451
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:12,779
certain jurisdictions where both medical

452
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:14,400
and adult use is legal people have

453
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:15,750
forgotten their medical cards because

454
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,220
they have access through the adult use

455
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,369
programs and so in a lot of

456
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,838
jurisdictions you don't have you have

457
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,250
individuals that would have had a

458
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,599
medical card in the past I fall into

459
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,250
this category I used to have a medical

460
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,869
card in California and I simply don't

461
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,339
need it to go to an adult use dispensary

462
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:31,439
and so I haven't bothered to renew it

463
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:35,609
and if it was deemed only a medical

464
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,450
necessity for medical supplies versus

465
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:38,129
the don't you supply

466
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,480
I would be ineligible for that even

467
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,070
though at one point I did have that

468
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,139
medical card and I'm just chosen not to

469
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:44,398
renew it and so certain states seem to

470
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:46,558
have explicitly sort of acknowledged

471
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,638
that and open it up in other places like

472
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,009
Michigan

473
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:51,740
they've explicitly made a delineation

474
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:55,558
there where they said that the medical

475
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,609
the medical dispensaries are essential

476
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:59,250
businesses and the adult use

477
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:00,599
dispensaries are not in Michigan one of

478
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,909
the differences there is that it's a

479
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,528
very nascent adult use market and so not

480
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:06,299
many people have sort of switched out of

481
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:07,798
that medical market into the adult use

482
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:10,048
market and of course we don't like to

483
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:12,690
think of those two markets as fungible

484
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:14,730
but consumer behavior may sort of

485
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:18,630
evident it's a different a different

486
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:20,250
course of action in terms of that

487
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,470
conflict sorry Lauren did you want to

488
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,058
get some you know if we continue to you

489
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,038
know stress that divide also then we're

490
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,509
perpetuating a stigma or boxing

491
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,740
ourselves in between medical and adult

492
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:31,019
using them we're forgetting how this

493
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,130
plant ever became you know classified as

494
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:33,659
a Schedule one substance in the first

495
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,880
instance and it's really you know

496
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:37,500
perfectly safe and you know should be

497
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,909
treated just like other you know safe

498
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,138
substances liquor is an essential

499
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,159
business here in New York I know that

500
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:44,339
much

501
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:46,080
but you know I it's unfortunate that the

502
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:47,879
the reverb that you know that the effect

503
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,710
of this is that it's you know causing us

504
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,769
to make distinctions where I was hoping

505
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,940
some of those distinctions were blurred

506
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:56,130
well we created a system in California

507
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,009
where we had combined this and combined

508
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,778
it all and so he need for the

509
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:03,058
recommendation and so we created this

510
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:04,980
system whereby and we as a you know as a

511
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,960
retailer you can't necessarily ask

512
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,190
someone what their condition is you're

513
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,259
not going to ask for their medical

514
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,880
information you know so there was a

515
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:13,440
moment there was a hot minute in there

516
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,730
where we thought whoa we need to make

517
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,700
sure but he gets a recommendation just

518
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,919
to cover themselves and to cover us for

519
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,288
this transaction thankfully that's not

520
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,970
the current you know game plan or

521
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:26,419
current thinking but it could shift that

522
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:29,278
way and we need to be able to you know

523
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:32,250
educate our clients about the need for

524
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:34,109
public outreach the need for maintaining

525
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,269
contact with your local representatives

526
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:38,548
I mean that's one of the key plays that

527
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:40,769
we've been working for years and years

528
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:42,990
but really reaching out to people with

529
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:44,130
resources so if they really need to get

530
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,048
a recommendation they can get one

531
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,149
quickly because those are in most

532
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:50,308
jurisdictions it seems to be relatively

533
00:19:48,148 --> 00:19:53,199
accessible

534
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:54,490
normal has been part of the the fight

535
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,960
within each local jurisdiction

536
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:59,319
throughout the state and I believe that

537
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,509
they have some great data on you know

538
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:04,000
how many medical cards like have been

539
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:05,769
retired in recent months you know if

540
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,750
anybody needs any help making that

541
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:09,190
argument or substantiating that I know

542
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,710
that they would be happy to help and

543
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,860
they also have resources to connect

544
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:17,620
people with doctors online so if you do

545
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:19,898
if you are stuck in a jurisdiction that

546
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:21,819
ends up policing your use and requiring

547
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:26,018
some kind of ID card there are resources

548
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:29,609
through normal to connect people you

549
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:32,380
know who need to to get that resource

550
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:34,298
sure we we one of the themes that keeps

551
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,789
coming up is sort of liaison with your

552
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:37,720
local jurisdiction and making sure that

553
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:40,359
you have an open line of communication

554
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:43,389
there obviously we ran into something in

555
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:45,428
Berkeley last week Laura could you tell

556
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:47,859
us a little bit about what was going on

557
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:48,970
and Berkeley sort of maybe how that

558
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:52,538
departed from the guidance from the

559
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:54,788
state and sort of what what your course

560
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:59,259
of action might have been if any of

561
00:20:54,788 --> 00:21:00,579
that's true well I mean like we touched

562
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,990
on earlier you know there's this element

563
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:04,269
of local control and we have to

564
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:08,500
understand that the locals have a great

565
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:10,359
deal of power when it comes to their you

566
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:14,950
know the health and safety of their

567
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:17,138
citizens and so you know I we did have

568
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,500
an instance where in the city of

569
00:21:17,138 --> 00:21:21,788
Berkeley they essentially they didn't

570
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,380
try to close everybody down like they

571
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:25,089
did in San Francisco so San Francisco

572
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,769
send us an email like six o'clock at

573
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:28,928
night and said you need a closed period

574
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:31,888
there was no delivery there was no

575
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:34,480
curbside there was there was no option

576
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:38,019
Berkeley pivoted a little bit and said

577
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,058
well you know we don't really like the

578
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:42,339
idea of all of these people congregating

579
00:21:40,058 --> 00:21:45,190
in these small retail facilities that

580
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:48,418
are you know I think in a lot of

581
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:50,679
regulators Minds notoriously grungy and

582
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:53,440
so they said well we had to pivot to

583
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:56,440
delivery only which effectively at that

584
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,538
time would have shuttered all that one

585
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:03,519
of the organizations that was operating

586
00:21:58,538 --> 00:22:05,888
in the city of Berkeley another one was

587
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,630
poised to commence delivery within the

588
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:08,918
next couple of days with the idea that

589
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,130
this was probably coming down the pipe

590
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:15,429
but you know and so it really would have

591
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:18,399
had a significant impact on access to

592
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:20,440
Berkeley residents and an impact on the

593
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:24,398
Berkeley employees and the businesses

594
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,139
located there so we put a a group of you

595
00:22:24,398 --> 00:22:30,339
know retailers together I think Sabina

596
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:32,589
Fenric was super super fundamental in

597
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:35,259
making this group happen she's just an

598
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:37,709
amazing woman with so much energy and so

599
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:39,599
much passion about this access issue

600
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:45,009
she's kind of my idol

601
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:46,740
Sabrina's awesome yeah right and so she

602
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:49,179
put together a group of retailers we all

603
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,159
collaborated or they got on calls daily

604
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:52,929
talked about what we could do what we

605
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:54,879
should do how to unite stand together

606
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:57,070
there's a really kind of inspiring

607
00:22:54,878 --> 00:22:59,798
movement everybody mobilized their

608
00:22:57,069 --> 00:23:01,778
individual resources their lobbyists you

609
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:04,388
know their personal connections and kind

610
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:07,388
of put the pressure back on the powers

611
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:09,548
that be to make the determination that

612
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:12,490
came down a couple of days later which

613
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:15,460
was essentially okay no in-store but

614
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,138
will commit the curbside and if you're

615
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,950
in California you probably know by now

616
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:23,048
that the Bureau has been very rapidly

617
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,659
turning around permission for curbside

618
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:28,388
delivery pursuant to the emergency

619
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:29,860
orders um so it was a it was a huge step

620
00:23:28,388 --> 00:23:35,709
because it really made the difference

621
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:40,178
between laying off 50 people and keeping

622
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:43,210
everybody employed for us yeah that's a

623
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:46,059
that's a huge issue and we've seen other

624
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:48,490
places too that have relaxed some of the

625
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:51,099
licensing guidelines around delivery in

626
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:54,819
order to provide that it doesn't of

627
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:56,408
course make providing delivery that's

628
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:58,178
compliant with the state required

629
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:59,379
regulations of your GPS it doesn't it

630
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:00,940
doesn't make that any cheaper for a

631
00:23:59,378 --> 00:24:02,619
business and so it doesn't necessarily

632
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,679
make it more available especially in a

633
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:08,018
time of existing financial duress so

634
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,320
it's still not good maybe not solve the

635
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:14,888
problem but certainly could try to

636
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:16,929
alleviate it and so are we seeing now in

637
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:18,699
Berkeley its its curbside pickup and

638
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:22,150
livery only right and the dispensary

639
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,039
doors remain closed and so in an effort

640
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,710
to sort of cut down on human to human

641
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:28,569
contact we're not seeing doors open

642
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,789
they're supposed to be you know there

643
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:32,829
were a couple of retailers that decided

644
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:35,049
they were gonna stay open you know they

645
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:37,750
really took a stand for access and hats

646
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:39,579
off to him you know certain other

647
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,630
retailers decided that was too much of a

648
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:46,049
risk to take for their patients

649
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:50,080
permanent access and the existence of

650
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:51,399
their permits you know so everybody it

651
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,579
was able to make their own decisions on

652
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,650
that one but yeah as far as we know I

653
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:58,210
haven't driven by any of the retailers

654
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:03,970
in the last couple of days but they're

655
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:05,079
supposed to have doors closed yeah very

656
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,240
expensive I mean you think about

657
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:09,189
purchasing a couple of vehicles to

658
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,140
perform this delivery and you're talking

659
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:14,620
about $20,000 investment

660
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:17,770
easy per vehicle retraining drivers

661
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:19,149
creating new SOPs um you know the lucky

662
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:21,400
thing is in Berkeley I said in

663
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:23,590
California delivery is actually as a

664
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,509
right essentially with your license if

665
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:27,279
you have a retail facility so we lucked

666
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:31,359
out that way I think you know getting

667
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:33,190
those kinds of mechanisms built into the

668
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,259
ordinances that we seek to pass an

669
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,930
additional jurisdictions is this key

670
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:40,660
right the ability to pivot and to say

671
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:43,150
people can do these things as a right I

672
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,550
think will prove very important as we

673
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:49,570
shift as an economy the way that we do

674
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:54,279
business in general and is that mostly

675
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:56,710
what the other three on this call so Liz

676
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:58,450
Lauren and Lauren is is that mostly what

677
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,000
you're seeing as well in terms of retail

678
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:03,100
facilities have been allowed to do

679
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,240
curbside and delivery but maybe not so

680
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:09,519
much in person business yeah there was a

681
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,769
few places that I'm aware of still do

682
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,480
allow the stores to stay open but that's

683
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:15,789
pretty much they're all changing and

684
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:20,170
tightening the order is to have it just

685
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:21,190
be delivery or pickup so and I think you

686
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:23,259
know I think I put that probably makes

687
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:25,630
sense from just the perspective of

688
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:27,519
limiting human to human contact and not

689
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,900
just human human contact but like human

690
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:32,599
to surface where another human

691
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,700
entered into contact with contact so I

692
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:36,139
think that it just makes sense from that

693
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,789
perspective although you do want to make

694
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,100
sure if you're doing a lot of deliveries

695
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:41,990
your delivery drivers better be not sick

696
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,909
and better be wearing masks and gloves

697
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,549
and that delivery vehicle better be

698
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:48,890
super clean because that they're gonna

699
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:51,399
be in that vehicle with with those

700
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:54,530
products for an extended period of time

701
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:58,009
now we saw the city of San Diego

702
00:26:54,529 --> 00:27:01,339
they issued a clarifying order that

703
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:03,470
curbside wasn't paying and they issued a

704
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:06,379
very strong recommendations they were

705
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:08,299
they were suggesting anything from you

706
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,960
know that all transactions be made on

707
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:13,879
camera and that there be like special

708
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,049
timing mechanisms like only a certain

709
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,700
number of people could actually leave

710
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:19,849
their cars at one time to pick up the

711
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:23,090
delivery and they said in the order like

712
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:24,589
we will be inspecting each business like

713
00:27:23,089 --> 00:27:27,559
essentially like expect like further

714
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:29,869
scrutiny from us so that was a surprise

715
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:31,700
because San Diego you know had kind of

716
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:32,899
held out for a long time and you know

717
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,970
they're quite conservatives who were

718
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,830
glad but you know it was also something

719
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,150
of a call to action like okay they are

720
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:40,129
going to be watching they are going to

721
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:42,110
be checking and like we need to take

722
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,330
this very seriously but also not give

723
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:45,769
them any reason to think that you know

724
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,629
our clients are anything but in strict

725
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:50,869
compliance with these recommendations

726
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:53,090
and rules and in terms of that guidance

727
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,979
from San Diego did that a lot of what

728
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:57,379
we're seeing is that for instance Laura

729
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,910
and I were talking earlier a lot of

730
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,890
those restrictions come down from the

731
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:02,390
Department of Health was that coming

732
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,770
from the Department of Health or was

733
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,590
that coming from sort of a Bureau of

734
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:08,569
cannabis control and were those

735
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:10,819
requirements things were placed on other

736
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:12,559
sort of similarly situated businesses or

737
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:14,689
where cannabis businesses sort of being

738
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,569
singled out for additional scrutiny

739
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:19,370
under some of these policies so for the

740
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:21,889
curbside rules I just mentioned it was

741
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:23,869
cannabis specific so I don't remember

742
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:25,820
who exactly issued it I think it was San

743
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:28,309
Diego's like cannabis specific Authority

744
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:32,779
I do know that you know this was for

745
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:35,750
dispensaries definitely and Lauren you

746
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:37,369
had mentioned some some of the some of

747
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,720
the practices that people can take for

748
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:40,339
instance in delivery you know wearing

749
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,769
gloves and masks and making sure that

750
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:43,599
you're not sick you know we've also seen

751
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:44,589
this

752
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,019
critical this essential business

753
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:48,579
designation be placed on supply chains I

754
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:51,400
know that you do a lot of work with

755
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:53,379
armors up in Northern California sort of

756
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,509
are you seeing anything that we should

757
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,580
take away from that sort of specialized

758
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:59,079
supply chain issues or are there best

759
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:01,389
practices that you're seeing you know

760
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:04,418
obviously if you're cultivating you

761
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,740
can't do that remotely so what are you

762
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:07,809
seeing any sort of specialized issues up

763
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,730
there right so yeah I work with a lot of

764
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:11,410
cultivators manufacturers super adorns

765
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,910
the whole bit and basically the whole

766
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,679
supply chain has been deemed essential

767
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:17,440
by the state of California at this point

768
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:20,590
which is great and certain counties have

769
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,210
even called out cannabis farming like

770
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:23,769
Mendocino County calls it out in their

771
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:27,190
agriculture section of essential

772
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:28,990
businesses and you know so there's no I

773
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,750
don't think there's any question at this

774
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,669
point in California whether or not the

775
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:35,259
you know just retail is essentially the

776
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:36,370
whole supply chain is it's understood

777
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:38,440
it's it's the whole supply chain

778
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:41,168
otherwise there will be no essential

779
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,298
product at the end but there are still

780
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:45,669
obviously if you have a worker anywhere

781
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:48,099
in the supply chain that is continuing

782
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:50,470
to go to work they do have to follow

783
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:53,798
there's CDC guidance there's OSHA

784
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:56,230
guidance CD pH has put out some guidance

785
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:58,029
for you know basically if you're in a

786
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,460
manufacturing facility just follow good

787
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:02,379
manufacturing practices in addition to

788
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,079
everything that the CDC and OSHA are

789
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,059
telling you to do such as wearing masks

790
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:08,408
proper sanitization proper hygiene if

791
00:30:07,058 --> 00:30:10,298
staying home if you're sick a lot of

792
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:12,309
this is just basic stuff

793
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:14,798
that honestly businesses should be doing

794
00:30:12,308 --> 00:30:17,589
anyway with maybe the exception of you

795
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,759
know unnecessary layers of PPE but in

796
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:20,980
certain types of facilities like a

797
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,929
manufacturing facility your employees

798
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,240
should really always be having gloves

799
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:28,059
and proper PPE of all sorts on just to

800
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,769
prevent contamination of any sort and

801
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:32,740
you know just to prevent if they're sick

802
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:34,779
with something else so I do think that a

803
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,130
lot of businesses are you know it

804
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:38,079
impacts the whole supply chain basically

805
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,700
I'm not just cannabis I mean every type

806
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,490
of business no matter where you are now

807
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,259
needs to really take a look at your

808
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,269
day-to-day practices and make sure that

809
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:49,690
you're following OSHA and is following

810
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:51,490
the CDC guidance and keeping yourself

811
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,990
and your employees and your community

812
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,000
safe

813
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,558
keeping people apart if you need to have

814
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,470
people in the same room having them be

815
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:02,589
far apart there's you know just ways

816
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:04,569
that you can keep people more distance

817
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:05,829
encouraging working remotely for a lot

818
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:08,139
of these businesses a lot of their staff

819
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:10,329
can be working remotely so if that's

820
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:12,070
possible then have them do it if they

821
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:14,019
can't like they're on the farm or in the

822
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:15,879
production facility then just you know

823
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:17,889
you have to take those other measures

824
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,230
into account but there is a lot of

825
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,900
guidance that's in put out there by

826
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:25,870
state governments federal governments

827
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:28,630
about how businesses of this sort should

828
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:32,019
continue to operate in a safe manner if

829
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,850
they're gonna do so so you know I we can

830
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:36,879
maybe send some of those links out to

831
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:39,099
folks afterwards but I just encourage

832
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,510
everyone to take a look at those and and

833
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:44,740
really take that into account if you're

834
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:46,329
going to be operating so sure ya did let

835
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,640
people back in I mean the stores doors

836
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:50,529
are open in the City and County of San

837
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,780
Francisco right now I mean essentially

838
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:54,519
the rule is if you have two

839
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:56,440
point-of-sale systems you can have two

840
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,150
people in your shop at that time if you

841
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,440
have five POS systems you can have five

842
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,630
people in your shop everybody else needs

843
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,340
to be queued up outside standing on a

844
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,840
piece of tape six feet apart you know

845
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:06,789
it's pretty explicit there they're

846
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:09,639
pretty clear and what they want from you

847
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:12,039
but there there are person-to-person

848
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,280
patient consults continuing to happen

849
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:17,230
and there's a lot of really interesting

850
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:18,759
tech based patient and patient stuff

851
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,380
that's being talked about behind the

852
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:22,900
scenes in a lot of places so I think

853
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:26,380
we're gonna see hopefully a little bit

854
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,100
of Grossman in those areas as well I was

855
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,120
gonna say that was one of the

856
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:30,849
interesting things that we saw in

857
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:34,418
Michigan I believe it was in Michigan

858
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:37,269
that they fast-tracked tella tella

859
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,990
appointments for doctors in order to be

860
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:40,058
able to get those medical

861
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,279
recommendations because they did

862
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:44,109
restrict access to medical only and so

863
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:45,609
they did find ways to sort of expedite

864
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:48,308
those process using some technology

865
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:49,899
solutions sorry go ahead Lauren I was

866
00:32:48,308 --> 00:32:51,579
gonna say I think that this is you know

867
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,990
the industry as a whole is going to and

868
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:54,579
not just the cannabis industry but every

869
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:56,950
industry as a whole is going to have to

870
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:59,470
shift a bit right how we operate I think

871
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:01,450
that things are gonna be more virtual

872
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:04,029
more online working from home might be

873
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,789
more of a common thing social distancing

874
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:06,319
might

875
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:09,170
be something we have to do for an

876
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:12,109
extended member of months who knows but

877
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:14,210
I think this is an opportunity for us to

878
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:16,250
utilize technology and everything that

879
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,410
we have available to us now that you

880
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,970
haven't had during past you know global

881
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,250
pandemics to deal with stuff like this

882
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,710
and we can still be effective and work

883
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,660
and get things done I think it's

884
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,850
important that we keep in perspective

885
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,920
what's happening around us though right

886
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:33,169
like people are dying and so for us to

887
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:37,360
just keep going on like business as

888
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:40,130
usual we have to you know we have to be

889
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,929
just you know pay attention to what's

890
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,460
happening around us right and people are

891
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,750
hurting right now people have lost their

892
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,850
jobs and it's wonderful that our

893
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:49,190
industry can keep keep operating right

894
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:51,019
now but but who knows right like

895
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,600
anything anything could happen and so

896
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:55,509
it's important that we are prepared for

897
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,189
the worst but hope for the best

898
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:59,629
yeah absolutely

899
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,610
Liz are you are you seeing anything

900
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:04,100
different down in Southern California or

901
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:06,319
is it sort of along those same lines of

902
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:08,360
you know queuing outside of dispensaries

903
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:10,219
and sort of are there are there best

904
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,720
practices that are sort of just falling

905
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:15,168
in line with with the rest of what we've

906
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:16,579
heard today I mean I think that a lot of

907
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:19,009
the practices that we discussed on the

908
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:23,059
collar being taken into account you know

909
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:25,220
lots of curbside pickup I can't think of

910
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:27,529
anything that is unique to LA or a

911
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:29,750
particularly restrictive effort for LA

912
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:30,950
we were pretty successful in that up

913
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:34,059
front lobbying with the governor's

914
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:36,829
office in the city I to allow you know

915
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:41,409
broad freedoms and rules so we haven't

916
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:43,340
had any type of like micromanagement of

917
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:44,929
processes but people have been

918
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:48,260
innovative and I think respectful of

919
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:52,760
good social distancing rules United's

920
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:54,889
sure can we just shift a little bit now

921
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,929
and sort of move back to the state level

922
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:59,360
I know that you know we have this

923
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:01,269
appellation symposium that is coming up

924
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,110
on Thursday that we're doing online now

925
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:05,329
one of the reasons that we've pushed

926
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:07,780
forward with that is because those

927
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:10,819
regulations were dropped by the CDFA

928
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,140
that deadline for comment periods has

929
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,820
not been pushed back and so we're still

930
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:16,609
looking at I think it's an April 14th

931
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,099
comment deadline are we seeing at the

932
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:20,200
state level either in

933
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:21,778
learn in New York anywhere else on the

934
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:24,608
East Coast are we seeing any sort of

935
00:35:21,778 --> 00:35:26,228
deadlines being pushed back we know that

936
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:28,748
there's been some requests for relief

937
00:35:26,228 --> 00:35:30,460
from the state of California in terms of

938
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:33,038
licensing fees in terms of licensing

939
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:35,710
renewals are we seeing people getting

940
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:38,410
any relief from those anywhere I'm not

941
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:40,539
seeing a relief on the fees what I am

942
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:41,978
seeing though is relief on some of the

943
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:44,140
more onerous requirements and getting

944
00:35:41,978 --> 00:35:45,848
the application and you know for example

945
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:47,949
in person finger printing requirements

946
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:50,229
notary requirements things like that are

947
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:52,210
being waived temporarily by the CCC in

948
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:53,679
Massachusetts I don't really have too

949
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:55,239
much direct experience with other states

950
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:56,649
at this point of time and dealing with

951
00:35:55,239 --> 00:36:00,068
like a provisional license that's headed

952
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:01,210
on to a final license but I know with

953
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:02,798
respect to submissions they're being

954
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,619
very gracious in terms of what you can

955
00:36:02,798 --> 00:36:07,719
submit you know submit what you can and

956
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:11,920
you know continue to move forward

957
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:15,548
towards getting a license have we heard

958
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,190
anything in California I'm seeing it's a

959
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:21,429
lot the same man yet we haven't we

960
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:23,559
haven't obtained consent yet like for an

961
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,478
express delay but I think that you know

962
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:27,789
if you're talking with your license

963
00:36:25,478 --> 00:36:29,759
analysts there is an understanding that

964
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:42,609
things are difficult to get right now

965
00:36:29,759 --> 00:36:45,789
where there is work going on yeah I was

966
00:36:42,608 --> 00:36:48,159
watching and yeah so you know it's there

967
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:49,839
it is in the works in California it's

968
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,478
definitely you're not not secured which

969
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:54,900
is really aggravating because seeing

970
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:58,439
governor governor newsome's

971
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:01,660
latest issue order issued last night

972
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,900
essentially giving the ABC Express

973
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:06,940
rights to delay licensing fees and delay

974
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,700
licensing renewal or obligations and

975
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:12,009
ignoring the Bureau of cannabis control

976
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:14,199
I was frustrated and I'm sure he's got

977
00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:16,170
plenty of good reasons for that but you

978
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:18,879
know I think it gives us this additional

979
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:21,670
fodder to argue that we should be

980
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,969
treated the same there was a letter that

981
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:26,909
went out I believe yesterday Clark

982
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:30,068
Howell signed it along with I think a

983
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:31,750
hundred other members of the legal

984
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:34,929
cannabis community and it was

985
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:37,989
asking the governor to delay licensing

986
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:40,289
for use by at least 90 days provide a

987
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:43,209
50% reduction for the rest of the year

988
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:45,070
for businesses that can demonstrate that

989
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:47,650
they need that reduction in order to

990
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:50,289
retain their employees and then to

991
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,389
provide relief from penalties for you

992
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:54,820
know BCC licensee use that do not

993
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:56,710
correctly estimate you know their

994
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:59,380
revenue for the next year's I know that

995
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:01,869
that was a really strong you know

996
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:05,619
missive to the governor's office and I

997
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:07,960
hope that there are others you know with

998
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:10,029
similar letters in the works but I think

999
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,710
we also need to be thoughtful about you

1000
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:13,180
know what other kind of relief that we

1001
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:16,630
push for because I assume it's gonna be

1002
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:18,309
is such a tight legislative season so I

1003
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,920
know that Clark Howell has been vocal in

1004
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:24,460
our support of a be 1948 which would

1005
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:27,130
reduce the excise tax to 11% and would

1006
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:30,400
eliminate the cultivation tax both until

1007
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:33,150
odd July 2023 so those were two things

1008
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,099
that we thought you know would be a good

1009
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:38,369
you know good initiatives to really push

1010
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:43,269
and just to be as specific as possible

1011
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:44,650
absolutely you know one of the other

1012
00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:47,289
things that we've seen in response to

1013
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:51,460
this crisis is the federal government

1014
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:53,739
jumping in to bail out certain sectors

1015
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:56,860
of course there are supposed to be

1016
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:58,859
certain measures of oversight on that we

1017
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,420
don't know if that's gonna happen or not

1018
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:03,099
what is the availability to cannabis

1019
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,260
businesses for any of this sort of

1020
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:08,199
relief is there any availability at all

1021
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:11,170
and one step further than that what is

1022
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:13,449
the availability for a relief for maybe

1023
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,309
ancillary services things like law firms

1024
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:18,429
that could potentially be suffering in

1025
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:19,900
this time yeah well I think that I'm

1026
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:21,669
happy to jump in here if anyone else

1027
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,139
wants to but I think that you know the

1028
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,860
loan package has come in in basically

1029
00:39:23,139 --> 00:39:26,170
two forms

1030
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:28,480
there's the SBA the small business loans

1031
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:30,190
and then there's the carers Act and I

1032
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,440
believe that there is a restriction on

1033
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,630
the small business loans for the

1034
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,190
prohibits any illegal activity and

1035
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,630
illegal activity isn't just plant

1036
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,250
touching businesses their definition

1037
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:41,349
includes direct or indirect so it would

1038
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,179
include ancillary businesses as well but

1039
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:45,650
under the cares after there is no

1040
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:47,118
similar restriction for illegal activity

1041
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,010
ever because those loans are run through

1042
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,180
traditional financial institutions it's

1043
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,650
gonna be just as difficult for a

1044
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,269
cannabis business have access to that

1045
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,190
funding as it would be for them to have

1046
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:57,170
an ordinary banking you know ordinary

1047
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,789
banking services so you know again I

1048
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,778
think it depends on your relationship

1049
00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:00,770
with your banker if you've got a good

1050
00:39:59,778 --> 00:40:03,260
one you know then this might be a

1051
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:05,659
program they could be interested in but

1052
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,250
you know we're definitely taking a look

1053
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:08,929
at this for our clients and you know

1054
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:10,608
processing applications where we can or

1055
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:12,078
submitting them definitely encouraging

1056
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:14,179
them to get the you know the information

1057
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,099
together you know so that when the

1058
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:17,929
regulations officially come out which i

1059
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:19,519
think is April 3rd you know people will

1060
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:20,598
be ready and organized that the

1061
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:25,309
information they need to be able to

1062
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:26,568
submit sure are there any other sort of

1063
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:27,740
issues that people are seeing from the

1064
00:40:26,568 --> 00:40:29,778
federal government coming down that

1065
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:31,129
might impact our are sort of localized

1066
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,750
businesses whether their client

1067
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:35,778
businesses or other legal industry

1068
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:37,429
businesses I'm not on the federal level

1069
00:40:35,778 --> 00:40:38,929
but on the state level if anyone has any

1070
00:40:37,429 --> 00:40:40,399
clients you know that are manufacturing

1071
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:42,558
and he's sort of protective equipment

1072
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,119
you know on a call from New York hear

1073
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:45,410
from the husband and I would ask that

1074
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:47,000
you you know see if your clients are

1075
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:48,769
capable of manufacturing this stuff and

1076
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
sending it over to New York and sending

1077
00:40:48,769 --> 00:40:52,250
over health care professionals and

1078
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,329
anyone that you have they the state of

1079
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,429
New York has made very clear that they

1080
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:58,220
will pay a premium you know for a

1081
00:40:55,429 --> 00:40:59,149
personnel for people for equipment you

1082
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:00,858
know so if you've got the type of

1083
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,329
business that some have businesses had

1084
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:04,429
reached out with their ability to make

1085
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:05,599
masks or whatever it could be but

1086
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:07,009
there's definitely opportunity from

1087
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,250
state governments to get funding for

1088
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:13,010
manufacturing yeah I just want to jump

1089
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:15,139
in real quick and say that in terms of

1090
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:17,778
federal Reese you know resources that

1091
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,848
are available hemp hemp business would

1092
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:22,219
be eligible right because because the

1093
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:23,690
farm bill is passed that's legal so I'm

1094
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:25,489
sure that we have some folks in the call

1095
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,048
that might feed you know pump operators

1096
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:29,118
they can take advantage those resources

1097
00:41:27,048 --> 00:41:31,250
and then in terms of just making masks

1098
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,588
and PPE and everything absolutely where

1099
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:36,019
we've seen some examples here in

1100
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:37,759
California of different types of

1101
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:39,528
cannabis manufacturers and other

1102
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,599
operators that have made hand sanitizer

1103
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:43,818
and other types of products and it's

1104
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,250
really it's a really wonderful way to

1105
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:48,949
step up and to show everyone that our

1106
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:51,650
industry cares and to use use your

1107
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:53,000
facility and your everything really good

1108
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:56,298
cause right now and it's good publicity

1109
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,219
for your business as well so I do

1110
00:41:56,298 --> 00:42:00,139
encourage folks to do that

1111
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:01,309
they can yep now this a really good

1112
00:42:00,139 --> 00:42:02,659
point on hemp businesses they would have

1113
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:06,949
access to both the small business and

1114
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:08,629
the cares act are those SBA loans that

1115
00:42:06,949 --> 00:42:11,779
are given to agriculture the

1116
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:13,369
agricultural industry are those issued

1117
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:17,330
through the USDA loans are those the

1118
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:18,339
same ones you know that very tried don't

1119
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:21,529
believe that

1120
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:24,079
okay I think if someone maybe oh we

1121
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:26,330
could go talking about USDA support and

1122
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,759
sort of issues much some of the small

1123
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:31,759
farmers a small loan program through

1124
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:34,610
them but that was unaware of it before

1125
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,220
now I did want to get to one other

1126
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:39,920
aspect Loren Riddick really wanted to

1127
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:43,069
talk about the force majeure clauses in

1128
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,500
sort of how sort of preparation for the

1129
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:47,809
cannabis industry could could help us in

1130
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,550
some regard also sort of as a

1131
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:51,259
prophylactic going forward obviously we

1132
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:53,480
want to take a look at those clauses so

1133
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,770
Lori could you did you just give us a

1134
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,619
little bit of knowledge around that well

1135
00:42:54,769 --> 00:42:58,880
we should be yeah I think I've heard the

1136
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:00,409
word force majeure more times in the

1137
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,990
past three weeks and I have my entire

1138
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:04,460
legal career but you know these

1139
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:05,959
provisions are you know frequently

1140
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,250
looked at as boilerplate completely

1141
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,230
under negotiated but they can be a very

1142
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,460
effective tool to preserving you know

1143
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,070
your supply chain the integrity of your

1144
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,480
supply chain and it's very important to

1145
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:17,269
know that in the absence of a force

1146
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,519
majeure provision the law will imply

1147
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:20,840
some pretty intense presumptions they

1148
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:22,909
will presume that certain events were

1149
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,250
foreseeable they will presume that the

1150
00:43:22,909 --> 00:43:26,929
non-parent non-paying party to Cle the

1151
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,360
supplier might be the only one relieved

1152
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:31,429
from performance so it's very important

1153
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,110
that if you have a force majeure

1154
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:34,489
provision that you think through you

1155
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,990
know first of all is it mutual or

1156
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:37,250
unilateral does it excuse one or both

1157
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:38,899
parties for performance and does

1158
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,489
performance include payment you notice

1159
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,260
the ability to pay or not pay does that

1160
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:44,509
constitute a force majeure event if it's

1161
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,530
related to a force majeure event and

1162
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:47,000
then you have to think about you know

1163
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:48,860
the whole including but not limited to

1164
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,059
language you know some courts will say

1165
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,289
if the event is listed it was

1166
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:53,299
foreseeable and I think that wasn't

1167
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:54,380
listed it wasn't foreseeable and so you

1168
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,120
have to make sure that if you have a

1169
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,550
finite list or an open list and you know

1170
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:00,079
be careful on that language you know and

1171
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:01,760
one instance you might want to keep the

1172
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,989
definition very broad and open and in

1173
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,550
the other instance depending on what

1174
00:44:02,989 --> 00:44:06,169
side of the distribution chain you're on

1175
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,330
you know you might want it to be very

1176
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,710
restrictive you know force majeure

1177
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:11,539
provisions have a variety of other

1178
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,720
negotiable aspects to them you know for

1179
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:13,159
in

1180
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:14,868
since there's notice provisions you know

1181
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:16,190
in the event of a force majeure one

1182
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:17,660
party might be required to give the

1183
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:19,369
other party notice of non-performance

1184
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:20,899
and that notice might have to come

1185
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:22,010
within a reasonable time or promptly or

1186
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,900
immediately or within commercial

1187
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,220
reasonableness or best efforts or

1188
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,289
whatever sort of qualifier that you've

1189
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:29,299
included to provide notice but that's

1190
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:31,279
another English version you want to make

1191
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,390
sure that if there's some sort of

1192
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,460
disruption in performance that

1193
00:44:32,389 --> 00:44:36,079
appropriate notice is given and

1194
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,190
sometimes that notice not only has to be

1195
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,690
given within a certain amount of time

1196
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:40,700
but it has to identify steps being taken

1197
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:42,470
to mitigate the impact of the force

1198
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:44,210
majeure provision so that's something

1199
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:45,949
you can also require your you know

1200
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:47,630
supplier or your distributor to do is

1201
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,980
actually have them set forth what's

1202
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:50,840
happening and what they're planning to

1203
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,219
do to correct it and then of course

1204
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,559
you've got the number of time within

1205
00:44:52,219 --> 00:44:56,598
which you you can escape you know with

1206
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,009
or without liability you know so it's

1207
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:00,710
important to include that amount of time

1208
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:02,750
if a force majeure event lasts for 30

1209
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:04,010
days 60 days 90 days you know at what

1210
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:06,380
point can the parties start to look

1211
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:07,790
elsewhere for supply particularly if

1212
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:10,400
it's an exclusive supplier arrangement

1213
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:12,409
you know at what point you know do the

1214
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,849
parties move on or do they try to keep

1215
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:16,250
it you know do they have a basis to be

1216
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:17,930
able to withstand and then resume as

1217
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,849
soon as the force majeure event ends

1218
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:21,289
these are all negotiable points that

1219
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:23,420
really need to be thought about before

1220
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:24,920
you enter into any contract and the

1221
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,900
truth is you know even though Kovan 19

1222
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,430
it was you know not really foreseeable

1223
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,930
and not very predictable in the cannabis

1224
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:31,098
industry there are a variety of force

1225
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:32,480
majeure events that could happen that

1226
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:34,430
are definitely predictable and

1227
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,960
foreseeable and that includes regulatory

1228
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:37,848
shifts you know particularly on the hem

1229
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,260
front or in cannabis when an entire

1230
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:41,088
product line could all of a sudden be

1231
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,400
you know illegal as we saw with the vape

1232
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:45,230
and you know so there's definitely these

1233
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,940
provisions should be familiar already

1234
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:48,260
and they most definitely should not be

1235
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,088
overlooked and now that we've had this

1236
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,280
major disruption you know I think

1237
00:45:50,088 --> 00:45:53,299
everyone is in everyone's best interest

1238
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,769
to sort of dust off those provisions

1239
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,630
look through them you know see who's

1240
00:45:54,769 --> 00:45:58,400
protected and make sure from a

1241
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:00,950
preventative care basis going forward

1242
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,660
that you take the time to think through

1243
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:05,108
anything that could potentially happen

1244
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:07,250
to disrupt your your-your-your contract

1245
00:46:05,108 --> 00:46:09,440
one of the discussions that I've heard

1246
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,579
coming out of this this discussion of

1247
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,039
these clauses that you're right we've

1248
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:14,598
heard so little about through most of

1249
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:17,358
our legal careers and then of course

1250
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:19,160
something like this happens and all of a

1251
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:22,838
sudden they're highlighted is the idea

1252
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:25,519
of impossibility versus impracticability

1253
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:27,380
and how those two things

1254
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,300
are defined could you give us just a

1255
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,280
little bit of background about sort of

1256
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,019
the difference between those two and and

1257
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,180
how those are interpreted by most courts

1258
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:37,340
my impression is that most courts will

1259
00:46:35,179 --> 00:46:39,109
deem it a force majeure event if it's if

1260
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:41,900
performance is impossible but not if

1261
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:45,500
it's economically impracticable which is

1262
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,369
a fairly high bar yep I think you know

1263
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,809
it's been a long time since I've

1264
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:49,759
litigated a you know sort of an

1265
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:52,219
inspiratory breach or you know that sort

1266
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,210
of thing but I you know I think you got

1267
00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:54,469
to look to the contract what the

1268
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,360
contract says you know you've got to

1269
00:46:54,469 --> 00:46:57,679
look to see what you know but the law of

1270
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,019
your state these are definitely cased by

1271
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:03,289
your state by state laws and

1272
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:05,619
presumptions and looking into it but you

1273
00:47:03,289 --> 00:47:07,460
know and we're definitely seeing

1274
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:11,089
disputes with respect to all of those

1275
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:12,920
issues yeah you know an impossibility

1276
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:14,720
and practablity those are a defense you

1277
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,039
know to breach so that only happens once

1278
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:17,509
you've actually breached the force

1279
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:19,519
majeure provision gives you a mechanism

1280
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:21,560
to sort of avoid the BRIT the breach and

1281
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:27,730
work through a potential problem when it

1282
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:30,380
arises over here completing legal issues

1283
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:32,719
we've had a few questions that have have

1284
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:35,240
come in and so this one's from Tammy

1285
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,769
wall and she's wondering is there any

1286
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:39,889
upside to the industry not receiving

1287
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:41,900
federal funds and and basically your

1288
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:43,849
point is if grants or loans are being

1289
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,250
made available on the state level but

1290
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:47,869
not at the federal level and were being

1291
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:49,429
declared essential at the state level

1292
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:50,750
not at the federal level does that put

1293
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:52,609
any sort of pressure on the federal

1294
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,769
government maybe move legislation

1295
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:57,849
forward where maybe that pressure hasn't

1296
00:47:54,769 --> 00:48:00,710
existed in the past or another context

1297
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:03,769
it's pressure on the federal government

1298
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:06,110
it my hot take on that is I don't really

1299
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:07,489
see them paying much more attention to

1300
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,720
cannabis issues considering everything

1301
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:10,759
that's going on at the federal level

1302
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,949
right now but I do think it'll put more

1303
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:15,050
pressure at the state level for the

1304
00:48:12,949 --> 00:48:19,460
governor's office to lend a helping hand

1305
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:21,050
and you know right now it's really you

1306
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,780
know a lot of the sanitization measures

1307
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:28,039
are dependent on cannabis businesses

1308
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:29,750
having access to you know Clorox wipes

1309
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:30,800
hand sanitizers and your different

1310
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:33,559
things that allow them to actually

1311
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,080
comply with the laws the licensing fees

1312
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:38,299
are very high and we've been lobbying to

1313
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,319
get those you know some relief there so

1314
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,810
maybe the fact that

1315
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:44,900
cannabis doesn't have access to this

1316
00:48:41,809 --> 00:48:47,900
federal relief well you know spur the

1317
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:49,880
state to act yeah you know we have some

1318
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,230
constitutional constraints in the state

1319
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,690
of California right with regard to

1320
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:57,110
expenditures and requiring a legislative

1321
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:59,389
authority and approval for that so we're

1322
00:48:57,110 --> 00:49:01,640
you know at Sacramento people are kind

1323
00:48:59,389 --> 00:49:03,079
of running through the exercise it's

1324
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:05,719
trying to see what they can do it's not

1325
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:09,019
lost on them that this is definitely a

1326
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:12,559
hole in the system that needs to be

1327
00:49:09,019 --> 00:49:14,090
addressed and they're trying to look at

1328
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,710
it from different perspectives but there

1329
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:17,750
are some limitations and there's a big

1330
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:20,570
constitutional debate going on right now

1331
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:23,300
in our state and it's probably like wise

1332
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:24,980
in other jurisdictions as well so I

1333
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,420
think that they are trying to address

1334
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:28,039
the holes but they if they apply the

1335
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,289
federal funding they receive to the

1336
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:33,409
cannabis businesses and they definitely

1337
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:39,079
a risk losing a lot of it if not all of

1338
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:40,940
it is is there any sort of do you think

1339
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:42,679
that a solution for that could be

1340
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:45,710
involved and this is a question it's

1341
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:47,210
sort of from from Andy Andrea Steele do

1342
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,679
you think that any sort of solution

1343
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:51,139
could be inserted into the next stimulus

1344
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:53,539
bill you know we're they're already

1345
00:49:51,139 --> 00:49:55,009
planning a poor stimulus bill they're

1346
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:56,599
already looking at how that's going to

1347
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:58,760
be doled out do you think there's any

1348
00:49:56,599 --> 00:50:00,559
sort of room there to make room for

1349
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,720
these essential cannabis businesses

1350
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,820
given that they've been recognized as

1351
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:07,939
essential by the states or this sort of

1352
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:12,590
a an uphill battle at the federal level

1353
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:14,900
in this context I mean it's tough to

1354
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:16,430
predict like with this whole situation

1355
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:19,099
right what the priorities are going to

1356
00:50:16,429 --> 00:50:22,159
be as as the pandemic continues I think

1357
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:24,230
that overall seeing how many different

1358
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,089
states and not just states the different

1359
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:27,170
countries around the world and different

1360
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:29,450
cities and difficulties have deemed

1361
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:31,579
cannabis to be among their essential

1362
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:34,219
businesses I do think that has can give

1363
00:50:31,579 --> 00:50:37,519
momentum towards overall like federal

1364
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:39,829
legalization and I you know I don't

1365
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,719
write legislation not too involved in

1366
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:44,630
the federal lobbying side of things

1367
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:47,149
there but I bet they're gonna try to put

1368
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:48,860
something in the next stimulus bill I

1369
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:51,050
think they try to put can't they try to

1370
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,260
put cannabis in the coronavirus bill and

1371
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:54,930
it got cut out at the last

1372
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:57,980
I believe so they are they're gonna keep

1373
00:50:54,929 --> 00:51:00,059
trying and it's important for us to keep

1374
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:02,460
supporting the groups that do the

1375
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:05,159
federal lobbying for cannabis

1376
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,960
legalization nationwide because that's

1377
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:08,369
important that we don't you know stop

1378
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,900
fighting for that even though some of us

1379
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:13,250
might be in states that have already

1380
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:16,260
legalized to bury a sixth sense

1381
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:19,289
I'm sorry Austin New York would like to

1382
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,910
buy your California growing cannabis we

1383
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:22,110
would love to ship some of the excess to

1384
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:24,259
other states that need it right

1385
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:31,200
interstate transports got to be a thing

1386
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:33,720
but not yet okay well I know that we've

1387
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,189
been on for about 55 minutes we don't

1388
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:37,889
have any other questions from from the

1389
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:39,780
audience do you guys have any sort of

1390
00:51:37,889 --> 00:51:42,089
clothing closing thoughts that you'd

1391
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:43,620
like to give just before we sign off I

1392
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:45,150
know it's been a long day for for most

1393
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:49,109
of us here especially for you on the

1394
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:50,309
East Coast so anybody want to add I just

1395
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:51,930
want to say it's really good to see your

1396
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:53,429
faces and thank everyone for joining us

1397
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:54,839
and this time I know there's competing

1398
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:55,919
space for webinars and all this stuff

1399
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,420
and this isn't really engaging

1400
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,030
conversation I learned so much from all

1401
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:05,789
of you so thank you for your time and

1402
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:07,769
stay safe healthy yeah I don't mind

1403
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,329
thank you also putting this together on

1404
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:13,019
such short notice and it was great that

1405
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:14,340
so many folks can participate it is an

1406
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:15,630
important time you're going to be

1407
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,720
diligent and we got to be responsible

1408
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:20,550
right now it's a turning point for not

1409
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:23,849
just our industry but for like humanity

1410
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:26,430
right now so it's important that we do

1411
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:28,469
everything with intention and with an hi

1412
00:52:26,429 --> 00:52:31,500
and our mind towards safety of ourselves

1413
00:52:28,469 --> 00:52:36,239
our employees our clients and our

1414
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:37,920
community yeah but also amazing that

1415
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,449
we've you know really made such strides

1416
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,430
that we're now considered an essential

1417
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:45,029
so that's that's I think the silver

1418
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:48,349
lining in all of this yeah absolutely

1419
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:51,000
that's taken a long time to get here so

1420
00:52:48,349 --> 00:52:52,559
make it through this are gonna do great

1421
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,360
you know some businesses will survive

1422
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,489
and some will not but this is you know a

1423
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,900
health crisis not an economic crisis and

1424
00:52:56,489 --> 00:52:59,479
the economics will pick up when the

1425
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:02,480
health crisis is over

1426
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,480
absolutely

1427
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:17,890
okay thank you all soon person we're

1428
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:23,050
raising those we're raising those we're

1429
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:24,759
trying to get those back together I know

1430
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:27,130
I look forward to meeting all in person

1431
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:30,430
and thank you so much to Christ like

1432
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:32,170
this was really like heartening to me to

1433
00:53:30,429 --> 00:53:34,629
speak with all of you I also learned so

1434
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:36,309
much and I think Chrissy said this might

1435
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:40,510
be like a regular thing so I'm also

1436
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:42,608
looking forward to hearing you know

1437
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:44,140
we've had a lot of comments from people

1438
00:53:42,608 --> 00:53:46,299
they just want to stay more connected

1439
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:48,309
with their communities you know we have

1440
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:50,769
a really great community of a bunch of

1441
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:52,449
really really bright people here and I

1442
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,670
love getting to talk to all of them

1443
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:55,809
about different things so we're trying

1444
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:57,519
to make some of those conversations a

1445
00:53:55,809 --> 00:53:59,739
little bit more public so when I get to

1446
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:01,509
you know do my background research with

1447
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:03,399
you guys other people get here some of

1448
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:04,930
it so we have a community of trained

1449
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,780
activists from all across the country

1450
00:54:04,929 --> 00:54:10,389
and I'd be curious to hear from people

1451
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:12,040
who are listening online in other

1452
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:13,509
jurisdictions outside of California New

1453
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:15,340
York you know in places that we maybe

1454
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:16,420
couldn't pay enough attention to on this

1455
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,950
car like what they want to hear from

1456
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,389
what your sections they want to hear

1457
00:54:17,949 --> 00:54:21,358
about and I think we should continue to

1458
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:24,009
have these conversations and invite them

1459
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:24,730
down to the table I think we could do a

1460
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,369
lot of good together

1461
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:28,630
yeah absolutely and if you're interested

1462
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:31,300
in doing one of these in the future

1463
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:33,220
let me know we're always looking for

1464
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:36,100
four great smart interesting people to

1465
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:38,559
talk to so we love all of you stay safe

1466
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:40,559
stay healthy I hope to see you in person

1467
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:43,179
soon until then we'll be back online

1468
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,190
starting again on Thursday we'll do four

1469
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:46,690
hours of Appalachians which is it's

1470
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:48,760
going to be an incredible event it's

1471
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:51,010
really great lineup and so I am I'm

1472
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,450
really glad that the one saving grace of

1473
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:56,670
having to do it online is we get to show

1474
00:54:52,449 --> 00:54:56,669
more people so see all there
