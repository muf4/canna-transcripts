1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,139
[Music]

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,559
what I'm hearing it sounds like too is

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,678
that maybe there's it's probably a lot

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:18,600
more complex than this but three General

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:21,600
Uses or purposes for your te's one would

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,760
be to break down what is already there

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,400
creating nutrition for the plant uh two

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,560
would be to grow the plant and produce

9
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:32,118
some type of growth hormone there and

10
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:36,039
three would be some type of resistance

11
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:38,039
um and or preventative measure in that

12
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,558
uh you'd be fighting off the bad guys if

13
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,960
you will so let's say that we started

14
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:46,640
with a new clone right what would be

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,759
your tea of choice for a new transplant

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,600
into a sterile medium um I I tend to

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:59,238
lean more towards the fungal dominant

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,518
first why is that um so a lot of if

19
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:02,479
you're looking at

20
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:05,478
the roots of a plant underneath a

21
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,158
microscope you have the the main you

22
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:08,640
know in a lot of ways it mimics what

23
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,240
you'd see above ground so you have you

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,519
know kind of that main branch coming off

25
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,560
and then they'll be uh the root hairs um

26
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,239
and if you look at closer what you see

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,640
is it actually is kind of deceptive like

28
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:22,078
in a lot of ways your your skin so we

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,200
have hair coming off of our skin but we

30
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:29,000
also have holes in our skin in the form

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,520
of pores where um there are spaces that

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,640
are actually going inside side as well

33
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:35,199
so Roots have those and what ends up

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,319
happening with a lot of the um a lot of

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,280
the the the the fungus that we

36
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:43,118
introduced this is that they have a um

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,840
that they have a very close relationship

38
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,799
with the plant and that they will

39
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,000
actually plug into those pores and then

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,439
they themselves will snake out spiderweb

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,759
out into the

42
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:59,398
soil and actually extend the surface

43
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:02,799
area or multiply the surface area of um

44
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,920
that that plant is able to cover so a

45
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,640
plant route in of itself or just like me

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,920
standing here I can only Reach Out And

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,479
Touch what's immediately around me if I

48
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,519
am you know Spider-Man with a web

49
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,959
Slinger sh throwing out something while

50
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,239
I can grab something from across the

51
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,840
room and that's how the fungal hypi act

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,640
when they're in a direct relationship

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,959
with the plant so for early growth um

54
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,839
for for establishing that root system

55
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,080
and and getting it as strong as as

56
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,039
strong as possible as fast as as

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,719
possible and giving it immediate

58
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,719
immediate access to as much of that

59
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:39,719
surface area as possible I tend to to

60
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,560
want to lean towards fungal dominant

61
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,959
early so as the plant starts to get

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,158
established and is able to kind of

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,479
absorb what's immediately available in

64
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:51,318
whatever soil mix that you're using then

65
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:55,639
it starts to lean towards the breakdown

66
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:57,318
of the soil which although the the uh

67
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:59,399
the fungal growth definitely has a big

68
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:02,000
role to play in that as well but a lot

69
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,360
of the the I guess a little more diverse

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,639
side of that is really in in the biology

71
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,440
is is in the the the

72
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,958
bacterias um so the the bacterias are a

73
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,959
lot of the ones that create different

74
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:19,039
hormones create amino acids um the the

75
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,560
the lacto basilis and basilis will have

76
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,039
a little bit more um active or faster

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,360
role in in breaking things down

78
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,759
especially when you combine them all um

79
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,159
but they can also occupy a lot of that

80
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:34,598
same space that fungus would like to be

81
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,239
occupying so the fungal growth tends to

82
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:40,039
happen a little bit slower the bacterial

83
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,640
growth can happen relatively quickly um

84
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,438
and so that's the reason for kind of

85
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,119
establishing the the get getting the

86
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:49,000
fungal colonies established first and

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,560
then starting to transition into the

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,158
into the bacterial more bacterial

89
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,400
dominant and then as you get into late

90
00:03:54,158 --> 00:04:00,959
flower there are all kinds of specific

91
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,760
um species that are um

92
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,878
producing a lot of those growth

93
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:07,318
hormones and uh or there you know some

94
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,759
of them that will specifically break

95
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:13,199
down certain things in the soil faster

96
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:17,478
so early on we're more interested in in

97
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:19,519
nitrogen uh later on you know goes from

98
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:23,159
basically goes from n from from n to P

99
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,759
to K in terms of our focus of uh and the

100
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,040
plant's lifecycle so you can kind of you

101
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,919
can kind of tailor that a little bit

102
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,759
with the biology as well right on so I

103
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,639
know that for me you know it the the

104
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,879
similar mind frame and that you know the

105
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,879
fungal colonies get them developed first

106
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,000
and then the bacterias can break down

107
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,159
those things like You're mentioning

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,839
green sand and montr malite clay and

109
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,199
these very mineral Rich Trace element

110
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,079
Rich compounds that are not readily

111
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,000
available to the plant so the bacterias

112
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,120
that produce amino acids and enzymes

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,839
help the plant to make that bioavailable

114
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,399
and then I know for me that towards the

115
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,319
end of the life cycle especially in

116
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,599
flower and cannabis plant

117
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,439
um you run into a lot of the problems

118
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,199
towards the end and being an organic

119
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,160
cultivator um and a conscious cultivator

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,600
doesn't allow me to put any sprays on my

121
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,560
plants or do any of that topical

122
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,120
preventative measures um so what would

123
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,478
you utilize like what are some strands

124
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,280
you'd utilize say towards the end to

125
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:26,399
fight off a fusarium or pythium or

126
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:29,839
Bettis you know uh um there

127
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,279
are 50 different species

128
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,119
that you'll find in a lot of the

129
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,439
hydrocor mixes if you actually take any

130
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,639
of those names written on the back of

131
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,800
them and look them up online you'll see

132
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,120
what kind of effects they have and and a

133
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,879
lot of them are kind of on both sides

134
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,680
but they they're participating in in or

135
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:48,120
assisting with the breakdown of the soil

136
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,720
but they're also um they're also

137
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,280
antagonistic to any sort of pathogens in

138
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,160
the soil but then there are some that

139
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:58,638
are more aggressive than others um so

140
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,160
streptomyces actin actinovate yeah

141
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,759
streptomyces sold is actinovate is one

142
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,680
that that a lot of people use and it can

143
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,598
be also used as a foler although I think

144
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,680
it's soil born naturally comes from the

145
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:12,519
soil uh can also be sprayed as a foler

146
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,319
um something like that is a is a good

147
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:17,560
one to start adding into the te's as you

148
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,360
get a little bit later later on down the

149
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,680
road yeah um um I have a question for

150
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,639
you on that on the strepto my I've heard

151
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,759
that um you know one of the reasons why

152
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,918
you wouldn't want to use the

153
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,080
streptomyces early on as say a

154
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,279
preventative like why wouldn't you get

155
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:33,279
strept is in there right off the bat so

156
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,239
that that stuff can't come

157
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,598
in there are other species better suited

158
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,519
to that that are not going to actually

159
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:43,478
attack the fungal growth in the soil

160
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:44,959
that you do want and streptomyces and

161
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:46,519
again I'm not a biologist but my

162
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,799
understanding of streptomyces is that it

163
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,478
is a pretty

164
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,280
aggressive um pretty aggressive organism

165
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,439
when it comes to

166
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,638
attacking uh different funguses and

167
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,360
things like that and it doesn't

168
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,079
necessarily differentiate you know

169
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,879
there's going to be some different

170
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,120
some some of their preferred Foods

171
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,319
versus things that they wouldn't

172
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,759
necessarily prefer or wouldn't

173
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,560
necessarily want to bother with but um

174
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,840
that they are aggressive enough that

175
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,038
they can uh that they can have a little

176
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:15,119
bit of an effect on the the fungal

177
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,878
growth in the soil that we do want and I

178
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,560
don't necessarily know that to be true

179
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,960
that's more of an intuitive um you know

180
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,439
something that I think was more

181
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,878
intuitive for me in terms of my practice

182
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:30,120
but uh I didn't necessarily want to use

183
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,720
those things um right off the bat just

184
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,478
because you don't necessarily have to

185
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,440
but then as you get later on down the

186
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:36,839
road and you you know and the plants

187
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,839
start especially as the plants start to

188
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:42,038
reach the end of their life cycle and

189
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:44,478
they start to get weaker um they are

190
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:46,439
then subject to any of these things a

191
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,240
lot of them are systemic exist in nature

192
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:52,959
anyway you know like hero we are I think

193
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,000
they say that there's 20% of 20% of the

194
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,000
dust in the air is actually active mold

195
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,598
spores and things like that so these

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
things all exist in the environment

197
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:01,478
anyway it's not necessarily that you

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,319
need to have a plant that's contaminated

199
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:05,079
and then comb combine that with the fact

200
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,039
that a lot of the issues that we have

201
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:09,120
are systemic and they actually came from

202
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:11,519
you know they they've been with the

203
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,360
plant for a very long time uh that's the

204
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,758
stage of life where those things will

205
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,240
start to uh start to gain a little bit

206
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,280
more of a foothold now that the plant's

207
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,519
weaker and they they have kind of an

208
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:26,158
Avenue of attack um so as it gets later

209
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,639
on then I'll start transitioning from

210
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:30,038
start transitioning more into those

211
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:34,200
things that are really going to be

212
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:35,838
uh antagonistic to the pathogens U and

213
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,080
that's to to where by the end of the

214
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,599
life cycle that's really all you're

215
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,000
trying to put in there because the the

216
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,680
plant is it's got It's you know it's got

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,799
the majority of its nut the nutrients

218
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,719
that it's going to be using either in

219
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:51,240
the stored form of Bri you know

220
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,040
measuring bricks levels things like that

221
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,879
it's part of building up the bricks and

222
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:59,039
so the middle stage of using a lot of

223
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:00,759
those type of bacterias um uh will will

224
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,519
help to increase the bricks levels and

225
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:04,078
then that's a lot of the stored energy

226
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,919
for the plant and as you get down to the

227
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:08,639
last bit of the life cycle and you know

228
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:10,479
a lot of that stuff is is kind of

229
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,159
already set in motion you're not

230
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,480
necessarily as dependent especially if

231
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:18,278
you're supplementing Foods soluble foods

232
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,639
like we do a lot of times in laid flour

233
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:22,439
um you know you're supplementing like I

234
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,360
said from end to PK depending on where

235
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,680
you are in the life cycle and as you

236
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,120
transition from P to K and you get into

237
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:31,000
the end of the life cycle um you know

238
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,759
we're we're using Bloom boosters and

239
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,639
we're we're feeding them stuff that's

240
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,519
soluble which is also going to disrupt

241
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,159
the biology in the soil um prior to I

242
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,919
guess my personal approach early on for

243
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:43,838
a lot of this stuff is that you don't

244
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:46,199
want to feed them heavily ever really I

245
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,720
I don't lean towards that ever to you

246
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,240
know just pump full of steroids cuz it's

247
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,240
just it's not not how I would want to do

248
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,440
everything in

249
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,120
moderation um and and then as they get

250
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,920
to the later part of their life cycle it

251
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,879
just it to me it seems much more

252
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:07,439
um uh much more uh realistic or or My

253
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,759
intuition I guess then says to okay now

254
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,440
we've gotten pretty close to the end of

255
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,919
the road let's make sure we don't have

256
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,880
any problems and concentrate really on

257
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,240
um on the things that that are either

258
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,039
going to help the plant finish assuming

259
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,399
that it already has access to everything

260
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,480
else that it wants um either by

261
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,078
supplemental feeding CU you know end of

262
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,278
flour were always supplemental feeding

263
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:32,359
on some level uh uh so then then the

264
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,958
te's become more targeted towards pess

265
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,200
suppression disease disease suppression

266
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,000
things like that and then you can shift

267
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,440
that at any point in time too if you're

268
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,639
having um you if you're having specific

269
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,639
issues that you want to Target you know

270
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:49,000
so you have you have fungus gats or you

271
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:52,919
have uh roote aphids or you know things

272
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,440
like you then I wouldn't necessarily add

273
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,958
like the very basana is one that I use

274
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,040
for some of that stuff I wouldn't

275
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:02,479
necessarily add that to any te unless I

276
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:05,719
was interested in making sure that I'm

277
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,200
not going to end up with a fungus knot

278
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,920
explosion or rud aphids taking off or

279
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,560
anything like that then I would so later

280
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,039
on in the process I start to add things

281
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,518
like that more to the tea so I'll add

282
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,278
more of the streptomyces I'll add more

283
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:22,919
of the very vasana um subtilus is really

284
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:25,439
a good one for the whole process that

285
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:27,838
one also is is is an antagonist of a lot

286
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,920
of pathogens so those would be kind of

287
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,440
the three General t's for me would be

288
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,799
first fungal dominant and then

289
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,560
transitioning into something that's a

290
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,479
little bit more bacterial focused where

291
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,479
you have some of those um and anything

292
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,079
that's producing like a like a plant

293
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,680
growth hormone um and then towards the

294
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:48,479
end it's just making sure that we cross

295
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:50,638
the finish line uh you know in a strong

296
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,839
way and not not get all the way to the

297
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:57,720
finish line and then oh oh I can't move

298
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:01,480
yeah totally so one one peanut gallery

299
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,160
question uh I'm glad you mentioned

300
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:08,440
fungus uh do you think a lot of people

301
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:11,919
who GRE SE just sort of solely focus on

302
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,240
bacteria um and sort of forget about or

303
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,559
don't think about the importance of

304
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,440
fungus my experience with the majority

305
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,479
of people that are using te's or a lot

306
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,639
of people that I speak to using te's is

307
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,079
the the understanding of the difference

308
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:26,680
between a fungal dominant tea and a

309
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,399
bacterial dominant tea and what it takes

310
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,759
to achieve those two things is not

311
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,078
necessarily common knowledge and what it

312
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,240
requires a little more

313
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:38,198
investigation um and

314
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,480
uh

315
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:44,000
so I guess in a lot of cases it just

316
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,920
seems like a lack of a lack of

317
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,600
understanding of you know okay this is

318
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,958
what I'm trying to do this is why and

319
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,759
this is how I achieve it versus I've

320
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,000
heard I've heard compost te's work

321
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,198
really well and so I'm going to buy

322
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,078
these products and I'm going to combine

323
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:57,599
them in this rate that I found online

324
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,198
and I'm going to create a compost te and

325
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,920
I'm going to feed it to my plants but

326
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:04,159
the number of people that are doing it

327
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:06,479
and not able to actually

328
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,480
determine anything about their tea other

329
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,920
than the fact that it's brown and smells

330
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,360
the way they say it's supposed to smell

331
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:16,519
if you don't have a microscope to look

332
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,240
at it and actually see those life forms

333
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,039
and have I produced a bunch of fungal Hy

334
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:26,198
or have I produced a bunch of bacteria

335
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:28,039
and um it's like is that yeah so I I

336
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:29,359
think that in in my discussions with a

337
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:32,879
lot of people and a lot of lot of the

338
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,800
questions that I F is um that it it

339
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,078
takes a bit more sophistication and an

340
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,559
expensive microscope that you utilize to

341
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,319
look at your te's and see where your

342
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:43,159
te's are and if the balance is where it

343
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,320
needs to be and most people don't have

344
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:46,679
access to that and don't have the

345
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,560
knowledge of that but there are plenty

346
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:51,519
of good recipes out there for General

347
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,599
te's like you were saying basilla

348
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,078
subtilus is a good overall it kind of

349
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,639
works for everything and it's pretty

350
00:13:55,078 --> 00:14:00,879
easy to find in bagged mixes and then to

351
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:02,839
multiply into 5 gon with an AirStone so

352
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:06,958
um in general a lot of the tea recipes

353
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:09,240
come out as a general overall tea um but

354
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,879
when you get into production as large

355
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,879
and specific as we do here then you need

356
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,519
to know exactly what's going into your

357
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,159
tea and what's coming out of your tea um

358
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,720
so you know when to use it and if your

359
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:27,368
tea is ripe or not

360
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,369
