[Music]

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,118
we're talking about the future of

3
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,640
cannabis cultivation my name is Alex

oranic or cultivation Frenchie canoli

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,840
who is a legend in the hash

11
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:42,359
game and he was going to talk about

12
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,920
something very near and dear to my heart

13
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,679
but we'll get to that in a second and

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,760
David Holmes clay n who has overseen

15
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:53,320
several cultivation facilities in Nevada

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,878
in Arizona and also here in California

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,119
and I'm going to start with my thoughts

18
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,320
on the future of of canvas cultivation

19
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:01,320
and then we'll turn it over to Kyle

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,518
first to talk about his background what

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,438
he thinks I say the future of cannabis

22
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:08,319
cultivation the price is going down per

23
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:10,239
pound on a wholesale level that's the

24
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:15,199
only organizing principle I would

25
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:16,959
operate from but Kyle take it away sure

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,359
that's all sure that's all you want to

27
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:23,559
say it's going to go down that's a fair

28
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:26,920
bet but that's a good thing uh because

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,519
cannabis is medicine and even beyond

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,478
that it's the safest Recreation

31
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:36,438
intoxicant known to man and it should be

32
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:40,118
cheap and available for anybody who

33
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:42,839
wants to use it um the future of

34
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:45,200
cannabis cultivation it's really awesome

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,560
to be able to talk about that topic just

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,399
think about that we're not we're not

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,478
thinking about the past or how we're

38
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,640
going to get there we're actually you

39
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,599
know it's kind of like this boat we're

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:59,118
not going anywhere we've already arrived

41
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,959
you know and um we're it's really it

42
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,640
really feels really good I'm not saying

43
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,679
that uh any fight is over and if you

44
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,878
guys were lucky enough to listen to

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,400
Ethan nlman yesterday he gave an amazing

46
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,679
a really really inspiring speech and you

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,599
know the legalization of cannabis isn't

48
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,120
just about any one thing it's not just

49
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,878
about being able to get high or being

50
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,000
able to cure your illness it's not just

51
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:25,399
about the

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,400
economy you know and when we do legalize

53
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,120
cannabis hopefully we'll continue to

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,719
fight for the people who are in jail for

55
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,920
having a tiny little bit of cocaine or a

56
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,519
tiny little bit of any intoxicating

57
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,199
substance that they decided to use and

58
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,000
not lose their freedoms and tie them up

59
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:44,518
in jail forever so

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,598
um the future of cannabis is is is

61
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,800
freaking bright man it's it's a hybrid

62
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:53,479
of everything it's a hybrid of indoor

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:57,640
and outdoor and um uh um uh light

64
00:02:53,479 --> 00:03:01,518
deprivation using all seasons and um you

65
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:03,878
know it's a big wide open uh space for

66
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,480
entrepreneurial uh enterprising people

67
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:10,840
young and old who have a passion um for

68
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,840
this plant or for for the

69
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,878
industry but you think the price is

70
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,560
going

71
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,560
down you answer the

72
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,599
question because I can't I keep losing

73
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,878
these Consulting gigs because I start

74
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:27,479
with that I'm like price is going down

75
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:30,280
and they don't hire me I don't get

76
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,079
it yeah it the the the price is going to

77
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,400
go down for a lot of reasons it's going

78
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,000
to go down because of the supply it's

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,120
going to go down because better

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,598
practices it's going to go down because

81
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,280
it should go down because people

82
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,359
shouldn't have to pay $25 for a gram of

83
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,680
marijuana that's smoked up in a joint

84
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,680
here

85
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,519
[Applause]

86
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,759
here and with that let's move on to

87
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,158
Frenchie

88
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,479
canoli and you don't have to answer my

89
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,679
question oh actually but I want to talk

90
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,719
to you about

91
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,079
Terr uh but it's all go together

92
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:08,158
basically it's not a question of price

93
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:12,040
it's for the moment you are facing a

94
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:15,000
choice every producing country in the

95
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:19,238
world produce

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,720
quantity and not quality you could be

97
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:27,279
the first

98
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:30,280
ever producing country producing only

99
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:34,079
quality and I'm not talking on only

100
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:37,959
about us small small farmers I'm talking

101
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,719
about the wall industry in California

102
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,279
it's a huge choice that you have in

103
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,240
front of you it's a huge Edge on the

104
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:47,638
market so before thinking that price are

105
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,960
going to go down yeah price are going to

106
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,038
go down if you don't produce quality but

107
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,439
price are not going to go down if you

108
00:04:53,038 --> 00:05:00,319
produce quality because the world is

109
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:03,639
open very soon to a World Market if if

110
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,038
legalization happen here in California

111
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,160
and in a few other states there is

112
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:10,599
country like Morocco there is many

113
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,199
country around the world that produce

114
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:18,360
vast quantity of cannabis derivative

115
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:21,439
that won't absolutely to be legal too so

116
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,680
it's like it's not only a choice that

117
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:27,439
you make in this small Market of

118
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,160
California and and the US it's a a world

119
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:34,719
choice that you're making like the wine

120
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:38,960
industry did in the 18th century after

121
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,880
13,000 years of mass production black

122
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:46,279
market and any things you could add to

123
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:49,719
the wine to make it his lifetime longer

124
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:51,159
they decided to go to Quality to Quality

125
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,520
because they had no choice they were

126
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,479
facing

127
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:58,879
competition and in a history book you

128
00:05:55,478 --> 00:06:01,719
have literally a blueprint how to not

129
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,719
only protect your farmer but that their

130
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,599
land is so valuable because it's not the

131
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,120
price of the land anymore it's what the

132
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:13,519
LA produce something so unique that it's

133
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,598
a brand worldwide and that's called an

134
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,240
appellation controller you have

135
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:22,879
everything every part here in many

136
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,680
different places of California where

137
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,279
there is everything to create what the

138
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,560
wine industry

139
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:35,000
created 60 years ago so it's your choice

140
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,720
it's like do you want to make a lot of

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,598
money short time and to be just one of

142
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,960
the other Mass producing cannabis

143
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:45,598
country in the world or do you want to

144
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,560
be the reference to the world of

145
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:51,079
cannabis in the future like the the wine

146
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,319
IND the street looking at Bordeaux and

147
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:58,079
France so I I think I lost my mic lost

148
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,439
hello I figured out the answer to your

149
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,198
question it is that price is going to

150
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:05,959
both go up and go

151
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:09,439
down and Frenchie is

152
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:11,038
extremely smart in this area and to

153
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,319
expand on his thought what's going to

154
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:17,120
happen is is that cheap grade marijuana

155
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,439
is going to get cheaper and high-grade

156
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,918
marijuana is going to become more valued

157
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:26,079
so that's what came to me by listening

158
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,079
to French

159
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,199
I'll respond to that after we let David

160
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:37,159
talk check okay you guys can hear

161
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,840
me U Can you guys hear me pretty good

162
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,199
all right so you know I was thinking

163
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,959
about the future of cannabis cultivation

164
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,000
and I realized it was a difficult

165
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:49,478
question to answer how it's going to

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,478
turn out so I decided to think about all

167
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:54,038
the different cultivation types that

168
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:56,240
currently exist and the products that

169
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:58,439
they currently create and how maybe

170
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,478
those products would evolve and those

171
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,598
types of cultivation would evolve with

172
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,758
the types of uh canvas they produce so

173
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:09,240
I'm just going to do it a little more

174
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,280
analytically and kind of my style um so

175
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,439
if we start at you know the top indoor

176
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,638
cultivation currently indoor cultivation

177
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:20,360
produces in terms of retail value the

178
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,478
highest value flowers and the trim that

179
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,439
comes from indoor currently produces the

180
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,560
highest uh retail value extract I'm not

181
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,879
saying it's necessarily better than

182
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,879
Greenhouse or sungrown but in our retail

183
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,560
Market it produces a higher retail value

184
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:39,360
the indoor cultivation does uh pretty

185
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,439
much in all of its offshoots uh when you

186
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,158
move down to the greenhouse product the

187
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,399
greenhouse is definitely getting better

188
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,159
and it's becoming a competitor of indoor

189
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,000
and currently the a lot of the

190
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:55,679
greenhouse flow goes to

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,679
um you know the dispensary retail Market

192
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,039
it I think it still has less of a retail

193
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,278
value uh in dispens reason I'm just

194
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:05,919
talking about my experience in Los

195
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:08,519
Angeles um but this is what I've

196
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,240
realized and the extract that comes from

197
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,159
the greenhouse is also a competitive

198
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,240
indoor so I think indoor and Greenhouse

199
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:18,639
are competitors and they're going to be

200
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,320
competing for specific products I think

201
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,039
the sun grown is a

202
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,440
different entity it's a different Beast

203
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,319
altoe and the product it creates is

204
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,279
unique and I think the future of of of

205
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,680
sun grown is probably going to be the

206
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:36,360
largest segment of the market and I

207
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:38,319
think as the greenhouse and indoor uh

208
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,680
compete with each other that connoisseur

209
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,560
Market that you guys are talking about

210
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,120
is going to fight its way out now I'm

211
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,799
not saying there isn't a connoisseur

212
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,959
sungrown Market I think that's a

213
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:50,639
separate connoisseur Market people that

214
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,958
like indoor or Greenhouse

215
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,838
flow probably aren't going to be the

216
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,559
people that are going to transition to

217
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,600
sunr I think they're separate separate

218
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:04,199
uh customers but um um in terms of the

219
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,240
evolution as greenhouse and indoor fight

220
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,200
it out and Greenhouse becomes Hightech

221
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,680
and could do a lot of the things that

222
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:15,560
the indoor flower could do I think that

223
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:18,000
at some point indoor may lose the battle

224
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,919
because of the cost associated with it

225
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,639
um now there are a couple of things I

226
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:26,719
think indoor could do to stay in the

227
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:29,399
game and one is data data collection

228
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,320
data analysis if you look uh at at like

229
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:36,078
an indoor grow it has so much control

230
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,959
there's tons of variables that you could

231
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:43,519
analyze you could control I'm talking

232
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:46,479
the temperature humidity VPD Daily Light

233
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,519
integral dis alled doxygen content of

234
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,120
your nutrient Reservoir um you can look

235
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,600
at the tpin I mean these are all things

236
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,320
you could do in any of the types of

237
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,519
cultivation but in an indoor the type of

238
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,320
control you have gives you an advantage

239
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,600
to go the far the pharmace tical route

240
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,720
which I I I think in any of the classes

241
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,800
the indoor gives you the most control to

242
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,800
to produce a pharmaceutical clean room

243
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:13,919
type flower that the others can't and I

244
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,319
think that's the only saving grace of

245
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,120
the indoor in the long long run I I

246
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,600
still think it has legs for many years

247
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,639
but anyway yes the price will go down

248
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,159
but okay it's G to that's all that's

249
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:29,360
what I was really on average it

250
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,799
will um I have a specific question

251
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,200
question I'll start with Kyle I've never

252
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:37,919
grown indoor with LED lights have you

253
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,240
ever grown with neither have I if any of

254
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:43,639
you grown with LED

255
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,519
okay does it work because it seems to be

256
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,240
the

257
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:50,200
future it is a

258
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,720
future uh it is the future because it

259
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,480
save electricity and because LED

260
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,360
industry has not been improved for over

261
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,560
80 years it's so economic nobody wanted

262
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,240
to give some that they could not sell

263
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:07,679
and resell on a very regular basis it's

264
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,519
not been touched

265
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:13,719
until like until we came into play and I

266
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,839
I play around with one of the first

267
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:21,480
really good LED and yeah because you can

268
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,680
pretty much copy and get close to to the

269
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,039
Spectrum you

270
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:28,919
want and it's all about mimicking as

271
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:32,078
close as possible the the sun Spectrum

272
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:34,120
so yeah to a point in the future it's

273
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:37,879
going to make a lot of difference for

274
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,120
them Indo because it's so cost effective

275
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:42,278
let me just ask you a follow-up question

276
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,480
about mimicking the sun indoors do you

277
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:46,879
as part of your cultivation technique do

278
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,440
you also reduce the amount of sunlight

279
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:54,879
hours as the cycle goes on yes yes I do

280
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:58,920
so you move from say 18 186 to

281
00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:00,799
177 so forth down until 1014 at the end

282
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:04,519
yeah don't follow it as as strict as

283
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,479
that you know maybe 20 to 18 to 16 to 12

284
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:09,198
and then at the end you know maybe the

285
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,600
last two weeks dropping it to 10 or 11

286
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:13,838
to 10 and then also the amount of light

287
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,159
intensity I think is important because

288
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,959
you know in the if you're trying to

289
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:20,519
mimic outdoor as the season goes on

290
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,000
October November you're not getting as

291
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,879
much total light so I I like to try to

292
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,720
replicate that as much as possible by

293
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:29,519
lowering the amount of light intensity

294
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,600
also and then what about about yield

295
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,679
with

296
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,519
LED um you know I have some some

297
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:39,159
experiments we did build like a like a

298
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:42,720
400 square foot LED experimental room

299
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:45,000
and the uh quality is always really good

300
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,519
I I think the only issue with LED in my

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,240
opinion was the inconsistency it's hard

302
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,720
to get a really uniform light across the

303
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,000
the canopy with LED and I think that's

304
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,800
really because do you have to put them

305
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
really close together you got to put

306
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,799
them yeah you got to put them close

307
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,639
together I mean if there's a way that

308
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,278
they can create a higher intensity

309
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,000
enough LED that you could get that

310
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,799
distance to make a really even light

311
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,919
spread I think there's a big future for

312
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:13,879
Led but I think there there still is a

313
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,919
big future in uh in you know vegging in

314
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,519
the veg stage and also in cloning and

315
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,639
you know also in supplemental lighting

316
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,399
and Greenhouse potentially so I think

317
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,799
LEDs have a big future in in a lot of

318
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,278
the different cultivation

319
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,639
types you mentioned something about

320
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:33,439
medical sort of being the in preferred

321
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,799
for indoor which I I can see just on a

322
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,240
personal level if you given the choice

323
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,120
would you rather smoke a joint that's

324
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,799
all sungrown or outdoor or would you

325
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,480
rather smoke a joint that's indoor and

326
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,679
I'll ask each of you that question I'll

327
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,440
start with you

328
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:54,159
first um you know it that's a that's a

329
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,560
very tough question I've had great great

330
00:14:54,159 --> 00:15:00,240
sungrown uh flower rolled into a joint

331
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:03,159
um but I would say I'm a little biased

332
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,240
cuz I'm an indoor grower well just a

333
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:09,360
little so uh currently yeah my favorite

334
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,399
if I were going to put any flour I could

335
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,560
choose it would be my indoor flour into

336
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,078
a joint to smoke it just because of the

337
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:20,000
cleanliness and and uh the I mean the

338
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,039
cultivation rooms that I run are pretty

339
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,159
much like clean rooms and I I like that

340
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:26,919
stability you know about it but so let

341
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,559
me just are you growing in Rockwell are

342
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:31,159
you growing in potting soil and half

343
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,518
Coco you're going rock wol rock see I've

344
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:33,559
never been able to get good purple out

345
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,399
of rock

346
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:39,159
wool so got to just crank the temps down

347
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,799
the last yeah I know the temps but that

348
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:42,078
doesn't always do it I find the light

349
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,519
cycle actually has more to do it than

350
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:49,359
the temperatures but Frenchie outdoor

351
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,639
indoor take a stand uh outdoor all day

352
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,959
right it's like when when you're dealing

353
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:59,519
with a living organism that is aware of

354
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:00,958
his habitat and everything that is there

355
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,120
that

356
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:08,479
literally control every mobile being in

357
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,879
the air and underground the plant call

358
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,720
every microb underground to break her

359
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,720
food for the food to be available at the

360
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,560
right time she call she call every

361
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:24,000
insect every Predator she she can do

362
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:27,278
everything she Rule and that power you

363
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,039
cannot duplicate it you be by becoming

364
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:33,120
the master in a grow room it's not the

365
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:37,039
same plant that you're working with

366
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,919
that's why it's very difficult to grow

367
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:43,278
outdoor a strain that has been breeded

368
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:46,519
indoor and vice versa in the Thousand

369
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:49,000
Year if we had more 100 years or so or

370
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:53,120
200 years

371
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,399
of Prohibition that plant would become

372
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:00,399
very so away from what we know that it

373
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:03,039
could become a subsp is like we've been

374
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,880
thinking that sativa and Inda it's like

375
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:09,078
she's so adaptive but it's another

376
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:13,000
creation all together there is no way

377
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:15,678
you can give me what Gan is growing in

378
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,880
his garden that plant that is been

379
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:23,000
breeded in that Garden is so powerful

380
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,240
it's so unique that the neighbor cannot

381
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,558
do it there is no way you can you can

382
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,558
get that because the plant is exuding

383
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:34,918
all terpe and all all our life it's

384
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,240
according to her habitat so you're

385
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:40,559
getting something that is super unique

386
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,440
in itself but we can't literally compare

387
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,960
it's really a question of choice

388
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,519
literally yeah no I I agree the uh the

389
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,640
the the breeding that has been done the

390
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,679
last 10 years for indoor plants makes

391
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,200
them unique you take an indoor OG

392
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:59,120
outside it's it's a lot more difficult

393
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:02,159
to grow it so I agree with you yeah well

394
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:05,558
David you're lucky you went first

395
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:07,240
because I don't know why or how anyone

396
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:08,558
would want to contradict anything that

397
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,079
Frenchie just

398
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:14,720
said so I'm going to use comedy to

399
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:19,319
deflect my nervousness on my

400
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:23,640
answer um but I I I I do have a few

401
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:26,359
opinions on it and um I also prefer to

402
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,960
to smoke indoor flow for the following

403
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:32,959
reasons um

404
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,038
it has to do with kaix to Leaf ratio now

405
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,360
Frenchie everything Frenchie said I have

406
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,000
to I have to say is is absolutely true

407
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,519
because you're dealing with a

408
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,960
living I'm not going to say sensient but

409
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:48,119
a you're live you're dealing with a

410
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:51,519
living organism and no matter how great

411
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:54,639
a grower you are it's not plugged into

412
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,038
the Earth it's not feeling any of the

413
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:01,600
magnetic energy vibration from the earth

414
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:03,240
so it's not and then to go beyond that

415
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,000
it's a completely different animal I

416
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,400
like to say indoor and outdoor weed is a

417
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,279
completely different animal because no

418
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,720
matter how many how much I like to mimic

419
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:15,678
nature or how much my Mantra or my ethos

420
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,919
is to mimic nature how many times I

421
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,720
change that timer how many times I

422
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,240
change the bulbs and try to blend the

423
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,519
lighting it doesn't matter it's not the

424
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,599
same as what how the plant evolved to

425
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:29,000
have the sun rise and set every day at a

426
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:32,199
different time and have the Sun travel

427
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,119
through the sky and

428
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:39,600
so o to Frenchie

429
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:41,199
because he he speaks the truth um but I

430
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,480
like smoking indoor flower because of

431
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,480
the kaix to Leaf ratio so outdoor plants

432
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,960
are naturally going to grow more Leaf

433
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,839
because the light intensity is lower the

434
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:57,079
plant wants to capture more Rays so it

435
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:59,199
grows more Leaf okay so outdoor bud is

436
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:02,720
almost always

437
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,840
going to have a low a higher Leaf to Kix

438
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,480
ratio as opposed to indoor not always

439
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:12,240
absolutely not always almost always okay

440
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,880
but so if you take that outdoor weed and

441
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,919
you clean it properly and you remove all

442
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,280
of the leaf material that I personally

443
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,720
don't want to

444
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,839
smoke now you're talking about something

445
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,480
truly special that you have there when

446
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,240
you're talking about the resin glands

447
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,960
that Frenchie works with okay I'm not

448
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,759
talking about smoking a flower from a

449
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,679
stick that came from a stalk outside

450
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:38,480
there is a difference between that

451
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:40,360
flower and the indoor flower but there

452
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,759
is also a profound

453
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:44,879
difference between the resin glands of

454
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,879
the

455
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:54,119
two thank you for that I'm

456
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,839
outdoor I mean you I know you guys make

457
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:59,079
your living on indoor so we'll just

458
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:02,240
leave it at that and

459
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:05,359
personally when I smoke a joint and I

460
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,120
it's from Mother Earth it has a I I

461
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,399
don't know I can get more canabo out of

462
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,959
you know I that's just my personal I I

463
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,159
need to say also that you know we're all

464
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,480
a product of our environment you know

465
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,720
and where I come from upstate New York

466
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,798
and there was literally a a proverb in

467
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,319
Upstate New York for The Growers and it

468
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:23,879
went like this you needed to have five

469
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,839
plants for every one you wanted to keep

470
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,159
when you grew Outdoors you needed one

471
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,519
for mother nature you needed one for the

472
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,278
pl the animals you needed one for the

473
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:35,240
cops you needed one for the thieves and

474
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:37,038
then you got to keep the fifth one and I

475
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,200
personally didn't like those odds so I

476
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,558
went indoors there you go product of our

477
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,840
environment you know so I got good at

478
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:48,678
what I do but I also think I would love

479
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,079
to grow outdoors Under the Sun I would I

480
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,320
I I personally grow in dirt okay because

481
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:54,798
I don't feel like unless I get dirt

482
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,000
under my nails I'm not farming it's not

483
00:21:54,798 --> 00:22:02,278
farming it's cultivating but it's not

484
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,240
farming so no disrespect at all I'm

485
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:06,679
just alliterating well I think a big

486
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,079
part of the outdoor versus indoor is

487
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,120
also the marketplace and the largest

488
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,960
Marketplace is Los Angeles and the

489
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:16,959
dispensaries in Los Angeles they want

490
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,919
well manicured Frosty pretty Buds and

491
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,360
the stuff that comes from outdoor

492
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,600
doesn't always look like that and I

493
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,240
think as consumers get more educated we

494
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:28,119
might see more outdoor cannabis yeah but

495
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:33,120
if you think that they are the one who

496
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:35,000
educ ated the public to the indoor it's

497
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:39,439
like most people have never smoked

498
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,798
outdoor here you judge a flower on

499
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:46,278
appearance when the whole experience is

500
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:49,079
all gustatory I just don't get

501
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:51,599
it so it's like it's all a question of

502
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:54,199
Education put some flower on the table

503
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:56,399
and you don't say anybody what it is and

504
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,558
you have everybody smoke I'd like to see

505
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,240
the result I I would to it's the pallet

506
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:04,440
you're right it is the pallet but the

507
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,240
average across the board the average

508
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,519
outdoor bud when you just roll it and

509
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,558
smoke it the way is is going to contain

510
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,599
more Leaf matter and that leaf makes it

511
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,759
harsh on the back of the throat so more

512
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:18,759
people choose the indoor

513
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:21,599
Bud where for the people who do Harvest

514
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:24,319
before the Cales are totally formed

515
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:28,519
because I know personally a bunch of

516
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:33,000
grower their their outdoor are sold as

517
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:35,480
Indo in very very high hand dispensaries

518
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,558
and that's all the dispensaries that

519
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:42,200
I've been keeping the indoor as the

520
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:45,158
uniqueness of it because that's where

521
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,319
the best market and the best profit are

522
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:51,320
now we are just starting to talk about

523
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:54,119
the the sun grown but we are far from it

524
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:57,759
because most people have not ever smoked

525
00:23:54,119 --> 00:24:00,038
one but if you give them the choice they

526
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:03,278
would go for on indoor while you don't

527
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:05,798
have ever choose tested the outdoor so

528
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:08,919
it's mostly a question of Education the

529
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:11,599
market you educate the market whichever

530
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:14,559
way you want when you're the one who run

531
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:18,038
the show it's like the dispensaries have

532
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:20,879
been running the show and deciding the

533
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:22,759
deciding basically quality and standard

534
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,559
and what goes on the menu who should

535
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:27,599
create the standard it's the grower that

536
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:31,720
should create the standard the grower

537
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:34,798
and the lab for the moment we

538
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:39,240
cannot we cannot really speak of quality

539
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:41,960
because we do not have quity

540
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,679
standard fair enough thank you I'd like

541
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,519
to move on to another topic really

542
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:50,840
quickly you guys are three esteemed

543
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,000
Growers and a lot of people in this room

544
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,519
may not grow canas or think you're

545
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,679
getting started in growing cannabis I'd

546
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,519
like each of you if you could give one

547
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,320
piece of advice to beginning grower

548
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,879
starting with David what what if you

549
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:02,158
could just give one person one piece of

550
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,159
advice about growing cannabis what would

551
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:08,480
it be um I would say first read a lot of

552
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:11,320
books make sure that you realize that

553
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,000
it's a very complicated process takes

554
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:17,038
many many many years of hard work to

555
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,640
master and it's not just like a get-rich

556
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,798
scheme you know you know a lot of people

557
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,960
think getting into the industry I'm

558
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:24,519
going to grow a lot of pot I'm going to

559
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:29,480
sell make a lot of money well it's not

560
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:33,440
that easy um also I would say

561
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,519
um make sure that you you know depending

562
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,600
on where you are I mean we're in

563
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,720
California we're close to you know

564
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,038
hopefully getting over the hump but you

565
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,679
know there's still issues with uh you

566
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:45,839
know cops kicking indoors it's still

567
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,320
happening in California to this day so

568
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:51,599
check out your local law and read a lot

569
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:53,439
those are my two bits of

570
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,000
advice

571
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,080
Kyle

572
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,558
um simply start small

573
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:04,879
uh because observation is key and um if

574
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:08,200
you're overwhelmed trying to learn

575
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,919
systems you know how the HVAC works and

576
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,919
you know where you should where the

577
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,360
vents for the uh dehumidifier should be

578
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,520
as opposed to the exhaust for the AC and

579
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:17,359
if you're trying to learn all these

580
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,599
systems then you're not going to have

581
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:23,119
time to focus on the plan so if you're

582
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:25,480
really getting started just start small

583
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,759
and um and like I like to say learn the

584
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,759
language of the plan it's all

585
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,398
observation you look at the plan

586
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:33,440
and it will tell you whether what you're

587
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:35,439
doing is a positive or A negative effect

588
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,840
and then you get the confidence and then

589
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,759
you can go bigger and you can

590
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,278
concentrate on learning

591
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:43,798
more

592
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:48,359
Frenchie uh me I'm actually not a

593
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:52,440
grower but I I am like a wine maker I

594
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:56,398
receive the Bounty of the grower and

595
00:26:52,440 --> 00:27:00,360
what you want is to wait for the peak of

596
00:26:56,398 --> 00:27:03,119
the flowering cycle you want perfect

597
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:06,959
ripeness that's

598
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,959
my you wait you

599
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:12,960
don't of

600
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,480
time friend she's absolutely correct the

601
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,480
amount of time that you put in

602
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,319
cultivating those plants how many times

603
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,960
you had to water them how many times you

604
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,960
had to transplant them and prune them

605
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,240
and prop them up and give love to them

606
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,120
and you're going to pull it in a week

607
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,399
early because you're going to be Hasty

608
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,759
or you're going to hang it up and you're

609
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,038
going to dry it really quickly because

610
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,000
you're hasty

611
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,879
absolutely not this man is not going to

612
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,558
appre appreciate working with material

613
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,559
like that trust

614
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,119
me Agreed

615
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:54,480
100% maybe me for ash maker you really

616
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:58,678
receive the final expression of the

617
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:01,960
plant the world magical process of trans

618
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:04,759
transformation of the bounding of two

619
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,640
molecules that you find in Spade in a

620
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:12,200
plant kingdom happen in that little

621
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:14,960
resin head so for me I don't make

622
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:18,679
quality I receive quality I'm like a

623
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,440
wine maker or a chef I'm depending on my

624
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:24,840
Farmer to receive that quality that's

625
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,640
why for me to to protect them and to

626
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:30,158
make people realize how important they

627
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:34,200
are to to this industry there is no

628
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:38,559
industry without those people but more

629
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,880
than this here in California you have

630
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,839
something that is called the terar you

631
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,240
wanted to ask me about it that's what I

632
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:48,599
was going to ask you about next the ter

633
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:52,558
it's something when if you don't go as

634
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:55,719
deep as a wine maker the ter it's the

635
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:58,599
uniqueness and the power of the land the

636
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:01,640
land is so powerful that

637
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:06,719
every plant on the planet was born only

638
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:10,080
in one place and then they adapted to to

639
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,399
other it has so much in it that it

640
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:16,278
literally give makes the plant the plant

641
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:19,079
is made from the water it receive from

642
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:23,398
the ground and the sun of the Ray it's

643
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:26,798
like it makes everything and here in

644
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:30,199
many places you have the geology that

645
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:33,639
make the soil very special you have

646
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:37,240
microclimat by the Android you have the

647
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:40,840
genetic that is became heirloom there is

648
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:43,880
all the all the genetic that is around

649
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:46,599
the world the land race they were born

650
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,840
in one place and move from that place to

651
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:53,240
wherever they are now in before becoming

652
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:56,879
L race they were heirloom a plant that

653
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:59,278
is adapted to our new habit but didn't

654
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,320
become something

655
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:05,679
totally adapted to it if I can explain

656
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:10,079
it like that this is unique there is no

657
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:12,798
other place in a planet with that type

658
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:15,798
of

659
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:19,759
cannabis cultiva potential it's

660
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:22,599
literally a National Treasure and if we

661
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:26,158
have something that we really need to do

662
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:29,599
it's to protect Z pooket Emerald

663
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,440
Triangle verac Cruz semity there is a

664
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:35,480
bunch of little pocket like this because

665
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,240
if we protect them and we can make the

666
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,759
world understand that there is a

667
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,558
cannabis Tero we can have appellation

668
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:46,278
control so that nobody in the world can

669
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:49,798
use a world Mand doino nobody in the

670
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:53,119
world can use umol like you cannot use

671
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:56,480
champagne you can use a metodology you

672
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:58,558
can use Spectrum in your lump that mimic

673
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,360
or or

674
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:05,359
special climate you can you can make

675
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:08,199
soil that mimic the soil you will have

676
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:14,199
but you will never be able to do what we

677
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:17,679
do and this is this is what what is the

678
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,759
the core foundation of the wine industry

679
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:23,960
it's a multibillion dollar industry it

680
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:26,599
started in one little city in front and

681
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,278
in front of you you can do that so it's

682
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:32,319
not only make making money in the

683
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:36,079
industry but do you want to become the

684
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:39,038
bord of the of the Cannabis industry

685
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:41,960
that the world world has a reference to

686
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:44,558
you that all standard of quality are

687
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:48,440
made by our grower and our lab that's

688
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:52,278
what we want because Beyond making money

689
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:55,720
it's qualities that will set us apart

690
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:59,679
it's being the standard of everything

691
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,679
that will really bring

692
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,278
Financial Freedom but for a generation

693
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,519
after generation it's not only for you

694
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:12,519
today it's for all the generation that

695
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,519
come

696
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,480
and and I and I want to add that um

697
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,558
there is actually a language written

698
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,399
into prop 64 uh called the Appalachia

699
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:25,200
rule I don't know why it's called that

700
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:28,959
but that's I believe I'm stating it

701
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:32,720
right and they're creating um brands for

702
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,000
Sonoma for meno for humbold that uh you

703
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,038
know will not be able to be infringed on

704
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,798
in other parts of the world so that

705
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:44,359
these communities that have created

706
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:46,638
these valuable um not Commodities but

707
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:49,038
um what what's the word I'm looking for

708
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:52,519
Brands

709
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:56,839
orual you know these things will be kept

710
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:59,038
in on in the home front you know and and

711
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:02,759
so yes on

712
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:05,079
64 I second that um da David I know that

713
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,398
you U managed several large scale

714
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:09,798
cultivation projects and I think

715
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:12,278
something people are afraid of is big

716
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:14,278
marijuana but I think it's inevitable

717
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:15,919
given the money that's behind everything

718
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:17,919
can you talk a little bit about the

719
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,600
future of cannabis cultivation as it

720
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,919
relates to large scale projects and

721
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,798
where where the difficulties are in

722
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,679
large scale projects well you know for

723
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,158
sure the difficulty in the large scale

724
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:30,120
is to produce the quality uh that you

725
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:33,760
know a smaller scale cultivator kid

726
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:36,319
produce and you know personally I I

727
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,359
wouldn't want a 30,000 foot facility you

728
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:41,398
know to produce quality I I think it's

729
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:42,879
very difficult to do on that scale um

730
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:44,839
it's also difficult when you have

731
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,679
investors that don't want you to run

732
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:51,278
strains out to 90 days or 80 days so I I

733
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:53,440
I think that you know The Connoisseur

734
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,759
Growers the the cultivators that focus

735
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,120
on really high quality don't have to

736
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:03,278
worry about those 30,000 foot facilities

737
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:05,959
producing quality like they

738
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:09,039
produce as long as they you know do all

739
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:12,838
the things that they do the the care

740
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:15,800
they put into the plants um and you know

741
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:17,759
the things that that uh an investor

742
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,839
wouldn't think about you know they're

743
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,000
thinking B like every large scale

744
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:25,239
cultivation facility that I've been a

745
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,119
part of has an invest has investors that

746
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,638
has specific bottom line they're trying

747
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,358
to meet and they're not necessarily

748
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,000
going after quality so I would say it's

749
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,559
going to be difficult for them to hit

750
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,519
the quality of the smaller scale right I

751
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:41,279
think one thing that gets lost in the

752
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:42,679
Cannabis cultivation future is you can

753
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,639
look at the alcohol industry in terms of

754
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,800
craft beer 10 years ago it was Budweiser

755
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,399
and Miller and now Budweiser and Miller

756
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,679
are buying every Craft brewery they can

757
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:55,199
I think there's room in the Cannabis

758
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,240
industry for the smaller cultivators who

759
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:01,078
have who have a better product and maybe

760
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,399
a unique product and and and so I'm

761
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,280
excited about all the different strains

762
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,680
we're hopefully going to get to see when

763
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,680
prop 64

764
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:09,719
passes Kyle have you have you worked on

765
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:13,679
any large scale projects

766
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:18,719
in uh few just recently gotten uh you

767
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:22,559
know out of the garage and um you know

768
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:26,399
uh uh the the rental house type

769
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:29,039
situation into the uh you know warehouse

770
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,000
space and uh fortunate to grow you know

771
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,559
with uh some legal

772
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,599
dispensaries um yeah I have some

773
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:36,559
definitely have some commercial

774
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,400
experience but what do you think the the

775
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:39,440
biggest what's the biggest issue for

776
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,599
large scale do you think it's the

777
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,240
quality

778
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:47,760
issue well I'm about to tackle that and

779
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:50,759
fortunately um for me I think that it's

780
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,000
all about the people that you hire to

781
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,880
work with you and

782
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,920
um yeah there's a bottom line um but I'm

783
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,400
not concerned with that and uh I'm more

784
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,680
concerned with uh creating jobs for for

785
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,680
people that want to be in the industry

786
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:12,239
and so I'm going to stay away from

787
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,358
machine trimming and I'm going to bring

788
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,039
in

789
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:18,480
dozens dozens and dozens of hand

790
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:21,400
trimmers that I'm going to personally

791
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,000
train on how how to trim and I'm going

792
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,318
to train the trim manager and the trim

793
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,719
manager is going to be responsible for

794
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:30,759
making sure that that quality level

795
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:32,118
stays up you know um and you know it's a

796
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,160
it's still in the dream phase a little

797
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:36,599
bit are you a naked flower guy excuse me

798
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,118
are you a naked flower guy I'm not

799
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:41,160
exactly sure what you cut all the leaves

800
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:43,680
off the flowers uh well absolutely for

801
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:46,559
for sale commercially you want that bud

802
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:49,358
to look as you just want to smoke the

803
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:52,119
meat of the flour you want the fet Manan

804
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,119
you want to give a little spread on that

805
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,880
when you're trimming so that the leaf

806
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,000
stem pops out and you take the point of

807
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,400
the scissors and you take every little

808
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,440
Leaf stem out so that when you're done

809
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,200
you have a a bud that has a unique shape

810
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,599
to it because it hasn't been haircut bud

811
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:07,879
I call it it when they just hold it and

812
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,160
just go up around the sides you just

813
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,838
carefully remove each leaf and you have

814
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:14,159
to constantly move the scissors in the

815
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,838
buds and it's it's laborious but you

816
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:17,719
know there are people that do it really

817
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:21,400
really well I lived in mesino for about

818
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:26,000
four or five years and I met uh troops

819
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:28,800
of Housewives who made a really good

820
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,079
living going from from place to place

821
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,480
they they they would come to my house

822
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,039
and I would call them up and I'd let

823
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,920
them know a couple days ahead of time

824
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:38,239
because as you know when you're getting

825
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,358
ready to trim might be tomorrow might be

826
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,959
the next day you're not exactly sure so

827
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,480
if you really want to do this properly

828
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,599
you got these people waiting they come

829
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,039
over they do their business now

830
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,280
unfortunately there was a high incidence

831
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,239
of carpal tunnel syndrome so we're going

832
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,760
to need a trimmer Union so that we can

833
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:59,439
get them health

834
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,440
benefits okay all right

835
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,359
can can you tell us a little bit about

836
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,160
the line of of you're creating the

837
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:06,239
veganics can you talk a little bit about

838
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:09,358
that because I'm not familiar with it

839
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:12,959
and I'm not sure sure um vegan Matrix is

840
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:15,318
a veganic plant nutrient line that's uh

841
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,800
complete you don't have to buy I've been

842
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:21,759
growing with solely vegan Matrix

843
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:23,480
products and uh beneficial organisms for

844
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,079
I I've stopped losing track I think it's

845
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,079
about six years now I think we're going

846
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,440
on six

847
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,280
years so

848
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,400
um I still get really good compliments

849
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,599
from everybody about my weed so I think

850
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,599
I'm on the right track and um basically

851
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,400
it's just a it's it's a line of

852
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:42,838
nutrients that I can be proud of because

853
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,400
you can pour it down the drain uh you

854
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:48,759
can inest it it's 100% safe and

855
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,800
non-toxic for all living things um it's

856
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,200
between 95 and 100% natural and organic

857
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,960
and that's there's a line of products so

858
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:58,399
um some of them we need to leave a

859
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,639
little bit of room for uh minerals to

860
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,160
make sure that it was strong and

861
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:04,719
performed properly um but I have a

862
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:07,559
personal belief that if everything in

863
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,399
the world was made from less than 5%

864
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,880
chemicals I don't think we would have

865
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:15,400
any big uproar about the overuse misuse

866
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,480
or abuse of chemicals so um yeah it

867
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,800
creates extremely clean medicine and one

868
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,920
of our uh biggest claim to fames other

869
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,880
than uh tpine profiles that are uh

870
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,880
certain Labs have said they've found a

871
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,000
higher number of profile uh Tarpin than

872
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,440
they've ever found and any other samples

873
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,079
is the heavy metal

874
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,720
count um our most recent testing uh we

875
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,960
did some heavy metal testing and sent it

876
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:40,318
to uh a Laboratories that have done

877
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,318
thousands of cannabis tests and

878
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:44,679
initially they got zeros everything came

879
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:47,119
back zeros and of course they said you

880
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:48,759
know there's no such thing as zero you

881
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,119
can't have any Trace amount of heavy

882
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,760
metals it's present in water peaches so

883
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:55,599
they actually recalibrated the machines

884
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,800
to from parts per million to parts per

885
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,440
billion and they found that our produce

886
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:04,400
R ranked from between 300 to 600 parts

887
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,800
per billion of the heavy metals arsenic

888
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,838
cadmium Mercury and lead and to me

889
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,400
that's virtually undetectable if you

890
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,400
have to recalibrate your machines that

891
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,079
are not used for anything else um and

892
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,079
you can have up to uh 100 parts per

893
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,920
million in an organic

894
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:23,720
Peach um I think that we're creating

895
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,720
really pure medicine and I think that

896
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:29,759
that's really important it may it it may

897
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:32,519
not be matter at all to the average user

898
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,079
but to the portion of the population who

899
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:38,159
actually have uh imuno efficiency

900
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:42,000
diseases or autism which is believed to

901
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:44,318
be linked to heavy metals um or Crohn's

902
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,920
disease or any kinds of diseases where

903
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:48,599
the slightest bit of contaminants can

904
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,280
really ruin your day I've had people

905
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:53,880
come to me and just say my migraines

906
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,640
every I've gone all over LA and and gone

907
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,519
to dozens of dispensaries and until I

908
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:59,799
found veganic medicine I couldn't smoke

909
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,838
weed without having a migraine and this

910
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,920
person is extremely hyper sensitive and

911
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:07,519
not not of the normal but so I I like to

912
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,200
say if you're going to call it medicine

913
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,440
you better make sure it's actually good

914
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,439
for

915
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,839
you so before we turn over to the the

916
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,639
floor to questions I'm going to ask each

917
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:20,799
of you if there's anything else you'd

918
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:22,920
like to talk about the future of

919
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,400
cannabis cultivation start with you

920
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,880
David is there anything that you want to

921
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:31,119
add to our conversation um I think I

922
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,720
covered as much as I remembered so I

923
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,358
think I'm good I I'll wait for questions

924
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:39,439
let's hear from David he's doing a great

925
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:42,199
job thank you thank you C Frenchie

926
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,720
anything you want to add before we

927
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:46,719
we I could add a lot it's

928
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:52,440
always we'll get your microphone working

929
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:54,358
before the end I promise him and Donald

930
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,200
Trump yeah something's wrong with

931
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:57,400
Frenchie's microphone they were Donald

932
00:41:56,199 --> 00:42:01,318
Trump was saying his microphone phon

933
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:04,200
didn't work sorry it it's like it's what

934
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:06,838
the type of quality Cal is talking it's

935
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:10,199
the type of quality I need to be able to

936
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:14,358
work and to be able to receive that I

937
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:18,719
need to be able to protect my grower and

938
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:21,239
if I really if we really work together

939
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,759
it's a long way because even the wine

940
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:26,719
industry didn't want to tackle

941
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,800
appellation control appellation control

942
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:30,318
give you

943
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,318
a lot

944
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:40,000
of not lot of space everything has to to

945
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:43,480
be local it's very strent reg regulation

946
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:48,880
and it's literally what we actually need

947
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:51,679
and we are stepping into history but we

948
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:56,280
don't even know what we have to offer

949
00:42:51,679 --> 00:43:00,480
the world there is most of the genetic

950
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:03,880
that is up North is not known by

951
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,079
99% of the people here in California and

952
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:11,559
even less in the world there is a

953
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:14,440
treasure D Trove to discover and use as

954
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:16,880
a a standard of quality for the rest of

955
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,920
the planet there is no way that you can

956
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:23,760
bring any strain and tell everybody that

957
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,880
that strain is so miraculous when there

958
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,319
is no standard to compare to and this is

959
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,680
a something that is massively important

960
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:35,920
for us to do because everybody is

961
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:38,598
looking at us in California and at the

962
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,519
US in general and we have really

963
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:45,400
everything to uh to create it here in

964
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:50,880
the South we you don't really have that

965
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:55,119
relation with a with a grower I have

966
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:59,838
but and being a French also give me that

967
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:03,680
step back of the of the world situation

968
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:07,159
you are really at a time in a history

969
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:11,078
where not only cannabis will change the

970
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:14,679
face of medicine but to create the

971
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:17,480
standard in one industry and it's a

972
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:18,440
professional of that industry that set

973
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,400
the

974
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,880
standard it does it has never happen in

975
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,039
in any industry but the

976
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:32,680
wine so it would be really important for

977
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:35,599
us to start working on this before we

978
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:38,919
start thinking about making money

979
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,838
because we don't even know exactly what

980
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:45,800
treasure TR and how much we have in our

981
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,799
