age and uh allows people to cultivate up

41
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:56,399
to six plants it creates a state

42
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:59,078
Regulatory and Licensing system that is

43
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,239
in the works right now and it allows

44
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:02,559
local government s to prohibit or

45
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:07,039

license commercial retail sales and uh

47
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,840
actually encourages them to do that

50
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:21,759

52
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,000
marijuana

53
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:29,919
regulation under taxation as you know

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,959
you can um have license fees but in

55
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,000
order to do a sales tax you would have

56
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,199
to have a ballot initiative and the

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,360
earliest to could do that is in

58
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:42,359
2019 uh it allows local regulation to

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,360
prohibit or regulate non-medical

60
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,159
marijuana and then personal cultivation

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,840

62
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:53,560
allowed and um that can be done indoors

63
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:57,080
but uh outdoor regulation can be

64
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:01,039

65
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,280
indoor cultivation by commercial Growers

66
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,959

75
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,639
there's no smoking in a public place

76
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,400

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:57,039
employers may also maintain a drug free

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,799
workplace again uh cities May regulate

83
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,840
or reasonably regulate the indoor

84
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,400

85
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,519
do it on a greenhouse or other

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,959
structures and local governments May

87
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:12,158
regulate or prohibit outdoor

88
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,079
cultivation what are reasonable

89
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:18,439
reasonable regulations you can require a

90
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,120
cultivation permit that requires uh the

91
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:23,918
city the the permit holder to allow the

92
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,800
city to come in and inspect to make sure

93
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:31,240
you have a six plant limit uh you're not

94
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,879
drawing from the electrical power grip

95
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,120
uh or presenting a health hazard or

96
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:40,240
using more water than is reasonable also

97
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,800
you can enforce the building and fire

98
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,918
codes um cities May regulate or prohibit

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,079
marijuana but you cannot prohibit the

100
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:52,159
transport on public roads so if someone

101
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,800
wanted to transport marijuana through

102
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,320
the city on a public road have to you

103
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,800
have to allow that uh the state

104
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,279
standards are minimum standards the city

105
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,199
can regulate much stricter than the

106
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,519
state

107
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,960
can now under a commercial operations

108
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:14,159
also the city

109
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,680
uh does not is not required to enact a

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,600
regulatory scream however again the

111
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,038
state will begin issuing licenses in on

112
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,600
January 1st

113
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:27,839
2018 and the city can place prohibitions

114
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,600
on uh and

115
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,799
regulate commercial marij

116
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,600
now there are again as John mentioned uh

117
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,199
we want you to look at some local policy

118
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,439
issues about what the city how the city

119
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,520
wants to regulate or prohibit certain

120
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:47,560
parts of this marijuana

121
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,318
proposition and uh the first one is do

122
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,199
you want to enact regulations for

123
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,319
non-medical marijuana

124
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,080
businesses also do you want to require

125
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:01,080
retails retailers to um enforce

126
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,918
eligibility of medical marijuana

127
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:06,279
cards which would enforce a sales tax

128
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,879
exemption and also do you want to impose

129
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:12,198
local taxes on

130
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:15,680
marijuana also uh moving on should the

131
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:20,120
city allow existing medical marijuana

132
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,959
collectives to also sell non-medical

133
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,280
marijuana that would limit it to the

134
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:29,638
sell the four existing collectives that

135
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,918
are already in West Hollywood Al and

136
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,879
next two bullet points just talk about

137
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,680
do you want to reeval evaluate the

138
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:39,719
licensing requirements for dispensing of

139
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,400
medical and non-medical

140
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,639
marijuana then moving on should the city

141
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,560
limit the number or location of

142
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,280
marijuana retail

143
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,360
stores and then getting to the taxation

144
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:55,878
issue again should the city tie approval

145
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:59,879
of any retail sales of marijuana to the

146
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:02,280
passage of a related sales tax bot

147
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:06,120
initiative which could the earliest you

148
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,399
can do that is 2019 so have to wait till

149
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,160
that

150
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:15,239
time uh also prohibit smoking or use of

151
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,199
marijuana can P public property again

152
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,038
prohibit The Possession and smoking of

153
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,520
marijuana in any public place do you

154
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,959
want to allow the manufacture extraction

155
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:27,399
testing or processing of marijuana

156
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,159
plants or products and also warehousing

157
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:32,638
is another thing to consider should that

158
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,639
beow out or

159
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,319
regulated then again uh should the city

160
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,439
impose uh

161
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,039
indoor uh cultivation regulations that

162
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,839
are reasonable and to the city allow

163
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,839
outdoor

164
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:50,359
cultivation now the next steps towards

165
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,560
non-medical marijuana regulation we

166
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,080
propose uh holding a series of community

167
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,879
meetings this month and next month

168
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,680
coming back to the council for further

169
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,080
Direction

170
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,639
in late summer of this year in the fall

171
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:10,120
we'd go to the Planning Commission and

172
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,439
review a draft marijana ordinance and

173
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,038
then bring that ordinance to the city

174
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:19,319
council for approval in the fall or

175
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:20,639
winter and uh thank you and we're open

176
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,199
for questions

177
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,079
on regulating

178
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,759
marijuana thank you mayor I just I just

179
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,240
want to ask a question of Staff before

180
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,919
we get to speakers when we're talking

181
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,278
about regulating uh marijuana in this

182
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,958
area does it have to be tied to the land

183
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:38,320
does it have to be a land use issue or

184
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,879
can we tie it to a business license and

185
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,680
make it a business licensing issue

186
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:45,838
instead of a land use issue or can we do

187
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:48,120
both or can they preclude one

188
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,480
another I think typically it would

189
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,200
probably be both that's how we did um

190
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,600
medical marijuana there's a planning

191
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,160
it's allowed in the planning in the

192
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,800
zoning ordinance but then it's really

193
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,600
regulated through the business license

194
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:02,519
permit because the reason I ask is there

195
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,959
may be some operators that we want to

196
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,480
continue to work with and others who may

197
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,159
be a disaster for us that we don't want

198
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,720
to continue to be in business with them

199
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:13,439
so all right thank

200
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,480

00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,879
let me get this up because I have a

216
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,159
statement um from Jackie subc and a lot

217
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,639
of things have changed one of the things

218
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,360
I'd like to ask is if we could change

219
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,199
the name from marijuana to cannabis

220
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,759
which The BMC uh BCR did because

221
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,720
marijuana is a derogatory basically

222
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,360
Comon it has it's a slang word for

223
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,079
cannabis okay good evening mayor this is

224
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,680
from Jackie subc good evening mayor and

225
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:08,879
council members I am sorry that I'm

226
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,879
unable to attend this session tonight I

227
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,838
am certain that you all know how very

228
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,759
important this topic is to me and that

229
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,640
if I could be here I absolutely would

230
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,200
but unfortunately that is not the case

231
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,600
this evening and in the meantime I

232
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,720
prepared this statement in the interest

233
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,560
of creating Fair Equitable and inclusive

234
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,480
cannabis policy for West Hollywood

235
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:27,239
Community I'd like to reference two

236
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,000
major things that just happened in the

237
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,000
state one the governor recently proposed

238
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,320
a trailer bill as part of the state

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,799
budget to serve as reconciliation

240
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,959
between medical and adult use regulation

241
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,719
and two the state agencies responsible

242
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,679
for cannabis including the Bureau of

243
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,440
marijuana control and cannabis control

244
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,799
issued the first draft of the

245
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,120
regulations this past Friday

246
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,599
unfortunately these two sets of proposed

247
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,240
regulations do not line up the way we

248
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,240
believe they should be so it's going to

249
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,240
take a little time to get this all

250
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,039
sorted out I'd like to make note that

251
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,720
some of the information contained in

252
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,759
your staff reports has already changed

253
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,959
and will likely change again after the

254
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:10,439
45-day public comment period is complete

255
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,278
one simple example of this is the

256
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,200
question of should the city allow

257
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:16,519
medical and adult use cannabis to be

258
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,879
sold in the same place depending on how

259
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:22,519
this all goes down at the state that may

260
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:24,320
not be allowed anymore I believe thank

261
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:28,278
thank you

262
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,519
Hal Wesley Bridal okay can he finish

263
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:33,838
statement excuse me how can you finish

264
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,120
that statement yes thank you I I I

265
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,279
appreciate it I'm sorry I'm not that

266
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,720
fast

267
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:42,078
um okay not be able to be sold in the

268
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,800
state yeah not to be able to so sold in

269
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,919
the state I believe it is really

270
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,399
important at this juncture to not limit

271
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,159
the amount of licenses in any category

272
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,839
especially for dispensaries although I

273
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:56,078
urge you to continue this conversation I

274
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,480
also encourage you to hold off on making

275
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,838
any financial decisions because at this

276
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,399
point many of these proposed regulations

277
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,200
could still change as it relates to

278
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,039
State Licensing and could have a direct

279
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,079
impact on the existing cannabis

280
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:13,000
businesses already established in the

281
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:15,039
city finally I just want to impress one

282
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,958
other point upon you that involves

283
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,679
public consumption we all realize that

284
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,000
this is a safety issue and one that

285
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,519
really affects law enforcement Food For

286
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,320
Thought rather than ban it and force

287
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,078
people out on the streets to legally

288
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,320
consume which is exactly what will

289
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,919
happen issue on-site consumption

290
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,800
licenses to any and all retail

291
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,479
establishments in the city that

292
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:38,159
requested as long as they are compliant

293
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,920
with the city and state laws there

294
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,958
should be no problem and it will

295
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,719
immediately alleviate any public safety

296
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,278
concerns thank you so much for your time

297
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,440
I look forward to continuing this

298
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,480

304

you City staff uh people say West

305
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,560
Hollywood is an lbgt City and I agree

306
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,199
the city is supportive and

307
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,759
representative of the lbgt community but

308
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:11,799
I would take it a step further and say

309
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,919
that West

310
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:18,039
Hollywood uh is a city activists our

311
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,198
city has activists in every shape shade

312
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:22,319
and gender

313
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:24,439
identity uh we have a big tent of

314
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,560
advocation that includes cannabis

315
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,880
activists it has been said that West

316
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,559
Hollywood is a creative City but when I

317
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,600
look look at the staff report I don't

318
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:36,759
see our Hallmark creativity I see more

319
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,680
of the same Alma has uh provided for the

320
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:41,399
adult use of cannabis and has given us

321
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:43,599
the opportunity opportunity to show our

322
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,799
fellow Californians how a city at the

323
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,920
Forefront can be a welcoming to a

324
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:50,359
burgeoning news sector of our

325
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,039
economy uh yet the staff report doesn't

326
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,480
mention any of the new businesses that

327
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,599
are allowed under prop 64 it speaks

328
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,120
nothing of on-site use locations like

329
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,000
coffee shops in Amsterdam nor does it

330
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,039
talk of other cannabis businesses who

331
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,559
operate in upscale Health and Beauty

332
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:08,719
sectors new economies need new ways of

333
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,879
thinking and to change our Norms here in

334
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,759
our city we have sex shops and loud and

335
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,360
proud bars that might be shut down if

336
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,399
they had to operate under the same

337
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,039
legislation that we subject our cannabis

338
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,480
disp to not to mention that our local

339
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,360
laws have left us with a list of people

340
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,920
who want to open cannabis dispensaries

341
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,800
30 plus long While others mysteriously

342
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,319
transfer ownership and

343
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:32,078
management uh only one of the four

344
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,000
dispensaries still operates under the

345
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,239
original owner now I don't want West

346
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,480
Hollywood to go to pot I don't Envision

347
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,278
a radically different West Hollywood I

348
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,120
Envision the same city that we know and

349
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,240
love where we take a stand against

350
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,759
oppression and imp Implement Creative

351
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,839
Solutions to build towards a more

352
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,680
inclusive Society so in a time when 45

353
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,839
appointed attorney general Jeff's

354
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,120
sessions says good people don't smoke

355
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,320
marijuana it is my hope that West

356
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,198
Hollywood is a town that says we welcome

357
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,800
the Cannabis cult culture and our town

358
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:03,758
will continue to be a tourist

359
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,559
destination location for all oppressed

half of our team lives here in West

367
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:22,559
Hollywood um we hope that the city

368
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,680
eventually adopts a rigorous application

369
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,198
process for folks that are hoping to get

370
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,159
uh a license uh we're local but we've

371
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,958
worked in a number of states uh worked

372
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,120
with Regulators in Arizona and Illinois

373
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,758
and Massachusetts and seeing how it's

374
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,759
gone down in a lot of these different

375
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,440
jurisdictions uh the more involved

376
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,240
legislators are the better The Operators

377
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,480
end up being a number of states have

378
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,039
tried to uh some places have gone with

379
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,120
the lottery system and not tried to uh

380
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,799
do a qualitative review and it's just

381
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,879
ended up uh um leading to subpar

382
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:56,198
operators and and and um uh the types of

383
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:58,679
dispensaries that that that are less

384
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:00,039
desirable that that we've all seen um

385
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,239
let's H would have supported some of the

386
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:04,439
medical dispensaries here in town uh

387
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,240
it's led to some of them being the the

388
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,880
the the leaders in the State uh without

389
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,240
local support dispensaries have a hard

390
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,078
time operating the way they could and

391
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,278
the way they should now that prop 64 is

392
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,399
passed um and the industry has

393
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:18,679
widespread support the city of West

394
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,000
Hollywood has an opportunity to raise

395
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:24,559
the bar and to remain a leader um and uh

396
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,399
to continue to inspire cities and folks

397
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,838
like the Icelandic folks that were

398
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,919
mentioned earlier that are so excited

399
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,000
about West Hollywood and I think that uh

400
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,958
you know there are a number of us that

401
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,919
look forward to making you very proud so

402
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,439
thank you thank you Aaron Amanda hi to

403
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:41,599
be followed by cat

404
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,880
Packer hello Council I've lost my voice

405
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,040
so you will have to excuse how Kathleen

406
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:50,679
Turner I

407
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:54,039
sound um we have been a leader in the

408
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:58,120
Cannabis world and so we've set a tone

409
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:59,599
for that world and people look to us for

410
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,679
our policies

411
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,759
and we are in a rare position of having

412
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:12,198
the infrastructure the means and the

413
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:15,038
social programs to um curate and create

414
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,839
the Cannabis experience that we want

415
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,679
whereas in other cities where they don't

416
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:20,438
have the means and the money they're

417
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:23,319
going to take in everything because they

418
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,480
want that money coming in um to do

419
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:27,519
things like Phill pot holes and such so

420
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,400
we're in this rare opportunity where we

421
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,200
aren't beholden to like

422
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,120
the same thing as they are um and so I

423
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,000
think rather than taking a pause and

424
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,239
watching what everyone else does we need

425
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,359
to be creative as like we like to say

426
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,759
all the time and actually be leaders

427
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:47,678
rather than followers um also I think

428
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,720
the current I think leaving things the

429
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,640
same is not creative at all I'm

430
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,519
personally not happy what things are

431
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,038
who's to say that the things the

432
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,720
businesses that we have right now are

433
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,200
the best of the best if it was an open

434
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,679
market that was inclusive would those

435
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,600
businesses last because I know that West

436
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,280
Hollywood's business experience you kind

437
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,199
of have to be the best of the best in

438
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,720
any form of business in order to survive

439
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,200
here we really curate original unique

440
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,600
amazing experiences as businesses and I

441
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,159
don't understand why we wouldn't do that

442
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,879
the same when it comes to this as a

443
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,320
business and we wouldn't take in that

444
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,880
taxation so that we could keep on having

445
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:25,000
the social services that we have I just

446
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,000
see it as a um missed opportunity I

447
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,159
think we really need to reach out into

448
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,279
our community because I think we have a

449
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,679
very amazing um demographic of people

450
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,759
that are successful in business and

451
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,679
successful in ways and we should really

452
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,960
I like that we're going to have

453
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:39,038
Community meetings but we really need to

454
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,720
make sure that the community knows

455
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,519
they're going to be happening because I

456
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,600
go to all this and I have a hard time

457
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:47,480
finding out what's happening but thank

458
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:50,279
you so much thank you Amanda cat Packer

459
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,038
to be followed by William mcney hello

460
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,558
again to city council my name is cat

461
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:55,480
Packer and I'm a policy coordinator with

462
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:57,480
an organization called the drug policy

463
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,960
Alliance uh through my work with the

464
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,000
drug policy Alliance I've been focused

465
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,200
uh very heavily on the implementation of

466
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,240
the adult use of marijuana act in its

467
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,840
reconciliation with the medical cannabis

468
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,599
and Regulation and safety act uh as how

469
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,639
Lewis had already said um just this past

470
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,839
Friday the Bureau of medical cannabis

471
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,320
regulation released uh its draft

472
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,439
regulations and a few weeks prior uh the

473
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,200
governor released his trailer Bill all

474
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,200
of that to say that there's a lot moving

475
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,080
around the state in terms of cannabis

476
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,038
policy and a lot is changing uh I've

477
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:31,599
been participating uh very heavily

478
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,798
Statewide and in particularly uh in Los

479
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,639
Angeles County and the city to have

480
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:39,119
conversations about how to make cannabis

481
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,640
policy uh more inclusive and more

482
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,279
Equitable and the reason why this is uh

483
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,480
particularly important uh and especially

484
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,440
here in California is that uh having a

485
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,200
cannabis license can be the very

486
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,798
difference between uh profit and a crime

487
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,400
and here in the state of California

488
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,720
low-income communities and uh

489
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,400
communities of color have been

490
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,240
specifically targeted

491
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,640
uh I don't necessarily know what the

492
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,679
demographics and arrest uh statistics

493
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,919
look like uh for the city of West

494
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,919
Hollywood but if they Trend uh similar

495
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,320
to the rest of California let me get

496
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,880
just give you one statistic uh in 2015

497
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:16,439
black people were two times more likely

498
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,360
to be arrested for a marijuana

499
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,919
misdemeanor and two times more likely to

500
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,038
be or and five times more likely to be

501
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:26,640
arrested for uh a marijuana felony and

502
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:28,879
this was in 2015 where we know that

503
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,440
folks could have just paid $40 and walk

504
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,799
into uh some place on on Venice Beach

505
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,080
and so as we're talking about uh jobs

506
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:37,558
and creating economic opportunities I

507
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,439
want to make sure that we are thinking

508
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:41,798
and being inclusive of those communities

509
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,519
that have been criminalized for the

510
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:48,599
exact same plant thank you thank you Cat

511

William mcney to be followed by Michael

512
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:54,480

mcney Bill um well good evening Council

514
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,839
and staff um I'm here to support uh the

515
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:02,519
fact of having having

516
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,879
recreational and have uh medical

517
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:07,119
marijuana uh I agree with a lot of the

518
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,720
uh State suggestions that I heard about

519
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:15,079
last Monday um saying that uh they he

520
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,400
the governor prefers that the uh medical

521
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:20,399
and recreational be sold at different

522
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:24,240
not on the same location or the same

523
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,080
space um I agree with that um I think

524
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,079
this would I reiterate what other people

525
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:31,319
said this is a creative City I know you

526
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,158
come up with a creative solution you did

527
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:34,759
with medical marijuana you were a leader

528
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:38,000
I see no reason why you're not going to

529
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:40,679
be in this instance also and I hope you

530

00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,880
Michael vich will be our last speaker

532
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,798
council members of the public good

533
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:52,120
evening again Michael

534
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:56,119
voage so another very easy breezy staff

535
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:58,879
report that centers on a complex topic

536
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:02,479
on a burgeoning industry that stamps

537
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,039
from a very potent

538
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,519
drug West

539
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:11,359
Hollywood has the greatest proportion of

540
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,798
people within the

541
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:18,319
county versus other

542
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:20,480
cities who receive housing assistance

543
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:25,558
with Federal

544
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:28,240
money and as anyone should know but most

545
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:32,038
people don't because staff chooses to

546
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,839
over look this the use of marijuana

547
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:38,359
medical or otherwise is

548
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:42,199
prohibited so you're talking prohibition

549
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:45,359
from residents who are either Section 8

550
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,519
Project based Section 8 anyone receiving

551
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:52,278
hwa funds in this

552
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:52,278
city doesn't take

553
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:59,000
responsibility to acknowledge this fact

554
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:03,400
and to say what is going to happen

555
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:07,079
should that person choose to believe

556
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,080
in proposition

557
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:14,158
64 and not be advised on what they're

558
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:17,319
willing to

559
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:21,278
risk it's always interesting to

560
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:24,319
hear the benefits of Taxation that will

561
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:29,440
come towards Social Services when in

562
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,439
many ways Social Services

563
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:38,798
is adversely affected by marijuana it

564
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:41,359
has an ill effect on those with mental

565
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:44,759
illness especially those who are

566
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:49,319
homeless so I just ask you to think

567
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:51,759
about this in some deeper terms and to

568
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:54,278
have the wherewithal and the

569
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,558
responsibility to advise your residents

570
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:59,119
what their rights are and are not thank

571
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:00,480
you thank you Michael

572
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,239
council member

573
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,319
Duran thank you mayor I have some more

574
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,000
follow-up questions now maybe for staff

575
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:10,000
and staff doesn't know maybe some of the

576
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,519
people in the audience May uh the far

577
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,200
roacher Amendment to the federal budget

578
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:19,558
would have prohibited uh the DEA uh from

579
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,120
using any funds to go after medicinal

580
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,798
marijuana and those states that have

581
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,798
medicinal marijuana was the far roacher

582
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:27,519
Amendment included in the budget that

583
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:30,359
the Congress just passed this week does

584
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:30,359
anybody

585
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,960
no we don't know anybody out there that

586
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:39,398
from drug policy Alliance know did

587
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,159
farbacher make it don't know okay all

588
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:43,000
right

589
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,080
so all right so the the reason I I ask

590
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,720
is uh because that's a question we're

591
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:50,278
going to have to deal with as we

592
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,519
continue to uh try to regulate in this

593
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:54,558
area this is actually a topic I know a

594
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:57,038
lot about it's ironic I know because I'm

595
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,960
sober and don't use alcohol or drugs but

596
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,679
I actually know a lot about uh this

597
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,840
particular issue because of the history

598
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,559
of the AIDS epidemic and the role that

599
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:08,199
medicinal marijuana played when we used

600
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:10,158
to have to uh argue in court of medical

601
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,240
necessity uh long before there was a

602
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,640
proposition 215 and long before there

603
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,919
was a proposition 64 I think that um the

604
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,480
biggest concern I have is the continuing

605
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,360
conflict between federal and state law

606
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,000
that's going to continue to exist and

607
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:30,240
how we attempt to navigate and regulate

608
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,880
in an area with um uh a federal attorney

609
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,720
general and government that could

610
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,880
potentially be hostile uh to the states

611
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,640
or localities on this issue I mean we we

612
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,640
know what happened when we the city

613
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,960
helped the Reverend Scott imler buy a

614
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,559
building here in the city of West

615
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,278
Hollywood for the Los Angeles cannabis

616
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:49,158
Resource Center back in

617
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:51,558
1996 and in the year 2001 the Bush

618
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:54,039
Administration seized that building the

619
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:55,960
city uh actually we were we forfeited

620
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:58,640
the building was taken under the drug

621
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,200
forfeiture laws from the city of West is

622
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,880
the one and only time that the United

623
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,080
States actually took an asset from your

624
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,559
municipality citing drug forfeiture laws

625
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,798
so what I know to be true is when the

626
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,558
federal government wants to play mean

627
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:15,839
and nasty they they will play mean and

628
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:18,000
nasty in this area um to me I I I think

629
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,639
the idea about Community meetings I I

630
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,919
don't think I support that and here's

631
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,559
the reason why I think it's always great

632
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:25,720
to get public opinion and public input

633
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:27,119
and there should be a place for that but

634
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,038
I think in the upcoming months we should

635
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:32,558
get some teams of experts rather than

636
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:35,158
just Community input uh people will have

637
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:37,000
a lot of opinions uh uh about this

638
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,320
particular issue what they won't have is

639
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,119
a lot of expertise and I think what's

640
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:44,119
going to be more helpful to us is to

641
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:46,959
have expertise on the issue of you know

642
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:49,119
what governor Brown uh is doing up in

643
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,440
Sacramento I heard Mr mcne say Governor

644
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,158
Brown is recommending that the medicinal

645
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,360
non-medicinal be in separate places I

646
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,480
thought I read in the LA Times the

647
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:58,038
governor wanted them merged together

648
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,798
that's correct right yeah the governor

649
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:02,919
actually wants them merge together uh

650
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,599
medicinal and non-medicinal in the same

651
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:07,159
place uh I think it's best we have some

652
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,678
expertise on that we're still going to

653
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:11,760
run a foul of the the banking issues

654
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,278
that exist that uh people who are

655
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,759
involved in uh marijuana whether it's

656
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:17,480
medicinal or adult use they still going

657
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,440
to have problems with banking systems

658
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,159
that will not allow them to bank because

659
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,960
it's a violation of federal law Mr V

660
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,120
levage brought up an issue that does

661
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,319
actually exist and at some point we will

662
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,319
have to educate uh our residents about

663
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:33,798
the fact that if you're caught smoking a

664
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:36,000
joint in federal HUD property you will

665
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:40,038
be evicted uh notwithstanding

666
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,640
proposition 64 or the uh easing of the

667
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:44,640
laws on U marijuana use in the state of

668
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,320
California because it's federally funded

669
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,399
building those are smaller issues I

670
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:53,720
think we we um the issue of cultivation

671
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:55,759
I think is problematic in West Hollywood

672
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,278
because we don't have a lot of uh real

673
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,960
estate we don't have a lot of G we're

674
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:03,319
too dense for cultivation I think trying

675
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,960
to get into the issue of regulating

676
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:07,639
cultivation in people's homes or

677
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,519
backyards is beyond the uh enforcement

678
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,278
resources that we have and we should

679
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,599
probably not not do that but I think

680
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:16,159
that we probably should prohibit

681
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,278
cultivation in the city because I don't

682
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,120
think we have enough geography or real

683
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:22,440
estate for that to happen we've also

684
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:23,518
received Communications from Edison that

685
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,600
they're not sure they'd be able to

686
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,440
supply the power uh that would be

687
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,798
necessary to to do that so I think

688
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,278
ultimately we're going to be involved in

689
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:34,000
the distribution issue I also want to

690
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:36,240
understand from the experts if

691
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,200
proposition 64 on the issue of

692
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,079
transportation and distribution delivery

693
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,960
services means that the health and

694
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,278
safety code sections that have to do

695
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,919
with transportation of controlled

696
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:48,119
substances are no longer going to be

697
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,559
enforced in the state courts

698
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:53,558
traditionally you cannot transport uh

699
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:55,599
Controlled Substances um and I just want

700
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:57,200
to make sure that whatever we're doing

701
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,079
here that we're not running a foul of

702
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,360
the criminal stat statutes on

703
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:02,359
transportation and distribution uh for

704
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:06,240
control

705
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:08,199
substances uh the uh the issue around

706
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,038
taxation I think the people of the city

707
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,640
of West Hollywood have voted repeatedly

708
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:14,319
to tax themselves on everything from

709
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,759
homelessness to Transit and I imagine

710
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,240
that there will be strong support in

711
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,919
fact we know from a recent Community

712
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,159
survey there's strong support for

713
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:23,240
taxation of marijuana in the city of

714
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,600
West Hollywood so I think we should move

715
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,399
forward at some point of getting that on

716
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:30,639
the 2019 ballot uh I just want to

717
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:32,599
understand then uh how we're going to

718
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,159
possibly uh get into the regulation

719
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:36,359
business before we tax them and making

720
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:38,640
sure that if we're going to then move

721
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:41,558
forward to taxation that we do it in a

722
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,440
way that's timely uh I'm open to the

723
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:47,839
suggestion of expanding beyond the four

724
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,600
existing uh uh collectives that exist I

725
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,519
don't know the number I don't know how

726
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:55,639
many uh I'm a little concerned about the

727
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:58,079
merger of medicinal marijuana with adult

728
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,759
use for the reason that I think the the

729
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,240
Trump Administration has given early

730
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,879
signals that they're going to leave

731
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:08,038
medicinal marijuana alone but they're

732
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,679
not as clear about adult use and um I

733
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:11,519
actually think the medical marijuana

734
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,000
collectives in the city would be have

735
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:17,759
far greater protection in their current

736
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,480
role as uh medicinal uh Distributors and

737
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,640
if we allow them to then expand into

738
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,679
adult use did we place them at risk uh a

739
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,038
federal prosecution uh should we be uh

740
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,798
making them aware of the risks that are

741
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,038
involved let them decided what risk

742
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:31,879
they're willing to take so I think that

743
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,879
you know

744
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,760
ultimately opinions uh from the

745
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,720
community are great but I think I need

746
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,079
we need some expertise to help guide us

747
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,200
through some of these policy decisions

748
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:45,639
uh on the issues of the conflict between

749
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,720
state federal and local regulation uh

750
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,440
how we are going to regulate uh through

751
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,240
Planning Commission or Business License

752
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,399
Commission or both uh in terms of uh the

753
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,120
operation whether we expand beyond the

754
00:30:54,398 --> 00:31:00,199
four uh I'm open to it uh and I'm I just

755
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:02,839
don't know what the number is uh and how

756
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,399
we would go about doing that I I do I

757
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:06,038
know that staff told me at one point

758
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,879
they were keeping a list of people who

759
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:11,158
are interested in doing this I I don't

760
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,240
think it should be a random draw and I

761
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,840
don't think it should be a who's ever

762
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,599
next on the list draw I think that we

763
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,959
should have some sort of process

764
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,359
involved that we can check the capital

765
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,919
that exists behind any of these

766
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:26,319
potential operations their level of

767
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,399
expertise uh on these uh these

768
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,278
particular issues uh uh background

769
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:33,959
checks I I'd rather have a little bit

770
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,079
more of a thorough vetting uh if we were

771
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,720
going to expand uh rather than just

772
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:41,480
going who's next in order or a random

773
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,120
draw through a lotto uh and how we do

774
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,200
that in a way that's fair and Equitable

775
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,678
when obviously there are a lot of people

776
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,840
who would like to get into this very

777
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:51,320
lucrative business potentially um that's

778
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:52,439
the what's got me scratching my head I

779
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:54,079
don't have the answer to that but I

780
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,399
think that's something we can look at as

781
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,158
we uh as we move forward on these issues

782
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,879
so I know we want to try to get this in

783
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,278
by the end of the year and we've

784
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,399
probably got a couple of stops the

785
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:04,079
Planning Commission and the Business

786
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,918
License Commission before it comes back

787
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,439
here but I think in the short term um

788
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:10,960
getting the right experts at a a meeting

789
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,440
a public meeting where the public can

790
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,278
provide their opinions is going to be

791
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,880
more important to me than just meeting

792
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:17,880
with the community thank

793
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:28,240
you mayor Pro 10 oh council member Deo

794
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:30,840
thank you mayor um I uh I really want to

795
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,759
thank everyone who uh number one took

796
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:36,558
the time to uh stay with us through the

797
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:41,119
previous part of this meeting to speak

798
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:42,759
now and um uh I continue to learn and

799
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,918
know there's a lot more learning to do

800
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,759
and so this kind of information delivery

801
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,559
which is pretty direct is very much

802
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:53,000
appreciated and certainly uh all of you

803
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:55,720
are welcome to contact my office

804
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,359
directly I'm meet with you uh sit down

805
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,240
and discuss at length as I have with

806
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:02,638
several different sets of people already

807
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,440
um and I'm willing to and want to talk

808
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:08,319
with all of you as well because I think

809
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,440
um uh the recurring theme that I agree

810
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:15,599
with the most um and it's really a sort

811
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,480
of three-part theme one is that uh we

812
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:20,398
have to we have an opportunity to do

813
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,720
this in a really extraordinary way and

814
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,398
um the

815
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,480
four uh dispensaries that we have I

816
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:29,558
don't think are ready to sort of operate

817
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,440
uh in prime time yet I think they serve

818
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:36,398
the medical use Community quite well uh

819
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:39,720
exquisitly in fact um but I think uh I

820
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:42,918
can imagine a $400 a night tourist on

821
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:46,558
the Sunset Strip uh having a certain

822
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:50,000
experience and uh someone shopping on

823
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:53,158
Melrose having a different experience um

824
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,759
someone on the east side uh having yet a

825
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,080
third experience and none of those

826
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,398
experiences are captured by our current

827
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:02,439
series and

828
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:04,518
um maybe that's three of uh uh three of

829
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:09,159
three experiences or maybe that's three

830
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:13,358
of 25 experiences but I think the market

831
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:18,079
um will give us some hints uh pretty

832
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:21,319
quickly and uh so I'm I'm interested in

833
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:24,079
in that I I

834
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,838
uh I'm also interested in figuring out

835
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:30,560
how we can coordinate this effort with a

836
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:33,000
tax uh uh with a tax and I guess one of

837
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:36,320
the questions I have for staff is can we

838
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,199
issue uh business licenses that

839
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,838
would

840
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:42,799
uh uh expire if the city does not adopt

841
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:47,320
a

842
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,960
tax um so on January 1st 2018 you don't

843
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,760
have to answer now but I think this is a

844
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,960
question we want to I would like to get

845
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,679
answered on January 1st 2018 businesses

846
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,240
can go into business but if the city

847
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:02,680
does not adopt the tax on March whatever

848
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:04,039
it is 5th 2019 those business licenses

849
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:08,239
would expire and they would have to

850
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:10,400
close in 60 days or some something uh

851
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:15,159
during which time we could make a

852
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,519
different decision but I think uh uh for

853
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:19,639
me I'm not willing to have us wait until

854
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:23,960
March of 19 to open

855
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:25,358
dispensaries um I think that's uh you

856
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,679
know maybe we don't need to be in a

857
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:30,279
hurry but I just think that that does

858
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:36,078
doesn't really put us in uh the cat bird

859
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:39,760
seat as it were um I I also uh think we

860
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:46,320
should have a a fairly lenient policy

861
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:48,079
about uh on-site use um I I uh this is

862
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,640
now a legal product in the state of

863
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:54,359
California and telling people that they

864
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:56,799
can only um buy it and squirrel

865
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:59,000
themselves back to their house to use it

866
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,160
um I can't actually think of another

867
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,719
product uh that we treat in that way I

868
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:07,239
mean certainly there are products that

869
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:13,598
are maybe best used in private locations

870
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:17,358
but uh I just think um in some way

871
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,800
uh we should

872
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,719
um we should not just allow for that

873
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,160
opportunity but we should we should

874
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:26,279
carefully figure out how that

875
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:29,399
opportunity is the best version for our

876
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,800
city and uh uh what are the parking

877
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,358
requirements for it and all kinds of

878
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:38,839
things uh because um

879
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:40,920
uh because this is the world that that

880
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:44,279
we're in and our state voted for it and

881
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,760
I think um I for one understand why it

882
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,599
passed and I think that our city can

883
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,079
provide a a fairly Exquisite experience

884
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:54,318
around the entire the entire the entire

885
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:58,039
experience and um

886
00:36:54,318 --> 00:37:00,079
uh finally I want to return to something

887
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:03,199
Michael voich said and I think council

888
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,200
member Duran followed up on um yes we

889
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,519
have a we have a federal

890
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:11,480
government uh

891
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:13,719
it's we we all know this it's 3500 miles

892
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:17,159
away and sometimes it's in our bedrooms

893
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:21,759
so uh we have

894
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:24,039
to be sure and careful that as a city

895
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:29,640
we're delivering all the information

896
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:33,639
we're telling you how um how this works

897
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:36,519
uh and how it doesn't work and where uh

898
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:40,239
where some of the traps uh and pitfalls

899
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:42,440
and danger zones may be um because as

900
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,759
council member Duran said we can't

901
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,480
necessarily protect you from the long

902
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,119
arm of the federal government um

903
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,119
especially if

904
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:56,240
they were to choose West Hollywood as a

905
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:58,519
location to make a point so um I think I

906
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:01,039
think that's an important an important

907
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:03,639
piece that we can't leave behind the

908
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:06,358
education uh of what our federal

909
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:10,318
government thinks of what it is we're

910
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:12,078
we're doing um and I have one last

911
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:14,559
question that I also don't need an

912
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,280
answer to tonight but um I'm just

913
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:21,039
wondering if uh if it's possible to set

914
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:24,200
a minimum fee for a business license or

915
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:27,559
have an auction as a way to raise

916
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:32,879
revenue for uh the city's implementation

917
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:35,199
of this um or if uh or if merely setting

918
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,318
the business license cost is the only

919
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,838
way to to uh engage with with possible

920
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:44,318
vendors

921
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:48,599
um and I think that's uh all the things

922
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:50,000
that I wanted to bring up uh so far

923
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,880
thank

924
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,880
you council member horbath thank you

925
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,358
mayor um I want to thank the members of

926
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:02,318
the public who came out to speak as well

927
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:05,799
um I think that this we're in um mostly

928
00:39:02,318 --> 00:39:07,960
Uncharted Territory although uh we've

929
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,920
been at the Forefront of the piece that

930
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,800
isn't Uncharted Territory and I hope

931
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,680
that we stay there moving forward um I

932
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,119
think there are certainly a lot of

933
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:20,399
considerations I think um as I

934
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,800
understand it staff is asking for

935
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,400
direction from city council um on where

936
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,000
we want to go next but there really

937
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,280
aren't recommendations

938
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,880
from staff based on what sort of options

939
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:39,400
there are so um I wish we had some more

940
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,280
information from you about um what you

941
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,160
know what some of the consequences of

942
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,680
some of those choices might be I agree

943
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:47,960
with council member Duran that um we're

944
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:50,199
going to get the best information from

945
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,358
folks who are stakeholders in this

946
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:55,960
industry and who have some degree of

947
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:58,480
expertise so I think working with them

948
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,000
first to make sure that we're

949
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,559
understanding you know from folks who

950
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
are doing this and are aware of you know

951
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,000
the latest and greatest in terms of

952
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,760
Regulation but also in terms of um you

953
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,358
know what sort of businesses are out

954
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,920
there um I'm certainly open I think um

955
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:16,358
I'm certainly open to expanding the

956
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,240
number of licenses and the kinds of

957
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:23,639
businesses that we have here um I think

958
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:27,039
that retail is very a retail um shop

959
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,118
that sells a topical um is much

960
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,679
different

961
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:34,680
than um a a cannabis bar that would be a

962
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:36,399
place for on-site consumption so

963
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:38,759
regulating those two things would be

964
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,119
very different for me one feels like a

965
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:47,599
Cosmetics place and one feels like um a

966
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:50,920
bar and so um I think uh the question of

967
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,240
medical versus adult use um is one that

968
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,599
we've heard brought to us from the

969
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:59,799
community there are concerns about

970
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,800
access of um IAL cannabis um as opposed

971
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,720
to you know those who are um

972
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,640
participating in the new regulation

973
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:10,000
under 64 so I think um making sure that

974
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:12,358
we are creating and continuing to

975
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,159
protect safe access for patients is

976
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:16,559
important um and also uh equally

977
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:19,239
important is making sure that we're

978
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:22,719
keeping um cannabis out of the hands of

979
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:24,838
underage non-patients um so um separate

980
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,480
facilities I understand there's a debate

981
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,480
about where the governor at on that and

982
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,039
where we're going to go but I think that

983
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,000
when you keep the facilities separate um

984
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:36,960
you avoid issues like that um although

985
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,519
without necessarily understanding from a

986
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,199
you know informed point of view what the

987
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,920
consequences of separating them might be

988
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:46,679
for that same issue um so I would like

989
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,800
some more information on that um I think

990
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:51,879
you've addressed um you've raised the

991
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,760
issue of uh whether there would be um

992
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:57,240
consumption in public spaces and for me

993
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,800
this feel that issue feels a lot like SM

994
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:00,759
smoking or drinking smoking cigarettes

995
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,318
or drinking in public so I don't agree

996
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,680
with the comments that were made about

997
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:07,599
we're just going to shove people out in

998
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,879
the streets um no we're not um but I

999
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,960
think that we have to figure out what

1000
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,838
the right spaces are where people can

1001
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:17,119
consume um cannabis and in what Manner

1002
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:19,119
um I I understand there's been

1003
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,680
discussion at least brought to the

1004
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,000
Planning Commission about um delivery

1005
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,159
services and I don't know how we

1006
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
regulate other types of delivery Ser

1007
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,118
services at this point in the city

1008
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
anyway so do we

1009
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:36,640
regulate um pharmaceutical deliveries do

1010
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,318
we regulate wine deliveries do we

1011
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:42,759
regulate what kind of deliveries do we

1012
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:44,639
regulate if any and um you know so uh

1013
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,599
again echoing council member deo's

1014
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,920
comments since this is a legal substance

1015
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:51,039
what are some of the things that we can

1016
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,920
be comparing it to and comparable uses

1017
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:57,480
um that uh that would make sense in

1018
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,079
terms of Regulation um I think are

1019
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,199
certainly a number of Public Safety

1020
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:05,160
questions we need to um to ask there are

1021
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:06,919
questions I know some of my colleagues

1022
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:10,759
and other communities have been raising

1023
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:12,200
the issue of um what amount of I I don't

1024
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,599
know what the right language around this

1025
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:17,399
is but uh what amount of consumption

1026
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:19,200
what would a DUI litmus test or

1027
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,200
percentage be I don't even know if

1028
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,919
that's possible I don't know Sciences

1029
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:26,279
behind that at this point but um but I

1030
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,519
also know that um another public safety

1031
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,760
issue is Banking and making sure that

1032
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,199
we're not uh that whatever businesses do

1033
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,079
come to West Hollywood that we're

1034
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:36,679
helping them figure out what Financial

1035
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:39,599
mechanisms they're using to make sure

1036
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:41,759
these businesses don't become targets of

1037
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,720
um some of the crimes of opportunity

1038
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:48,400
that we've seen happening in the city um

1039
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:49,719
from time to time so I think there are

1040
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,838
as much as I would like to provide

1041
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:53,919
Direction I feel like that's almost

1042
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,159
about as specific as I can be given that

1043
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,358
we don't have a lot of information to

1044
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:01,399
start from I agree that I'd like to

1045
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:03,199
start with um expert expert opinion and

1046
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,318
bringing that information into the

1047
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:08,799
conversation um before we go to the

1048
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:11,599
public um I think uh we have to have an

1049
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,880
informed policy to be considered by the

1050
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,318
public um not sort of the other way

1051
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,599
around and I'll see if I have anything

1052
00:44:17,318 --> 00:44:22,920
to add after uh as we're moving towards

1053
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:26,280
a motion thanks okay thank you mayor

1054
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:30,480
pm thank you and thank you to all the

1055
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:34,440
people who came out to speak tonight um

1056
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:37,719
I don't use marijuana I don't drink um

1057
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,280
have a a lot of history of substance

1058
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:43,558
abuse in my family so that's a choice

1059
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:47,720
I've made uh the voters have made a

1060
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:50,920
choice in California to allow for uh

1061
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:53,078
adult use of marijuana uh it's something

1062
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:56,838
that I think the voters in West

1063
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:59,880
Hollywood support it pretty uh heavily

1064
00:44:56,838 --> 00:45:03,440
uh and I think we've had as a city a

1065
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:06,640
history of supporting certainly medical

1066
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,200
use of marijuana uh the voters have

1067
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:13,118
decided that uh medical um adult use

1068
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:16,439
marijuana is something that is permitted

1069
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,400
now in the state of California and I

1070
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:22,358
think that we should as a city embrace

1071
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,480
it in the same way that we embraced the

1072
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:27,078
use of medical

1073
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,318
marijuana we are not really in the

1074
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:30,960
business of opening up one of these

1075
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:35,000
establishments

1076
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:39,000
um the people who want to do that are of

1077
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:42,280
course risking the federal law being

1078
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,480
enforced against them they have to work

1079
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,839
out their own relationships with

1080
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:51,280
landlords uh and the risk that's

1081
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:54,519
entailed there they have to work out

1082
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,960
their banking relationships that is not

1083
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:59,440
something that is the city's respons

1084
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,599
possibility we're not opening up one of

1085
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:06,559
these establishments we're here in a

1086
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:09,200
regulatory capacity and so I think that

1087
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:12,359
we need to figure out what kind of

1088
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:16,000
regulations are appropriate given that

1089
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:18,440
this is the reality uh you put in here

1090
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,800
one of the possible actions would be for

1091
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:27,280
us to uh ban the uh operation of adult

1092
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,519
use marijuana facilities in or can

1093
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,359
facilities in West Hollywood and I think

1094
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,559
that was put in there kind of

1095
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,799
rhetorically because I don't think

1096
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:39,200
that's where the city is going to go and

1097
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:42,400
certainly not where I think we should go

1098
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:45,558
you asked us a series of questions and

1099
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,240
I'm going to go through them um in order

1100
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:50,160
of the questions you've asked and I

1101
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:54,479
understand it's difficult for us to

1102
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,480
answer them because as Lindsay

1103
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,480
said as Lindsay said we don't have

1104
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:01,720
complete

1105
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,679
information um the first one is should

1106
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:05,439
the city allow the existing medical

1107
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:09,078
marijuana collectives to sell

1108
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,240
non-medical marijuana that sounds like a

1109
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:14,720
question that we can't really answer

1110
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:17,318
because that may be decided by the state

1111
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:20,519
so perhaps that's an issue that needs to

1112
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:23,358
be deferred should we limit non-medical

1113
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:26,000
marijuana to locations where there are

1114
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:28,279
currently licensed medical marijuana

1115
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,079
dispensaries I don't think that's the

1116
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:35,079
appropriate response um as my colleagues

1117
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:39,200
have indicated if they're combined maybe

1118
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:41,880
they're not the the best people to

1119
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:44,000
operate those facilities they may be but

1120
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,720
I don't know that we necessarily want to

1121
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,318
limit to four locations for any other

1122
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:54,639
business coffee shops you know the ones

1123
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:58,519
that sell coffee um

1124
00:47:54,639 --> 00:48:00,358
we we allow the market to dictate right

1125
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:02,599
people can open up the business if they

1126
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:04,639
get their license and then the

1127
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:06,880
marketplace determines who's successful

1128
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:08,960
and who isn't but I think this is

1129
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,720
different and I think that we do need to

1130
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,880
be more cautious about this um and I do

1131
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:17,799
think that we need to have some kind of

1132
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,280
limit on locations as you already

1133
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,240
indicated we probably need to keep them

1134
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,079
away from schools we need to keep them

1135
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:26,959
away and that's what state law already

1136
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:30,280
contemplated the initiative already

1137
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:33,838
contemplated that um I like my colleague

1138
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:36,519
suggestion council member deos about if

1139
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:39,838
we go ahead with licensing and

1140
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:45,119
regulation um having those regulations

1141
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:47,719
tied into or terminate once we you know

1142
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:51,880
have a sales tax uh if we don't have a

1143
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:55,279
tax then the um permissions or the

1144
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:58,720
licenses uh expire so having some kind

1145
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,720
of provision to do that

1146
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:05,599
um the use of non-medical marijuana on

1147
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:08,880
public property I I think we already

1148
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,920
prohibit smoking in most public places I

1149
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,680
think we should treat this in the same

1150
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,318
way that we treat

1151
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:18,440
tobacco

1152
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:20,400
um home delivery that's the one that you

1153
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:23,519
know as Lindsay said we don't

1154
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,720
necessarily regulate other Home

1155
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:29,159
Delivery I'm just concerned that home

1156
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:32,439
home delivery of marijuana that it might

1157
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:35,960
become a target for criminal activity uh

1158
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:38,519
especially if you have a a big delivery

1159
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,400
truck like a Brinks truck delivering

1160
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:42,880
marijuana that could be a target for

1161
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,280
people so I I'm not certain about what

1162
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,519
to do there

1163
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:52,319
um allowing uh licensed non-medical

1164
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:57,079
marijuana to cultivate marijuana indoors

1165
00:49:52,318 --> 00:50:00,039
I'm just not certain uh uh aot ing

1166
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:02,440
manufacturer extraction testing or

1167
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:06,480
processing again I'm not certain I'm not

1168
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:08,280
certain that our commercial areas are

1169
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,199
really appropriate for that I don't know

1170
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:14,480
enough about it um the warehousing and

1171
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:16,480
storage doesn't seem appropriate for

1172
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,880
West Hollywood we really don't have any

1173
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,240
other warehouses here for any kind of

1174
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:25,519
product so I just don't know that that's

1175
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:27,358
appropriate um reasonable regulations on

1176
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:30,480
indoor cultivation

1177
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:33,318
to Ure it doesn't exceed the parameters

1178
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:36,199
Allowed by law I I think that seems

1179
00:50:33,318 --> 00:50:38,400
reasonable that we would uh make sure

1180
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:42,279
that indoor cultivation complies with

1181
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:45,079
the law and uh outdoor cultivation

1182
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,960
backyards private patios or

1183
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:49,680
balconies I again as long as it's one or

1184
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,039
two plants I don't think anyone's going

1185
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:54,199
to notice or particularly care or that

1186
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:57,079
it's going to be a priority but I'd want

1187
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:58,639
to know a little bit more about that uh

1188
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:00,720
and I do think we should prohibit

1189
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:03,078
smoking of marijuana on city property

1190
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:06,039
just like I think we prohibit smoking

1191
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:08,240
tobacco on city property I may be

1192
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:10,639
incorrect there but I think we we

1193
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:12,479
probably should do that on the bigger

1194
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:16,318
policy

1195
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:20,400
issue I think the big issue for me is

1196
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:24,400
how do we ensure that we get the best

1197
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:27,039
possible operators the idea of opening

1198
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,960
it up and having you know first come

1199
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:33,480
first serve doesn't get us the best

1200
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,639
having a some kind of bidding more

1201
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,760
doesn't ensure that we get the best it

1202
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:39,838
may ensure that we get people who have

1203
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,319
the most money behind them but that

1204
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:44,400
doesn't mean that we're going to get the

1205
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:47,159
best operators so I really want us to

1206
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,960
come up with some kind of process where

1207
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:52,719
we're reviewing proposals and making

1208
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:55,119
sure that the people who are going to

1209
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:58,118
get the licenses in West Hollywood for

1210
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:02,000
this are going to be high

1211
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:04,838
quality um businesses that are serving

1212
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,358
the local community and serving visitors

1213
00:52:04,838 --> 00:52:09,838
to West Hollywood and providing a very

1214
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:13,159
positive

1215
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:15,838
experience thank you mayor proam I have

1216
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:19,199
some questions uh first of all does the

1217
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:21,719
ABC allow smoking marijuana in places

1218
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:21,719
that sell

1219
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:26,719
alcohol I mean we we won't I mean I mean

1220
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,838
that would be something to think think

1221
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:33,159
about we we'll look into that we don't

1222
00:52:28,838 --> 00:52:33,159
know that right now okay and then

1223
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:41,119
um uh we do allow smoking tobacco in our

1224
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:43,399
parks and so I but we also

1225
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,838
don't I mean there are there are going

1226
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,240
to be uh restrictions in terms of being

1227
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:49,639
near daycare centers and whatever so I

1228
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,199
think that's something that we have to

1229
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:54,558
think about and and also just to double

1230
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:57,318
check your map about where daycare

1231
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:01,319
centers are uh and schools because I

1232
00:52:57,318 --> 00:53:05,920
think mamones is missing from uh from

1233
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:08,039
the map and um dayare Center on

1234
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,559
Huntley right and there is no daycare

1235
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:13,519
center on Huntley however there are

1236
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:16,160
daycare centers that are in Los Angeles

1237
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:18,519
which are within a few you know blocks

1238
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:20,838
of West Hollywood and I think we need to

1239
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:23,639
take that into consideration whatever we

1240
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:27,039
decide should be in the spirit of you

1241
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:31,358
know the of of our law and should apply

1242
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:33,119
to La as well um I can see where we at

1243
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:38,558
least starting out we would want this to

1244
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:44,039
be a planning and uh business license um

1245
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:45,798
we we have uh M mcups for uh for alcohol

1246
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:48,798
licenses right we

1247
00:53:45,798 --> 00:53:50,719
need is that so I mean I think it is

1248
00:53:48,798 --> 00:53:53,358
something that we should um you know

1249
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:57,239
look into um I would imagine we want to

1250
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:58,798
look at you know maybe you know whatever

1251
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:02,639
what whatever we have in terms of the

1252
00:53:58,798 --> 00:54:04,159
medical marijuana now with um radius uh

1253
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:08,679
of how many you know we would want

1254
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:11,598
within you know a th000 foot radius uh

1255
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:14,759
how many uh how close we would want to

1256
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:16,838
allow a store uh to residential knowing

1257
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,160
that you know our residential and our

1258
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:22,199
commercial are very close together and

1259
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:26,639
we have had um you know some concerns

1260
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:30,358
about about uh places being uh you know

1261
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:33,199
what uh close to uh to residences so I

1262
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:35,679
think we need to be uh mindful of that

1263
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:37,679
um I know that we you know we want to be

1264
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:40,838
a leader in this but I I don't think it

1265
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:42,279
hurts to look at what what other states

1266
00:54:40,838 --> 00:54:44,960
have gone through to see what they've

1267
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,160
done right and what they've done you

1268
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,079
know what they've done where they're

1269
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:50,000
changing their their own laws now

1270
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:53,240
because of you know for example in

1271
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,679
Colorado wherever just to to to learn

1272
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:58,279
from others experience I I don't think

1273
00:54:55,679 --> 00:55:02,759
we necessarily have to reinvent the

1274
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:05,400
wheel um so I would um I would suggest

1275
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,000
that we look at that I mean I honestly I

1276
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:11,079
wish that we had had this report in

1277
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,199
January uh because it is complicated

1278
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:13,640
it's probably one of the most

1279
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:16,279
complicated issues that we're going to

1280
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:17,960
be dealing with and um I agree with

1281
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:22,359
council member Duran that I would like

1282
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:26,039
to get um you know uh advice from from

1283
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:28,880
experts in this field to um to have a a

1284
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:33,799
just feel more confident about about how

1285
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:37,720
we move forward uh with this um I also

1286
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:41,480
wonder um if if if this is a cash

1287
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:42,519
business how do we how do we ensure that

1288
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,280
we're

1289
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:47,639
getting the tax money whether you know I

1290
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,960
don't know the sales tax or any tax that

1291
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:51,798
we put on

1292
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,798
locally you know you know experience

1293
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:56,358
with cash businesses are That You Don't

1294
00:55:53,798 --> 00:55:57,358
See That You Don't See necessarily

1295
00:55:56,358 --> 00:56:01,759
everything

1296
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:04,920
that cash that's you know passing hands

1297
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:07,039
um I also have some concerns about uh

1298
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,039
delivery and so I you know again I mean

1299
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:12,079
I at this point I'm open but I think

1300
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:14,520
that it is important that we look at all

1301
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:16,640
sides of this because not only do you

1302
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:18,759
have the possibility of of a public

1303
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:22,118
safety issue for the people delivering

1304
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:25,039
but also the people who are who are

1305
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:26,838
receiving you know that they're that I

1306
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:29,119
mean someone a stranger is going into

1307
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:33,480
someone's home so I mean these are just

1308
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:37,280
all things to think about

1309
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:40,240
um and um you know regarding medical

1310
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,280
having uh some that are um the medical

1311
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,038
marijuana places versus the non

1312
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,720
non-medical I mean I can see where there

1313
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:49,799
would be benefits to keeping them

1314
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:53,318
separate also for the consumer because

1315
00:56:49,798 --> 00:56:55,880
uh you know the experience might be very

1316
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:58,480
different um you know for a consumer

1317
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:01,440
that is is using marijuana for for

1318
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,920
medical purposes for medicinal purposes

1319
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:07,039
they may not want the Frills and the you

1320
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:09,280
know fancy or whatever you know whatever

1321
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:11,520
different things that might be offered

1322
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,359
um they may just you know want to make

1323
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:17,199
sure that they go in that they feel safe

1324
00:57:14,358 --> 00:57:20,880
that they you know get their medicinal

1325
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:23,399
marijuana and they leave um and again I

1326
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:27,240
just think this is a this is a really

1327
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:29,559
complicated um a comp complicated issue

1328
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:32,159
and it's complicated in terms of land

1329
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:36,640
use and it's complicated in terms of uh

1330
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:40,598
licensing and um I think uh we need to

1331
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:43,159
um we need to move on this now pretty

1332
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:45,760
quickly if we want to make the uh

1333
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:48,358
January 2018 deadline because I don't

1334
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,680
think I don't think not doing anything

1335
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:53,719
is the

1336
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:56,639
answer council member Deo thank you

1337
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:59,118
thank excuse me thank you um Mr Mr hman

1338
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:02,318
can you uh go to the slide that showed

1339
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:04,039
the sort of suggested next steps I think

1340
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:07,759
it started with Community meetings and

1341
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:09,559
then a Planning Commission and so um I I

1342
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,359
just wanted to bring up for the council

1343
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:13,640
and the staff and actually really our

1344
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:14,519
city manager because he's our sort of

1345
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:17,199
Point

1346
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:20,000
person when we're not when we don't have

1347
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:23,279
a staff report but so I have the sense

1348
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,719
that we should probably have maybe uh 45

1349
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,440
Day updates or something like like that

1350
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:31,318
that really keeps us checked in I'm with

1351
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,880
council member Duran and I guess council

1352
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:35,759
member horv actually I don't remember if

1353
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:37,880
you said this or not but I'm I'm

1354
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,400
actually not thinking we need to have

1355
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:42,160
too many Community meetings I think it

1356
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,798
wouldn't hurt for our uh Chamber of

1357
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:48,480
Commerce to have a meeting and maybe one

1358
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:51,239
of their chamber mixers can be a uh

1359
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:54,440
cannabis you know a Canabis

1360
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:57,358
discussion um but I think uh I think our

1361
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,760
community you know we voted

1362
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:01,798
you don't want to buy pot don't go in a

1363
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:04,680
pot store I mean would sort of be it's a

1364
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:06,440
little flip but I think mayor Horvat I

1365
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:08,159
mean excuse me

1366
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:13,159
mayor

1367
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:14,960
me uh uh was clear that we want to uh be

1368
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:16,239
really careful about the neighborhoods

1369
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,920
we're placing them in and how we're

1370
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:19,519
going to interact with that but I just

1371
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,480
don't see that

1372
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:25,038
we we need to have several Community

1373
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,400
meetings to get input from our community

1374
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:31,359
members I think we need experts to tell

1375
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:33,798
us and I'm I I'm just concerned that

1376
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:36,199
late summer is a little late we have a

1377
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:38,798
meeting in typically a meeting in July

1378
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:40,480
and a meeting in August and last year we

1379
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:42,079
had one meeting in September one meeting

1380
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,798
in October one meeting in November one

1381
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:48,880
meeting in December so I'm thinking we

1382
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:52,038
probably need to have uh this discussion

1383
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:56,318
sooner than uh late summer which is

1384
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:59,200
September or or August uh because I

1385
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:00,558
think we need to give you enough time to

1386
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:04,519
do this and get it to the Planning

1387
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:08,480
Commission and have them and also our

1388
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:12,358
state will be making choices as well so

1389
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:15,519
um in terms of that process that's what

1390
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:18,279
I wanted to lay out two things that we

1391
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:19,639
really try and push up the council city

1392
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:22,160
council Direction on regulating

1393
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:26,920
marijuana and we have that maybe in July

1394
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:30,399
or August at the latest and that um

1395
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:32,318
uh we have I'm sorry the first meeting

1396
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,318
in a August I think there going to

1397
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:39,038
probably only be one so the first will

1398
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:42,318
be the only but and then uh

1399
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:44,960
uh ask our chamber to participate and

1400
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:47,159
maybe do one community meeting but but

1401
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,400
maybe that community meeting can happen

1402
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:53,239
after we make our initial direction to

1403
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,599
the council please can I suggest that

1404
01:00:53,239 --> 01:01:00,679
maybe we have a study session the city

1405
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:02,400
council and uh maybe with if you know

1406
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:04,960
with these experts I think that you know

1407
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:08,240
it's kind of unfair to have this

1408
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:10,440
discussion during a council meeting uh

1409
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:13,358
when there's you know we we really need

1410
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:15,400
to have the time and not feel pressured

1411
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:17,358
by the fact that it's you know 10:30 at

1412
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,960
night maybe a subcommittee how about a

1413
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:23,159
subcommittee of two so we can move more

1414
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:25,760
quickly you know I'm I'm fine with

1415
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:27,318
whatever my colleagues want uh you know

1416
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,680
I I don't think it would hurt to have a

1417
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:31,920
study session because I think we all we

1418
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:34,759
all want to have an idea of what's going

1419
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:37,798
on and what it all means and um and if

1420
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:39,240
we can do that maybe in June but maybe

1421
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:40,440
would that be too early well I was

1422
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:42,159
thinking before we got to the study

1423
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,559
session maybe a subcommittee of counil

1424
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,639
get in there and start working with the

1425
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:47,839
experts so at least we have two of us

1426
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:49,598
plugged in with all the experts and so

1427
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:51,440
we're able to talk to one another at the

1428
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:54,559
study session sure and then and then

1429
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:58,400
maybe have a study session in uh in June

1430
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:00,440
or July um with the council so that you

1431
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,880
know we can get our questions answered

1432
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,838
not feel like we're under pressure

1433
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:08,240
public would have an opportunity to

1434
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:12,038
listen and to uh you know give provide

1435
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:14,399
input um but again I think this is a

1436
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:18,119
complicated issue and I think you know

1437
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:20,720
having this discussion at 10:30 at night

1438
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:22,039
um when really I think we all we want we

1439
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:25,358
want to do this

1440
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:28,799
right um and I think it would be helpful

1441
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:32,000
at least for me uh to have that mayor if

1442
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:35,119
I may um we also did approve as a

1443
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,960
council the um annual cannabis education

1444
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:39,200
Forum that will be coming um and I

1445
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,159
believe it's happening in August so

1446
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:43,598
perhaps that might be an opportunity for

1447
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:45,679
folks to get a sense of the direction

1448
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:48,920
we're heading and what's happening um

1449
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:51,199
maybe we can at least have some role in

1450
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:53,159
that conversation um that's happening at

1451
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:54,919
that time mayor with the subcommittee I

1452
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:56,519
have an interest in doing it just

1453
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,318
experiences I have I don't know if any

1454
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:01,480
of my other colleagues wish to do

1455
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:03,440
subcommittee on

1456
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,760
this I'm interested but if you're

1457
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,960
interested or you're interested or I'm

1458
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,119
interested in doing it very much so I'm

1459
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:12,480
not really in favor of a subcommittee

1460
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,400
because I think it as the mayor said

1461
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,760
this is really important and I think we

1462
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,680
should all be involved with it from

1463
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:22,200
beginning to end okay that that seems

1464
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:24,558
fair too especially if we can do what

1465
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:27,598
she what she suggested is have a study

1466
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:31,079
session early at you know a six o'clock

1467
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:33,960
study session that maybe defers the

1468
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:35,920
start of our meeting a bit but gets this

1469
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:39,278
out because if we did that we would have

1470
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:41,720
150 people listening and that might be

1471
01:03:39,278 --> 01:03:45,880
part of the community effort as well

1472
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:47,959
okay and then um looking at staff um

1473
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:50,559
could we come back at the second meeting

1474
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:52,639
in June with that schedule of when we're

1475
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,839
going to have the study session and we

1476
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:58,920
could explain what the panels we'll have

1477
01:03:54,838 --> 01:03:58,920
a panel and I we can do that

1478
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:08,439
yes mayor Pro yeah I I think that based

1479
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,838
on what I'm hearing there is some broad

1480
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:14,039
consensus here that at least on some

1481
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:20,078
major points that the city does want to

1482
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:22,839
allow for um adult use cannabis uh I

1483
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:26,920
think council is recognizing that we

1484
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:29,400
play a regulatory role that we we have

1485
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:32,079
some questions about the nature of the

1486
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,318
regulations and some of the details but

1487
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:38,278
I think on the broad policy issue there

1488
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:40,920
is a some consensus here that it makes

1489
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:45,079
sense for us to be a leader here and

1490
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:47,960
have regulations in in place um

1491
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:49,798
beginning January of 2018 and I think

1492
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:53,720
there's at least a couple of us who've

1493
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:57,000
talked about the importance of um of

1494
01:04:53,719 --> 01:04:59,558
Taxation as well so I I think this is

1495
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,159
something that uh you've gotten some

1496
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:03,839
direction and hopefully when you come

1497
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:06,000
back to us we can narrow the focus and

1498
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:08,278
we'll have some more information but

1499
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,039
again thank you also I think I also

1500
01:05:08,278 --> 01:05:14,960
heard I think um that there wasn't a lot

1501
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:17,079
of support for um warehousing or

1502
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,358
manufacturing were those the only things

1503
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:21,400
taking place I was just actually going

1504
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:24,440
to jump in on that

1505
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:26,400
um I while I understand that

1506
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:28,200
geographically and based on the kinds of

1507
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,358
facilities we have in the city uh a

1508
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:34,000
warehouse and how we think about it is

1509
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:36,358
not probably not the likeliest thing to

1510
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,278
happen here but I do think that there

1511
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:40,960
may be some um and this is where experts

1512
01:05:39,278 --> 01:05:42,798
will be really helpful there are some

1513
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,159
potential opportunities for cultivation

1514
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:47,599
and sites that are the size of existing

1515
01:05:45,159 --> 01:05:49,679
buildings in West Hollywood and so and

1516
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:52,760
there might be some benefit to keeping

1517
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:55,278
all of that in one site versus having

1518
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:58,520
things traveling and transporting um I'm

1519
01:05:55,278 --> 01:06:02,199
not sure sure so while it sounds like we

1520
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:03,880
are likely in agreement about the

1521
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:06,078
likelihood of it happening in the city

1522
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:08,400
probably not I'm I am interested in

1523
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,359
knowing more from experts what the cost

1524
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,599
benefit of that might be and and I sort

1525
01:06:10,358 --> 01:06:17,558
of want to say the same thing about

1526
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:20,519
manufacturing I think um a sort of uh uh

1527
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:23,440
small um I don't want to say homemade

1528
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:26,639
but a a small Manu a small manufacturer

1529
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:29,639
who manufactured products uh in small

1530
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:31,480
batches that you know sort of that was

1531
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:33,960
their thing that was what they were

1532
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:36,519
providing you know here's where we make

1533
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:39,240
it here's where you buy it I I think we

1534
01:06:36,519 --> 01:06:41,318
want to we want to allow for for that as

1535
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:43,959
well like a like a fine restaurant or a

1536
01:06:41,318 --> 01:06:45,519
wine bar or you know so that sort of

1537
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,679
thing

1538
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:51,159
okay one one last thing as we look at

1539
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:54,038
regulations I think council member Deo

1540
01:06:51,159 --> 01:06:56,679
brought up the point of on-site use we

1541
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:59,960
treat on-site consum of alcohol

1542
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:01,719
different than um a retailer that sells

1543
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:05,159
alcohol and perhaps that's something

1544
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:05,159
that we should be looking at as

1545
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:14,719
well any anyone else okay

1546
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:16,960
exed so do we need a motion or did you

1547
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:18,480
just get I think that's the direction so

1548
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,920
I think we got a lot of good direction

1549
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,679
like you indicated um it's pretty clear

1550
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,720
that the city council wants us to go

1551
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:28,038
forward with looking at opening up up

1552
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:32,118
the city and making sure that we address

1553
01:07:28,039 --> 01:07:34,940
um this subject in a strong

1554
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:43,340
way thank you

1555
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:43,340
