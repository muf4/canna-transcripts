2
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:19,140
the plants that you received were bred

3
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:20,368
by Josh and he'll tell you about what he

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,500
did to make them and they'll give you

5
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:24,420
the correct name on him but the main

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,448
point was that I was so impressed with

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,769
them in flower form that I knew that

8
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,960
that it was something that had an

9
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,238
ability to absolutely catch an attention

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,670
of a customer and it's something that

11
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,439
you can't deny it when you smoked it

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,600
when you smelled it when you felt the

13
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,488
effects and it was quality and I want

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,530
that material to be shared so that the

15
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:45,328
individuals can and that was his desire

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,780
to is to see the public get their hands

17
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,609
on it

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,770
so we're back to another breeding

19
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,390
discussion and I'm gonna do the same

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,760
thing I'm gonna let the guys introduce

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:58,020
themselves and then we can start getting

22
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,399
into some questions and once again thank

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:05,850
you for taking the time to audio your

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:10,129
lives to listen to these discussions hi

25
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:10,129
I'm Graham mr. Bob Hemphill

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:17,890
[Applause]

27
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:19,929
I've been breeding Kym cannabis since 95

28
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:23,618
and collecting clones since about the

29
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:28,090
same time and growing cannabis for

30
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:30,280
production so I've made my life and just

31
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,009
dedicated most of my time the

32
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,950
preservation work with just keeping

33
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:39,759
strains alive that weren't even market

34
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:43,750
valuable anymore and amazingly 20 years

35
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,978
later they've come back around where you

36
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,140
know like the clubs need to have

37
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:50,140
something besides the cookies on the

38
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,719
market you know and just trying to have

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:55,269
a diversity in the gene pool so we can

40
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:59,618
get those old school buses and just

41
00:01:55,269 --> 00:02:04,179
thought kind of stuff so that's really

42
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:07,750
what I'm up to you guys kind of know me

43
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:11,829
I'm Joshua Rutherford I'm not really a

44
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:13,709
breeder I'm a pollen checker but

45
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:17,049
straight straight up like I you know I

46
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,909
feel like what I'm able to do is I have

47
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:20,109
a good nose and a good taste I got

48
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:21,789
blessed right away

49
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:24,400
the first two plants I ever grew was

50
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:27,340
Strawberry Cough in ATF and they were

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,799
legit cuts I've never seen maybe once or

52
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,819
twice as I've seen the ATF that even is

53
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:35,290
in the field and so I just got blessed

54
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:36,969
that way and so you know every time I

55
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:39,608
got something else it wasn't there was

56
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:44,590
like me being beep I just I throw throw

57
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:45,790
stuff away so fast I I'm heartless you

58
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,049
know I don't know if that's the best

59
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:49,298
thing there's probably other things you

60
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,609
can pull but it allowed me to do is to

61
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:53,379
make some money and to kind of be pretty

62
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:58,599
self funded I do have a small partner

63
00:02:53,379 --> 00:03:01,870
but anyways so this one is um hi ho from

64
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:05,048
Kenner auto genetics I got and it was

65
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,219
feminized and so I wanted to sift

66
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:07,689
through and make sure I got the ones

67
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,699
that we're gonna have any Herms right so

68
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:11,479
I'm not really down with colloidal

69
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:13,429
silver or

70
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:15,189
whatever the other stuff is and so I

71
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,569
hadn't accidentally learned a technique

72
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:19,849
by throwing too much seabird guano

73
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:22,519
pellets down which is a super high in

74
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:25,039
nitrogen and so I I heard out the whole

75
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,710
bottom of my Obama Koosh one time and it

76
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,239
was just the bottoms and I was like okay

77
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,070
well that's something so I searched and

78
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,050
searched and searched and and somewhere

79
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:35,209
I found they Oh too much nitrogen will

80
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,800
force herm and so I was like okay so I

81
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,120
tried it another time I tried three or

82
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,420
four times and it's pretty predictable

83
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,409
you know I can buy the seabird guano

84
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:45,469
pellets throw them down pretty hard

85
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:47,930
water I mean really hard and it it works

86
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:50,930
so that's what I did with the PI hoe and

87
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,810
then I also had in the room this

88
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,629
Catholic schoolgirl that was pretty cool

89
00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:00,530
and then this ruched seven from Kevin

90
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:02,299
and so I was actually scratching my head

91
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,560
on it cuz I'm just kind of reading into

92
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,050
breeding and so I was scratching my head

93
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,370
I hit up gene on Instagram and it's like

94
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,990
what should I do with this like is this

95
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,569
gonna just be a bunch of Hern bullshit

96
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:14,930
and he's like apple doesn't fall far

97
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:16,839
from the tree like okay that's not

98
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,100
enough information but it kind of is

99
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,819
that's how I felt so I went for it you

100
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,530
know whatever

101
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:25,879
so I ran 300 seeds of it and I spent you

102
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:27,529
know all night going through those cuts

103
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:29,360
and I pulled that about six of them and

104
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:32,809
and then smoked them and this is the one

105
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,580
I kept and uh I've run it twice and it

106
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,379
doesn't hurt I let it run extra long and

107
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:39,050
stuff so I've kind of checked it so it's

108
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:41,750
definitely stable and it's real big and

109
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:44,689
beefy I run it in the greenhouse it's

110
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,069
super floral I wouldn't put it in the

111
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:48,110
fruit category and there's not a lot

112
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:50,240
that I call floral that or that's come

113
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,900
across my palate that's really been

114
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,668
floral and it's it's a it's a different

115
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:57,679
customer like it my mom my parents

116
00:04:55,668 --> 00:05:00,949
actually smoked it probably shouldn't

117
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,569
say that on the Internet yeah a couple

118
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,969
weeks ago for the first time in like 30

119
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:06,529
years you know and I just let him have a

120
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,690
little bit of it but it was perfect

121
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:11,269
because it's a real bright uplifting

122
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:13,219
happy high my mom was just like what

123
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:15,799
what is this flavor it it's kind of like

124
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,000
this muted lemon floor but you know

125
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,819
that's I know that's fruit but it's real

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,978
muted and florally rosey and yeah so I

127
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,069
was super happy with it now when I was

128
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:24,599
coming down I

129
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:25,920
to give something back to keV cuz he

130
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,510
gave me some stuff and so I was like oh

131
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,810
this is perfect they see it you know so

132
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:33,569
that's kind of yeah man thanks for for

133
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,759
being cool you know it's it's a it's a

134
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:38,430
nice one and and the thing was before

135
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,399
before I hardly get into it what's nice

136
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,959
about the panel is that I could

137
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,299
centigram like a preservationist cuz

138
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,589
he's he's someone who whole there is

139
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,870
many times I was talked to a man he

140
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:50,429
holds varietals for time and preserves

141
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,110
him because he believes in the priceless

142
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,449
innocent of it not just in business but

143
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,639
to himself and to the cannabis culture

144
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,709
and and Hardy

145
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,349
it was his scientific reader where he

146
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:04,289
has a very extensive background in many

147
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,879
different things and so it gives you a

148
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,260
different direction and then Josh says

149
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,819
I'm just a pollen chuckle but the truth

150
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,379
is I wanted to see people who would just

151
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,500
pollen chocolates cuz that's where

152
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:15,389
everybody started and what happens is

153
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,639
that you start to believe you don't have

154
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,459
a validity if you're not someone special

155
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,129
and the truth of it is is that you you

156
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:25,409
have to be able to start somewhere and

157
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:27,139
to get a plant that's that quality from

158
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,730
someone who's just the pollen chucker

159
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,860
lets you realize that you also can

160
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,840
succeed and it's important because it

161
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,520
lets you it lets you take and inspire

162
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,199
other people who are gonna follow you

163
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,269
every one of you will eventually have

164
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,789
someone who takes your place in the game

165
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:43,289
and it's important to be able to have

166
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,200
people that are gonna take your place

167
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,180
that have good ethics and a desire to

168
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,769
smoke kill weed otherwise you're gonna

169
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,379
be an old man filled in a land full of

170
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:54,209
boof and that's it's or women you know

171
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,490
it's and it's not what you want so um

172
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:58,799
it's beautiful to have the diversity and

173
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,860
I'll let Hardy go but that's the whole

174
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,650
point of it that that your your lack of

175
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,689
full time professional breeding doesn't

176
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:08,939
diminish your validity at all it's just

177
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:12,389
it to me you are the symbol of people

178
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:17,399
who love weed and let their taste guide

179
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:20,310
them in their process no that's that's

180
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,589
kion Hardy with have Cora genetics and

181
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:26,670
was as in care collective we're one of

182
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:30,569
the first well dispensary delivery out

183
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:32,640
of Mendocino 9.31 program and rode that

184
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:33,879
out till the end and then Mendocino

185
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,490
County as we know this

186
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,170
continue the 9.3 so at that time just

187
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,319
switched everything over to R&amp;D and

188
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:45,550
breeding and working with CBD cultivars

189
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:47,319
so that was that focus in 2009-10 where

190
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,389
you tell people show lab results and

191
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,550
they'd see CBD and it's like why are you

192
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:53,829
growing this you know they don't relate

193
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:56,860
to that and at a point earlier one thing

194
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:59,289
was even this was 2012 if you got caught

195
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:03,270
with lab results or seeds you're a

196
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:06,900
sophisticated operation and you could

197
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:09,129
you you were in more trouble

198
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:11,199
so if you had pictures and this is

199
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:12,939
something seeing this evolution and it's

200
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,979
like you're not a being a pollen chucker

201
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:17,230
it's like we were all chucking pollen in

202
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,390
the beginning back here when it was like

203
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,340
growing up around here when you had to

204
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:23,019
hide out in a fucking tree when you had

205
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:25,839
a helicopter coming over you sideways

206
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:26,919
and you just had a little bit of pollen

207
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,989
that you had to put on high and

208
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,540
pollinate on that plant at a certain

209
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,750
time but it was only one little plant so

210
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,668
this is how the especially this is

211
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,769
Ground Zero and it's amazing to see this

212
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:41,228
many people here like coming out like

213
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:43,710
this and I know things are changing but

214
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:47,290
we are like everybody in here is like

215
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:49,150
pioneer to the roots like this is coming

216
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:52,719
back home this last year and traveling

217
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:54,759
so much it's like you guys are this is

218
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,350
the shit right here like as far as when

219
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,000
you're gonna find good old genetics and

220
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,580
people that really have that hard a soul

221
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,970
and this last year having to travel

222
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,930
around and seeing the big corporations

223
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:10,600
that are coming in and just this general

224
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:13,839
disrespect or disregard for the history

225
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,879
of the plant that people here

226
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,470
responsible for keeping this plant alive

227
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:24,189
and being stewards of of these genetics

228
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,810
and now it's just kind of coming

229
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,810
together and part of this is like

230
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:30,939
collecting this data and part of that IP

231
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:34,359
because we all have something special to

232
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:37,360
offer and don't discount that because

233
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,950
everybody here has something their own

234
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,950
kung fu to bring to the table

235
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:51,379
what I was gonna say is what when you

236
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,180
first began and then in you know 95 zone

237
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:54,409
what were you what was the stuff that

238
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:56,239
you were working with when you first get

239
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:58,909
into cannabis because it must have had a

240
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,438
profound impact on the fact that it made

241
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:02,059
you love it so much that you never let

242
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:05,240
go of it because you're uh you're a

243
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:06,909
dedicated collector what was the stock

244
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,350
you were working with when you begin

245
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:13,278
unfortunately I don't have any of those

246
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:17,120
seats anymore but it new year's show and

247
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:21,049
between 94 to 95 like squirt some but

248
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,709
from humble and it was purple and grape

249
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:26,568
and just dink as fuck and that's what

250
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,549
encouraged me to like breed with the

251
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:29,990
males and females the next year is

252
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:31,458
because I wanted to have some more of

253
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:35,299
that because in years prior to that I

254
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:41,719
just grew Mexican back seat you know cuz

255
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:44,179
I there was no tank available and it's a

256
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,480
shame at the time I really didn't know

257
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:49,729
about breeding brothers the sisters that

258
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,129
just didn't seem right to me so I out

259
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:55,579
crossed that strain to Southern Virginia

260
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:58,308
lines and didn't keep it pure but if I

261
00:10:55,578 --> 00:11:00,019
would have open pollinated that line and

262
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:04,308
kept it pure I would really have had

263
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:06,528
something special because it was amazing

264
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:10,009
I'll never forget I was at a Grateful

265
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:13,068
Dead show that next spring and I still

266
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:15,318
had summon there's these really pretty

267
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:19,009
girls from California on dead tour and I

268
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:20,750
showed him a bud and I didn't even say

269
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:23,480
that I grew and breaded I just said it

270
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,399
was from Virginia and they just laughed

271
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,139
at me and like started clowning me

272
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,129
thinking I was lying trying to pick him

273
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:34,188
up but I still think back and that was

274
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:37,459
some amazing when he dank just Afghan

275
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:40,009
purple shit that was probably Arkell

276
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:42,359
related

277
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:44,330
ya know I think that was like that that

278
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,769
was look at the little heyday of that

279
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,839
transition from the last of the outdoor

280
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:50,819
that still remained before the raids

281
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,710
here then the raids came in people's

282
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,020
populations compressed and then indoor

283
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,670
just blew up and that's when I started

284
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,259
seeing a lot of these old lines being

285
00:11:56,669 --> 00:12:00,870
woven out because they just didn't work

286
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,860
on the indoor platform but yeah I don't

287
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,028
have a lot of this stuff from that

288
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,740
either that's what I'm trying to go back

289
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:06,539
and dig through time and find older

290
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,879
people that were able to hold on to

291
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:10,528
little pieces there's none of us really

292
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,429
know thing knew what we had we kind of

293
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:13,620
thought that it was gonna be here

294
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:15,569
forever like that because it had just

295
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,649
come into our hands you know you didn't

296
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,920
really have the same level of

297
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:21,839
appreciation for the scarcity now that

298
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,179
you did then you were like whoa I'll get

299
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,430
more good stuff so you went into the

300
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,439
early / the early person and are you

301
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:30,028
talking about this first stuff that you

302
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,709
really started messing around was that

303
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:36,600
the ATF caught yeah I actually still

304
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:38,879
hold it that's the only thing I've been

305
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,129
able to keep my whole damn grow career

306
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,769
I've lost a lot of stuff but we kept it

307
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:45,600
among three guys so it came into the

308
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:48,449
house we started you know busted and out

309
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,730
and four thousand a pack you know I

310
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,320
figured the game this out real quick in

311
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,940
a year and a half four thousand a pack

312
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,500
I've you know see you guys I'm moving

313
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,670
you know you guys are owned in that

314
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:02,190
basement and but it was um yeah it's the

315
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:03,659
the musky Asst earthy ax sting I think

316
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,430
I've ever smelled straight-up you know I

317
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:08,579
kind of sniff around to see if I can

318
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:10,289
find anything it's like forest floor I'd

319
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,270
love to talk to anybody that has any

320
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,519
experience with that with that cut Dino

321
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:16,439
Josh and Kelly have some connection to

322
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,429
the Matanuska I'm not sure the exact

323
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,620
difference some people say it's the same

324
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:24,449
but it's real fluffy and it's weak I

325
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,799
could see it across the room in that jar

326
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,589
we all would be like what's that one

327
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,599
it's white bring that one over here you

328
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:32,760
know and it's interesting cuz

329
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,200
marketability it's it it's fluffy you

330
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,259
know you when you grab it other charts

331
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,470
like oh I don't know pop that thing open

332
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:42,450
it fills the room and yeah so I'm

333
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,740
interested to like actually start

334
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,829
working and putting some stuff into it

335
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,269
so my goal the summer is to you know run

336
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:50,939
a bunch of stuff and find some mails

337
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:52,409
that I think will put some stuff on it

338
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,890
and just you know try to start learning

339
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:54,569
like

340
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:56,370
like which accent said was earlier I

341
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,770
know this ATF really well you know I can

342
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,360
walk into a garden and see crosses with

343
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:02,850
it actually I found that the other day

344
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,039
and a 502 garden they had a a Calley

345
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,170
crush crossed with it as like before she

346
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,490
could say ATF I was like ATF you know

347
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:10,049
just three leaves they always look the

348
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,389
same you know she's like how'd you know

349
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:19,259
I go I've been staring at that plant for

350
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:21,389
10 years you know so you're you're a old

351
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:23,490
school cat from the day here yeah and

352
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:25,139
that's one thing with this strings these

353
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,549
days and like looking somebody'd

354
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,220
mentioned earlier like looking at the

355
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:31,049
chemo type we've gotten so caught up in

356
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,000
this name game anymore it's like having

357
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:35,339
to backtrack from this and that was one

358
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,899
thing looking at CDD CBDs and other

359
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,540
cannabinoids it's like okay we're the

360
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:42,179
origins of this one recently is the

361
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:44,009
Varens and we're the Varens are the

362
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:46,439
origins of the Varens and we're finding

363
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:49,860
more from like that Africa from Africa

364
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,960
and like Lao areas so why are why is

365
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,060
this happening but it's like we're it's

366
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,370
having to backtrack right now so some of

367
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:59,009
these older sativas that weren't

368
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,049
marketable then it's that that's that's

369
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:02,819
still that smell and it's out there and

370
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:05,069
if that's the thing it's up its up in

371
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,410
these areas but Jerry for instance it's

372
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,629
like with that Panama red and going back

373
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:11,819
and like these poisons and like you go

374
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:14,669
back in history and on this lineage it's

375
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,080
identifying the baseline so that's

376
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:19,799
something the last couple years I've

377
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:22,440
been working on is Kuwait is breeding

378
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,899
bringing these older cultivars back and

379
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,210
getting that baseline back and then sort

380
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,159
of moving forward from there it's like

381
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,720
looking at it like that color palette of

382
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,059
like you have your CMYK you know you

383
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,180
have your basic colors so let's start

384
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:37,889
with this and from there we identify

385
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:40,500
these different traits and now that

386
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:44,039
we're able to look at the key mo type

387
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,500
and genotype of what these what are the

388
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:48,120
constituents of the cultivar that you're

389
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,549
looking for so it's like if you're

390
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,990
looking to make extract and that's all

391
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,209
you're looking for you want that Orange

392
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,399
to juice with those terpenes or if

393
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,000
you're going for just certain

394
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,419
cannabinoid

395
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,120
and and identifying those genetics so

396
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:05,378
it's like we've been monoculture so much

397
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,049
here especially in Northern California

398
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:10,269
being run by Sour Diesel and og because

399
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:12,729
this is the market this is what just put

400
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:14,970
in the paycheck in so that these

401
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,819
cultivars have been lost that were

402
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:21,149
actually have probably more of a value

403
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:23,588
because of what they have inside of them

404
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:25,778
instead of the marketability of what

405
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:28,509
that pretty flower looks like per unit

406
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:30,818
you know that's going to a market so

407
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:32,709
it's like looking at these cultivars at

408
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:35,198
what we're growing maybe not per gram

409
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:38,169
per square meter or per foot or light

410
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:41,378
but milligram it's like what is what's

411
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:43,299
inside of this and that's something

412
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:45,819
looking into especially the you know the

413
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:47,799
original cultivars these are where that

414
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:50,169
the treasures are and starting to

415
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:53,349
backtrack right now and actually collect

416
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:55,208
the data because that's where that IP

417
00:16:53,350 --> 00:17:01,240
that all of us have worked our ass off

418
00:16:55,208 --> 00:17:05,470
for is a value what are you we're gonna

419
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:08,558
get into some I'm gonna ask gram you

420
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:13,720
know what what what directions are you

421
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:15,788
moving into and you're here in Cali but

422
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,199
you're in Washington so the question is

423
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:20,230
gonna be you know what directions are

424
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,179
you seeing in your region and and then

425
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,429
your global you see a global picture

426
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:26,409
because you are connected to so many

427
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:27,459
different things and it was his way

428
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:29,470
we'll be able to see what's going on

429
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:31,600
here what's going on where you are

430
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:36,610
what's going on from your view we're on

431
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:40,178
a world wide picture so mostly I just

432
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:43,109
I'm working on some real strong Northern

433
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:46,450
Lights indicas and hash plants and

434
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:49,048
trying to get the old-school indicas in

435
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:52,620
a seed form so it's more axial

436
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:56,230
accessible to people I'm also working on

437
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:58,658
constantly doing open pollination zhan

438
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:03,038
different land races just to preserve

439
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:05,559
them and on top of that I'm also working

440
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:08,710
on several different lines and CBD

441
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:09,509
trying to isolate the CBD I'm working on

442
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:13,410
a Panama

443
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:16,859
that originally went from two - one two

444
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:19,048
three - once in the next generation and

445
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:21,298
then in this next generation after that

446
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:24,769
I've just found a 39 - one which is

447
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:27,539
pretty exciting so I'm really excited to

448
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:29,150
flower that out and check check the

449
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,529
percentages

450
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:34,919
what are some of the land races you

451
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:38,069
playing with well I just try to work

452
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:41,160
with and preserve any that I can get my

453
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:44,069
hands on and um you know a lot of people

454
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:47,910
in the seat buying market say they want

455
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:50,399
land race they really want good land

456
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,620
race that works well for them they don't

457
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,740
want every land race because there's a

458
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:57,569
lot of problems and you know when you're

459
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,069
doing a true open pollination you're not

460
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:04,918
even calling out there hermaphrodites

461
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:08,909
you know so it's just mostly for

462
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:11,160
preservation and look for good strains

463
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,900
that maybe I can pull the next seeds out

464
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,340
and make out crosses with them that's

465
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,660
something that would work for the for

466
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:22,319
the market but when I do find a good one

467
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,570
that I can release I will but it's lots

468
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,689
of times there's problems with the line

469
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:33,149
or this source doesn't want it release

470
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:34,289
pure unfortunately because I I've seen

471
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,400
some of the Northern Light the work

472
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:37,798
you're doing it's over the hash plant

473
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,750
and to me it's awesome because I mean

474
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,450
that was stuff that was red-hot and

475
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:45,390
ultra quality and it's time frame and it

476
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,830
I think kind of deluded as time went by

477
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,809
and I try to tell people the source

478
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:51,269
material was not weak there was some

479
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:52,859
stunning stock so it's killer that you

480
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:55,019
go and back that route and it seems like

481
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:57,418
it's pretty well-received - you know I

482
00:19:55,019 --> 00:20:00,480
see some interaction around it you know

483
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:02,419
some just basically trying to duplicate

484
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,710
a lot of Neville's work and

485
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:06,299
unfortunately since he seedbank didn't

486
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:10,769
do a good job and keeping those genes

487
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:14,099
pulls so I had the old cuts and luckily

488
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:16,980
just the no:1 came to me from when I was

489
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:19,959
working with coastal seats and cake you

490
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:23,890
had gotten it from classic seeds

491
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:27,900
it was just things came together in a

492
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:32,440
really good situation with that wine and

493
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:35,620
Cantor Otto just gifted me some two by

494
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,690
fives that he made F Tucson and the

495
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:42,039
original F ones were made from Jim

496
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:43,900
Ortega and that's a eighty seed bank

497
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:48,339
stock and I'm real excited about that

498
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:50,590
because that's you know just the fact

499
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:53,709
that that can help share that into the

500
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:56,319
gene pool again is just a good place to

501
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,360
be you know it's awesome like I said I'm

502
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,439
older and and the the problem is that

503
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:01,299
you have all these fond memories of

504
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,529
stuff from a day when people try to tell

505
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:04,000
you that you know that shit's outdated

506
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:07,509
but I'm like I'm telling you no it's not

507
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,859
and it's gone and so you pine for the

508
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:10,509
memories in the past and when I see

509
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:11,889
people digging things out I get excited

510
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:13,869
because it lets me know that things are

511
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:16,600
still alive and lets you also know that

512
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:18,699
the your belief that trends continuously

513
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:19,869
move forward role and so it was cool to

514
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,330
see the Northern Lights work you've been

515
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:24,219
doing yeah yeah there was some of the

516
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:27,250
first kind but that I got a chance to

517
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,690
smoke when I was a kid and I just want

518
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,519
to say something that's not quite on

519
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,650
that topic but I wanted to get it out

520
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:35,680
here to the everyone so when I first

521
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:37,810
moved on the Emerald triangle in 97

522
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,830
there was an amazing amount of genetics

523
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:45,429
every farm had their own genetics

524
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:47,019
amazing strains first there was a purple

525
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:49,810
wave and then then there was the og

526
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:51,609
diesel wave and basically a lot of farms

527
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,730
stopped growing those original and

528
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:56,949
genetics just to sell their buddies here

529
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:00,339
so they got on the purple bandwagon then

530
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:03,309
they got on the gas bandwagon but you

531
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:04,959
know the people still have the genetics

532
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:07,000
here in the county it might be your

533
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,450
neighbor it might be your family

534
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,329
relatives whatever it is find those old

535
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:15,370
seeds and get out I'm out and if you're

536
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:17,409
not gonna work with them yourself give

537
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:19,750
them the someone that will and let's try

538
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,880
to preserve some of this amazing gene

539
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,299
pool that's still intact around this

540
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,300
county

541
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:34,370
but uh that's a good segue to what you

542
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:37,490
you asked about like some of the trends

543
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:39,799
were seen in Washington and we're closed

544
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:42,500
nothing comes in our little legal box

545
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:47,029
right now and it's super unfortunate you

546
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:50,059
know we can get stuff out for instance

547
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:51,710
like how did I get that out I I sold it

548
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:53,839
to myself as a medical patient from my

549
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,090
wreck farm to me and then it can go out

550
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:59,539
from there but I can't put anything back

551
00:22:56,089 --> 00:23:00,919
in so the trend has been really

552
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:02,930
interesting right now I you know

553
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,980
everyone's really excited that weed on

554
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:07,940
the shelves is starting to look better

555
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,529
but it's we're just so steps so far

556
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,420
behind where we were before they killed

557
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:14,089
medical you know the good weed on the

558
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,769
shelves is just hydro weed and you could

559
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:17,959
you open it up some of it smells good

560
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,160
none of it tastes good you know I don't

561
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,750
want to say none of it there's some good

562
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,560
cultivators but you know kana as I

563
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,490
pervade the whole scene so um yeah I

564
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,049
don't know we're just seeing a lot of

565
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,730
the hot stuff that comes through that

566
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:32,359
people want to latch on to wedding cake

567
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,740
you know cookies crosses but I do want

568
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:35,000
to say it like I feel like you know

569
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,150
we're a couple years ahead of you guys

570
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,559
in this and it's that it's starting to

571
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,380
turn you know we just have had a couple

572
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:44,059
of bills that came up to allow they're

573
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,810
not voted in yet but to allow for small

574
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:49,669
farmers to sell direct and the the head

575
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:51,859
of the LCB the liquor liquor cannabis

576
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,779
board spoke twice publicly about being

577
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:55,219
behind and this like actually called

578
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:56,930
these guys I like I'm like you got you

579
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,170
know like this would save my family's

580
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:02,029
life like 10 days I turn around like you

581
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,440
know we'd pay our bills in 10 days if I

582
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:04,789
could sell this weed that I have here

583
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,580
that people will actually really want

584
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:10,269
but when I go into the stores they go is

585
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:14,149
it over 20% does it look like a cookie

586
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:15,829
no it's like I went I was I had to write

587
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,269
all this is gonna go off on this I had a

588
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,500
really you know I don't want to be too

589
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:20,210
negative but a hard experience this

590
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,549
summer heads I brought in some you know

591
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,470
I'm actually not in the retail market

592
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:25,970
I've just been kind of like creeping

593
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:29,000
along and so I brought some really

594
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,589
beautiful DEP in to retail and I'd you

595
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,210
know we do the whole thing so I packaged

596
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:34,789
it I did all of it right at trim did I

597
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,000
put it in these jars one ounce jars two

598
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:39,029
flavors

599
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,130
garlic-breath in the pie ho rough

600
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:43,710
trimmed right

601
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:45,990
$55 it's in glass it's organic it's some

602
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:47,940
grown like what else can you want I even

603
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:50,370
said hey man show me what you got in the

604
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,980
price range do you know 150 175 200

605
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:55,559
bucks on your shelf like what brown from

606
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,269
last year yellow from last year like

607
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:58,559
don't you think this looks better do you

608
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:01,289
think it would sell that's not organic

609
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,750
this is you know nothing because all

610
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:04,980
they want is that above 20% they want

611
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,230
that fucking tight thing and they go

612
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:10,950
with a go what else you got I go dude

613
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:13,140
I grew all this weed I'm two miles from

614
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,819
your store like I'm the guy that on the

615
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,860
TV that they want to talk about and he's

616
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:18,929
like what else you got you got some sex

617
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:20,969
lube you got some chapstick I'm like no

618
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:24,150
bro I'll go make some sweatshirts but

619
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,440
you know and but just kind of telling

620
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:28,470
all that that like I feel like that's

621
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,730
still coming big for you guys but you

622
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,870
know we've been talking over and over

623
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,579
again and we're just starting to see it

624
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:35,189
so I'm personally feeling encouraged

625
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:37,199
there's some some guys that just started

626
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,830
a you know bought a license and they

627
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,500
started with 16 lights and they got

628
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:44,639
certified Dominion seed skunk and he

629
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,349
came over and helped to make the

630
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,120
selections and they're selling out

631
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:49,679
they're crushing it everyone's talking

632
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:51,839
about this little sixteen light and

633
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,340
they're just you know they're doing the

634
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,709
thing we're talking about but just you

635
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:58,109
know nano almost microbe you know so

636
00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:00,840
that's kind of what I see coming for

637
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:03,059
Washington is just kind of the slow slow

638
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,619
thing and in and to be honest I'm

639
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:06,299
waiting for another wave of it because

640
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:08,429
the the federal curtain hasn't dropped

641
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,990
and we haven't really talked about that

642
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:13,110
yet but like the people who we think are

643
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:14,460
big boys in California they might not be

644
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:16,919
the big boys when the federal curtain

645
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,880
drops you know Canada is I brought it up

646
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:22,380
last night it's scary dude it's scary so

647
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,580
it's just you know that's what how I see

648
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,440
it is like we got to keep doing this

649
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:32,279
coming together share with each other

650
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:34,460
find a way to survive and yeah I feel

651
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,460
you

652
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:46,619
yeah yeah this last year it's like

653
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:49,600
traveling more and working in

654
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:51,219
Switzerland and Africa as well and you

655
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,139
have now India and Colombia blowing up

656
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:57,100
these people talking thousands of

657
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:59,980
hectares this qualifies right now is him

658
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:02,319
and it's that point zero three percent

659
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,259
Switzerland it's one percent Macedonia

660
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:07,089
just opened up one and a half percent

661
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:09,339
they use point zero three percent as

662
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:10,869
this baseline so this last year was

663
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:13,209
breeding seeds especially for the

664
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:16,859
European market African market they want

665
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:19,630
feminized auto flowers and it's just

666
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:21,729
filled planet and they're going in and

667
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,470
harvesting with combines they're just

668
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:27,579
looking at it it's all going into

669
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:29,920
isolate so you have this this market

670
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:32,439
that is just CBD Hungary and what

671
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,410
qualifies that is this point zero three

672
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,080
percent these new cultivars though it's

673
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:39,790
wind to harvest them as well because we

674
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,099
have time it's like you go at eight

675
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:43,720
weeks and you're you're gonna be right

676
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:45,909
under that hot point and all of a sudden

677
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,370
you hit nine ten and some of these will

678
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:50,170
jump up and depending on the climate and

679
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:52,239
work you're taking tissue culture so you

680
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,340
can have vitro coming from the u.s.

681
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,190
going to Switzerland this the same

682
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,779
culture and it's the way it's performing

683
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,400
just like anything but its environment

684
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:03,849
and then you look at the the whole

685
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,490
profile of the plant and this is how

686
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:08,349
this is evolving so rapidly and right

687
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,700
now it's this hemp thing after this farm

688
00:28:08,349 --> 00:28:13,029
bill passed especially here in the

689
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,950
states it's on the scalability so that's

690
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:17,619
the one thing with the CBD market right

691
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:22,090
now here in the states it's this there's

692
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:24,459
this huge demand last week the state in

693
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:25,809
California they said that and this is

694
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,720
something I don't know if it's been

695
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:31,089
talked about or whatnot but is that male

696
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,829
pollen is the state is looking

697
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:34,829
regulators looking at it as a weapon

698
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:39,399
this is something that the this is

699
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:41,619
somebody that doesn't know what they're

700
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,509
talking about but at that same time so

701
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:45,279
what's that gonna do for a breeder to

702
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:46,308
restrict you if you're gonna have a male

703
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,608
plant

704
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:51,469
you can't flower that male pollen out or

705
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:53,210
you're gonna you know these are things

706
00:28:51,469 --> 00:28:55,999
that are in California we are so

707
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:58,038
regulated here like in you can go to

708
00:28:55,999 --> 00:29:01,249
Vermont right now in $25.00 permit and

709
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:03,288
if you have 500 acres you can plan it so

710
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:05,839
what you know this of we're here dealing

711
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:07,759
with we're dealing with the most intense

712
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,589
adverse conditions pretty much on a

713
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,358
global scale right now and especially

714
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:15,348
here where we've spearheaded this

715
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:17,148
movement so as things change it's like

716
00:29:15,348 --> 00:29:18,648
adapting here and that's the one thing

717
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:20,868
it's like these new strains everybody

718
00:29:18,648 --> 00:29:23,538
has something unique here and it's that

719
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:25,579
something differentiating you do have to

720
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:26,960
feed into this you know the market what

721
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:29,449
it dick state right now and the

722
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,028
consumers is going to dictate what a

723
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:34,879
farmer grows as well that's that's part

724
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:42,378
of it so it's growing something that is

725
00:29:34,878 --> 00:29:44,058
from your heart do you do you see in

726
00:29:42,378 --> 00:29:46,668
your opinion you know as genetics move

727
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:49,788
globally product moves globally do you

728
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:51,339
see material moving from one place to

729
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,118
another specifically do you see

730
00:29:51,338 --> 00:29:55,009
individuals that you believe will become

731
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:57,858
dominant in the production model is

732
00:29:55,009 --> 00:30:00,259
there opportunities for the u.s. to move

733
00:29:57,858 --> 00:30:02,329
product globally you know I mean what's

734
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:05,450
an opinion question but you know how do

735
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:07,158
you feel about it yeah and that's

736
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,288
something right now we're falling behind

737
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:11,059
very quickly especially with you know

738
00:30:09,288 --> 00:30:13,219
CBD and isolate and what they're able to

739
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:14,838
produce in in Africa in these other

740
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:16,369
countries and have these establishing

741
00:30:14,838 --> 00:30:18,469
these international markets with

742
00:30:16,368 --> 00:30:21,048
importing and exporting through through

743
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:23,058
Canada through Australia through these

744
00:30:21,048 --> 00:30:24,679
other companies and a lot of these other

745
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:26,960
businesses they don't want to touch the

746
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,009
US market there's enough profit they

747
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,169
don't need me to deal with the

748
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:31,878
regulations so we've been getting seeds

749
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:34,099
right now to try to get a true breeding

750
00:30:31,878 --> 00:30:36,228
seed or regulated within the state of

751
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:38,509
California or within these other states

752
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:40,308
for export to go through and get your

753
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:43,999
international Narcotics Bureau license

754
00:30:40,308 --> 00:30:46,278
for exporting we're behind and I don't

755
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:48,649
know you know moving forward on that it

756
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:53,778
takes the capital and that's the thing

757
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:56,628
we're talking a little behind it to move

758
00:30:53,778 --> 00:30:59,089
this forward requires a help from

759
00:30:56,628 --> 00:31:01,009
private sector but also the academia

760
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:03,559
sector and finding that here in

761
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:06,259
especially California with the new hemp

762
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:08,329
bill if you have an academic tie to a

763
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:11,450
university we're gonna be able to allow

764
00:31:08,329 --> 00:31:13,129
to cultivate and breed hemp cannabis you

765
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,809
know it's like growing the dank like

766
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:17,000
that's where we were able to do right

767
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:19,970
now is crossbreed to something you get

768
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,980
that it's just fire dank that it tests

769
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:25,610
at that point zero three percent so it's

770
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:27,079
him to explain that right now to the

771
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:29,000
authorities and the powers would be they

772
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:30,439
still don't wrap their head around it so

773
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,329
let's breed the shit out of everything

774
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,400
we can to get the dank out there not the

775
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:36,019
qualifies as hemp that's what they're

776
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,880
gonna look at it they don't you know if

777
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:40,039
you have the Terps and you have a whole

778
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,380
cannabinoid profile as long as it

779
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:47,119
doesn't have THC in it it qualifies as

780
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:48,560
him I always think that you know once

781
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,329
the big guys get playing they're just

782
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,049
gonna pay somebody to change that limit

783
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:56,059
you know from point four three to thirty

784
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:59,419
you know I saw it where I asked the

785
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:02,029
question someone who was in importation

786
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:05,120
years ago for fabric and I was like why

787
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:07,670
do you get the product from hungry and

788
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:10,519
they said because they can use cultivars

789
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:14,000
that have higher THC levels and we're

790
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:16,730
allowed and the production quantity per

791
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,380
square foot is increased

792
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,569
they said that you can't get what we

793
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,150
need as a production plant to give us a

794
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:24,859
profitable product that has that lower

795
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:28,220
THC percentage they didn't want the

796
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:31,579
cannabinoids they wanted the biomass to

797
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:34,370
do fabric and it was he was explaining

798
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:36,679
to me how us was not a hemp leader in

799
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:40,069
that because we weren't allowed to use

800
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:42,560
the plants that had too high of a THC

801
00:32:40,069 --> 00:32:44,689
level and he said for some reason the

802
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,909
plants that have the quality for fabric

803
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:49,039
are just over that amount and he said

804
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:51,320
and it just doesn't make sense to spend

805
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,000
so much time trying to hunt it back when

806
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:56,419
you could just go to Hungary and they

807
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,160
were pumping it out freely and I so it

808
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:01,250
for them it worked because they needed

809
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,870
it and I think that as time goes on you

810
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,759
know the US would do it too it's just

811
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:07,849
that in the way our model works it

812
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:08,960
always seems to favor the wealthy you

813
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:10,459
know and I think it hungry it was

814
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,620
because they want to have business in

815
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,180
general where they they needed

816
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:15,709
have this take place they needed it to

817
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,910
happen they said look if everybody's

818
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,590
making money it's okay because

819
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,720
somebody's better than no money on a

820
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:23,509
commercial industrial crop but to me the

821
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,160
u.s. is a different model and it's the

822
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:26,390
same situation is you know what when do

823
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:32,540
when do we start to kind of get this

824
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:34,820
together you for a few Graham what uh as

825
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:36,619
you're as you're looking forward what is

826
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:38,419
uh what's the what's uh what's a

827
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:39,199
direction you'd like to see yourself in

828
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,420
a couple years

829
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,910
they just let's just let's just all

830
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,259
pretend we're gonna make it cuz then

831
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,460
it's easy right otherwise it's like I

832
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:47,599
don't know if I'm gonna be here and I

833
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:50,420
always tell people that I said I'm gonna

834
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:52,699
be here or not it's brutal but the fact

835
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:54,529
is if I don't believe I'm gonna be here

836
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,000
then I can't do long-term planning which

837
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:57,769
you believed you're gonna be here

838
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,740
because you've been banking stock for a

839
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:02,210
long time what's uh what's something

840
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,650
you'd like to see in a couple years for

841
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:07,460
yourself well you know just personal

842
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:12,110
desire as a breeder as a collector as a

843
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:13,550
smoker cannabis culturalism so I'm

844
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:17,570
definitely gonna be in the game in a few

845
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:20,720
years I want to be still in Northern

846
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:24,129
California in Himmel triangle ideally if

847
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:26,869
I could stay here and make a living

848
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:30,619
providing seeds to the community that

849
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:31,759
would be my ideal so you know I know I

850
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:33,138
feel like I don't want to go either I

851
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,090
get asked to do a lot of international

852
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:37,730
work and if I was younger and I didn't

853
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:39,200
have family it wouldn't be bad but you

854
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:41,570
know tripping around the world to do

855
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,609
business as cool as it is it steals time

856
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:46,220
from your life and it's been it's been a

857
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:47,690
gift to be a you know live here and I

858
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:50,239
mean I get the same go to I just want to

859
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:52,820
be able to stay here and work on the

860
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,619
farm that I'm building and go into the

861
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,809
genetic material that I've sourced all

862
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,909
these years and be able to use that as

863
00:34:56,809 --> 00:35:00,799
trade to other people who have other

864
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:02,899
things that are I'm interested in so I

865
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,730
can start to continuously mind so that

866
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:08,440
you know the majority my life was spent

867
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,440
doing the work that I love doing

868
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,780
you got you got you got a farm you build

869
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,610
in yeah I own my farm and it's been I

870
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,940
mean for ten years I've been going after

871
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:25,680
this dream I have a dream and cannabis

872
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,050
has been you know big part of it but I

873
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,210
was able to buy a farm when I bought my

874
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:33,480
license and we have a son and I'm

875
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:35,220
married and yeah I would like to just be

876
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,750
doing a small farmer thing to be honest

877
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:38,730
that's my dream I'd love to have people

878
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:42,000
come out to my farm maybe on Saturday

879
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,619
buy some weed and some vegetables once

880
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,019
or twice a month in the summer do a big

881
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:48,059
dinner and like feed some people and

882
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:50,190
like showcase like I like to get into

883
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:52,920
stuff I love beer I love making beer I

884
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:55,050
love roasting coffee I actually want to

885
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,780
set up a tropical greenhouse I grow a

886
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:59,220
lot of lemons and stuff and just want to

887
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,870
get into care and me didn't like I'm

888
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:03,509
just a dork and I want to do that and I

889
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:05,309
kind of you know nothing big just like

890
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,750
just have fun and showcase what I like

891
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:09,269
to do and make enough money that I can

892
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,860
you know live a good life I'd ideally

893
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:20,070
like to only work 30 hours a week to be

894
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:23,370
honest you know next couple years where

895
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:25,019
do you see yourself going well develop

896
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:26,429
the farm here in Mendocino County and

897
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:28,769
want to move forward with the nursery on

898
00:36:26,429 --> 00:36:30,869
that and just mainly Rd but being able

899
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:33,630
to work with more the academic community

900
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:35,279
and like work like with Eleanor here

901
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,530
like the Canadore what they're doing

902
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,590
with this barium and starting to take

903
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:42,390
this initiative to actually like it's

904
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:44,640
almost like starting over again but

905
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:48,179
these are this is like that learning

906
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:49,409
process along the way and here in

907
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,750
California it's just

908
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:53,399
especially unlike these large Pinot

909
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,800
hunts and like with Matt it's like this

910
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,690
is something you know being able to work

911
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,340
on this on large scales and that's the

912
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,380
only thing that's limiting in California

913
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,690
right now and in the states is we need

914
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,119
the hundreds of acres with hundreds of

915
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:08,789
thousands of seeds and being able to do

916
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,099
these large selects or large populations

917
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:13,739
and at this time in California is rather

918
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:16,860
difficult so looking at other locations

919
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:21,629
to be able to do this and then bring the

920
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:23,610
seed back here so it's these new

921
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,900
discoveries they're out there you know

922
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,890
there's the white elephants and the

923
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,260
golden unicorn

924
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:31,139
and something there's a lot that we

925
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,730
still have to still out there and

926
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:34,889
especially these old strains are

927
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,090
starting to be reintroduced where people

928
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:37,379
are looking at it sort of like the

929
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,539
Grinspoon I don't know if you've ever

930
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,250
drone that one it's like just you're

931
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:43,170
looking at it's like why am i growing in

932
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,570
but it's such a special little plant and

933
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,340
what it has in it and it's like what

934
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,860
extracts and whatnot but it's something

935
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,510
that doesn't look the best why are you

936
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,539
growing this but it's like what's it got

937
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:56,070
inside you know that much that's if I

938
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:58,500
had like a multi-year dream it would be

939
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:00,030
that the population that buys cannabis

940
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,400
starts to really have a an understanding

941
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:04,019
of what they're buying so they can

942
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,610
actually start to have real product

943
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:07,730
differentiation and you can start to

944
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:09,809
have the subsets the sub markets create

945
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:11,610
to have you have individuals have

946
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:14,549
specialize in certain things so it lets

947
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:17,750
the farms work lines and develop the

948
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:20,610
ability to have true Appalachian like

949
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,500
standardization where in this region

950
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:24,900
these things have been sorted out to do

951
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,480
best and you can only get these things

952
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,190
in this region and it allows the regions

953
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,349
not to have to go head to head for who's

954
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,550
got the best gelato but each one of

955
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:35,429
these regions has something that's

956
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:39,390
uniquely distinct to that specific place

957
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:40,679
and what to me what it'll do is it allow

958
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:42,389
you to start to have you know true

959
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:43,949
long-term preservation because if we're

960
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:45,569
just the beginning of an industry and

961
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:47,730
when I look at liquor I'm like wow you

962
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:50,700
got 70 80 years you guys been sparking

963
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:52,050
up what are we gonna be doing in 80

964
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:53,669
years you know and if we can do the

965
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,870
building blocks of it now and start to

966
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,849
create some of that stuff you actually

967
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:58,559
have the tools to go forward because

968
00:38:56,849 --> 00:38:59,880
even though science takes over many

969
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:01,949
things there's always a Renaissance and

970
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,440
there's always outlaw there's always the

971
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:06,119
renegade that wants to buck that and do

972
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,530
it their own way and they're the ones

973
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,329
that always brought the wild shit

974
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:13,320
forward and that's what I hope to see

975
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:16,650
too about um

976
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,420
advice to collectors and breeders from

977
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:20,309
someone who's done a lot of work and

978
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,800
held a lot of work what do you recommend

979
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:25,559
to people for just how do you do it you

980
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,230
know on keeping clones is just don't

981
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:31,019
give up you know it's difficult

982
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:33,539
during you know moves and should it's

983
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:37,559
just you just got to keep the focus and

984
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:38,969
don't give up and always make sure your

985
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,549
cuts are routed before you take your

986
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:42,119
next

987
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:45,400
and sicker in the flowering room or

988
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:50,949
killer or whatever you're gonna do and

989
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:56,619
then as far as breeding just don't breed

990
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:59,500
with cookies breed with something that's

991
00:39:56,619 --> 00:40:02,969
true to your heart and try to bring

992
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,969
something different to the gene pool

993
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,500
question was you know um you know how do

994
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:14,829
you like for you you've maintained the

995
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,300
ATF for a long time and the the question

996
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:18,429
for people is like you know how did you

997
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,680
maintain it what's some advice you have

998
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:22,029
for people like when I'm someone who do

999
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:24,309
it was it does what I do which is hold

1000
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:26,019
libraries of time and movement area for

1001
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:28,509
time I always tell people redundant

1002
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:31,269
copies and make sure you give it to

1003
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:33,670
people that have an appreciation for

1004
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:35,769
that thing they're not big collectors

1005
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,930
they only want to hold one or two

1006
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:39,849
varietals because they will not lose

1007
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:42,399
them you give it to people who want a

1008
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:43,449
mass library that stuff gets lost and so

1009
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,190
I always tell people you gotta find

1010
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:47,169
people who care about the variety so

1011
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:50,050
much that all they want to do is hold

1012
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:51,789
that one variety and I've lost varieties

1013
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,920
for years and I've had people contact me

1014
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:55,630
and let me know man I'm just so happy

1015
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,610
with what I have and I go what do you

1016
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,410
got and they go the stuff you gave me

1017
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:02,140
all those years ago and I go you still

1018
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:06,309
got the stuff hmm and I realize I can

1019
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:08,619
remind that shaft and get those valuable

1020
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:10,090
goodies back out cuz I've lost them

1021
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:12,190
through for whatever you can only hold

1022
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:14,890
so much stuff and it's the redundant

1023
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:17,800
sharing and it's choosing who you have

1024
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:19,239
hold the plants people that just want

1025
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,850
everything don't have an appreciation

1026
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:23,409
they just want bulk collection and if

1027
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:25,389
you are a professional you bulk

1028
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:26,769
collections in a different form because

1029
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:29,230
usually have people to help you with it

1030
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:31,179
or a more stabilized infrastructure so

1031
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:33,789
you can keep it but for me if you want

1032
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:35,230
to hold a specific varietal for time get

1033
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:36,880
two or three people who just love that

1034
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,440
varietal and it's all they want to grow

1035
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,750
because that's what works for them and

1036
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,059
then what you have is a redundant bank

1037
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:45,460
in multiple locations of unconnected

1038
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:47,259
people so that you don't get caught up

1039
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,389
in a law enforcement Jam and you all

1040
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,349
lose your gear or you don't get caught

1041
00:41:49,389 --> 00:41:54,210
up in

1042
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:55,950
where it got lost because the person

1043
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:56,519
just didn't need it anymore so they got

1044
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:58,108
rid of it

1045
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:00,030
they wouldn't get rid of it because

1046
00:41:58,108 --> 00:42:01,679
that's what they use you know and so

1047
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,540
that's how I try to make sure I can keep

1048
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,909
material alive is to share it with

1049
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:08,608
individuals who have a commitment to the

1050
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:10,858
cut and then hopefully we can do some

1051
00:42:08,608 --> 00:42:12,449
kind of out cross or sell fit to hold

1052
00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:14,549
material so at least we have some

1053
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:17,009
genetic preservation of it but for you

1054
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:20,550
you held an ATF cut for a long time you

1055
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:23,730
know that was it I mean well you need

1056
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:26,880
though you kept it cuz of money you know

1057
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:28,980
it was like yeah we my buddy bought it

1058
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,318
for four thousand you know just for the

1059
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,880
cut back in the day and we were laughing

1060
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:34,199
at him you know and then we started

1061
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,579
making money on it you know is this

1062
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:37,529
three of us doing this little you know

1063
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:38,670
start out thing and we just kind of

1064
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,019
looked each other in the eyes said it

1065
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,619
you know it doesn't never go past the

1066
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:42,179
three of us

1067
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:44,760
and we kept it that way actually we

1068
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:46,529
agreed to give it to one other guy and

1069
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,059
he's the only one that held it after a

1070
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,500
while because we all you know ran it for

1071
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:51,599
years and years and it's kind of like

1072
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,059
alright they're sick you know I've been

1073
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,470
given this one dude ATF for five years

1074
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:57,960
and he's kind of getting sick of it you

1075
00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:59,848
know but we always it worked so anyways

1076
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,389
I had done some moving you know around

1077
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:04,710
and and I was able to get it back and it

1078
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:06,269
still does really well and so now I'm

1079
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,740
mad now I need to start like saving it

1080
00:43:06,269 --> 00:43:08,818
cuz I've realized the value and it you

1081
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:10,858
know it's kind of like one of those

1082
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:12,179
right next to me doing near the

1083
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:14,039
workhorse for me and I haven't really

1084
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:15,929
given it as much appreciation you know

1085
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:17,730
cuz I've I've been really excited about

1086
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:19,529
new things and kind of like you know

1087
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:21,179
going around but luckily I had some

1088
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,650
buddies that were just doing work just

1089
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:26,759
making money you know and so they didn't

1090
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:28,559
care they just you know but but as I've

1091
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,930
gotten into legalization and everything

1092
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,339
stable it's like when you were saying

1093
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:35,068
that man through the moves it was like

1094
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:37,078
oh god I'm so glad I don't have to move

1095
00:43:35,068 --> 00:43:40,048
again I'm so glad I can have as many

1096
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:42,030
damn plants as I want like it's a relief

1097
00:43:40,048 --> 00:43:43,949
because it's such a is very hard to move

1098
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,869
it's very hard to ship a clone it's all

1099
00:43:43,949 --> 00:43:48,719
this stuff is like you know people don't

1100
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:50,940
realize the you know it's hard

1101
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,429
especially because you in order for it

1102
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:55,289
to have any time in between tending you

1103
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:58,230
have to have it in a pot size big enough

1104
00:43:55,289 --> 00:44:00,389
or a system that has enough capacity to

1105
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:01,199
take care of it otherwise you're having

1106
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:03,969
to make sure that you're constantly

1107
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:06,669
doing it and if your life gets

1108
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:08,409
bumpy you end up coming home and seeing

1109
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:10,119
you know a racket that animal and you

1110
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:12,129
just like how that didn't work well

1111
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:13,900
that's honestly why I hit him up because

1112
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:15,309
I heard you know him rapping on some

1113
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,590
other stuff and I was just like man

1114
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:20,049
that's impressive like you got to be a

1115
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:22,450
solid grower some solid skills you gotta

1116
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:24,130
be really disciplined to like stock all

1117
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:26,289
that stuff and it's a service to the

1118
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,700
community like it's some you know thank

1119
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:30,389
you for like you know and unto others

1120
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:33,639
that like do that work in librarian yeah

1121
00:44:30,389 --> 00:44:34,629
ya know the librarians get and things I

1122
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:37,480
notice all the guys are the good

1123
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:39,280
librarians they're wary because

1124
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,510
everybody wants to borrow your books but

1125
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,160
they don't give a shit about bringing

1126
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:43,570
them back and they just want to take him

1127
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:45,730
and copy him and pull the cover off and

1128
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:47,559
put their own cover on it and then you

1129
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,000
want to give any any credit to the

1130
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:52,570
varietal itself so it's like a

1131
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,280
disrespect to the plant that did it I

1132
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:56,080
look at plants in some respects

1133
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,440
different because I I call this old a

1134
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,969
kay cut the cut that bought my house and

1135
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,590
whenever I look at my home I will always

1136
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:04,419
think of that plant because that was the

1137
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:08,050
plant that I used to buy the home I live

1138
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:11,680
in that plant was so valuable that I

1139
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:15,070
could generate enough funds from it to

1140
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,210
put a house that my kids live in and you

1141
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:17,080
have like a different emotional

1142
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,789
connection to it

1143
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:20,500
and when you see people just kicking it

1144
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:22,059
like it's you know a piece of trash you

1145
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,030
want to kick them in the ass yourself

1146
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:28,269
and that but that's what drives you to

1147
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:29,920
hold and keep for you you know are you

1148
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:31,869
are you doing a lot of bank and I know

1149
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,909
you've evolved in a tremendous amount of

1150
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:36,309
scientific work are you are you holding

1151
00:45:33,909 --> 00:45:38,259
stuff in in in vitro for I'm still you

1152
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:39,699
still hold the stuff yeah that's vitro

1153
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:43,380
right now it's the focus and that's

1154
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:45,759
working on that here that's we're on

1155
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,769
right now in Switzerland they're much

1156
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,000
more ahead even in Africa with what

1157
00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:50,409
they're doing it's like they're even

1158
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,489
taking males and putting them the

1159
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:55,629
library so we're going through and

1160
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:57,669
trying to keep our hands on everything

1161
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:00,070
right now and alive and it allows that

1162
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:03,099
to do that it's just being able to share

1163
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:07,000
that and the to this point what you're

1164
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:10,480
saying as well as this being responsible

1165
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,389
of carrying on that torch but giving the

1166
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,159
people that's worked with that to move

1167
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:15,639
it forward to where you have it and

1168
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:17,289
that's

1169
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,699
back to even like on some of this or

1170
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:20,920
these older strains it's like the

1171
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:22,960
indigenous people that like from Panama

1172
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,519
or you have the you know these different

1173
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,530
African scenes that were have been kept

1174
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:28,119
alive and then they're going in somebody

1175
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:30,370
else's hands who would when it was

1176
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:32,049
criminal it's like this sort of like

1177
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:34,210
with Neville and you know we look at the

1178
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,830
baseline of genetics and like Sam the

1179
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:37,929
skunk man and you go back to the Hayes

1180
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:39,429
brothers here and these genetics that

1181
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:42,250
originated here that went back to

1182
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:45,429
Amsterdam and then kind of have floated

1183
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:49,000
around but this basic gene pool this is

1184
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:51,069
what we're working with and to be able

1185
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,719
to share that information and know stuff

1186
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:54,010
like Neville like with what Jeannette

1187
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:57,489
you like with what you're working with

1188
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:59,350
these different old cultivars and being

1189
00:46:57,489 --> 00:47:02,799
able to share that as well because

1190
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:03,730
there's and this is like vitro is really

1191
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,950
good right now I know you've been

1192
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,659
working with it as well but the other

1193
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:11,019
thing with it as well as being able to

1194
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:13,690
transport the germ plasm you know yeah

1195
00:47:11,019 --> 00:47:16,030
yeah much more stable format yeah and in

1196
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:17,619
a much more efficient way to move it and

1197
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:20,440
I'm not sure about you know regulatory

1198
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:21,759
stuff but in terms of moving things in

1199
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:26,230
general it's always better when it's

1200
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,820
preserved protected and compact yeah and

1201
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:30,820
that's so that's something as in-vitro

1202
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:33,580
with experience right now they don't

1203
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:36,010
really question it as even you know it's

1204
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:37,360
so with shipping but with the right

1205
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:40,120
permits right now and that's what

1206
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:42,160
qualifying as hemp and doing your due

1207
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:44,079
diligence to have lab results right now

1208
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,059
then it's being able to share that and

1209
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,670
put it at different locations like

1210
00:47:46,059 --> 00:47:51,730
throughout the world and let somebody

1211
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:53,500
else propagate in different areas and

1212
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,780
that's something like in this area

1213
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,460
something from Mendocino that's

1214
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:59,440
performing well out on the coast that's

1215
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:02,829
really resilient but yet won't do well

1216
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,230
in the in you know in inland areas so

1217
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:08,920
it's like are you seeing are you seeing

1218
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:10,780
pockets of material in Africa that still

1219
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,940
goes back in time like that hasn't had

1220
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,730
the Dutch infiltration that see like

1221
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:19,599
when I when I was over in Hawaii in the

1222
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:21,730
in the mid 80s it was the last of the

1223
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:24,069
Southeast Asian varietals grown in the

1224
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:26,769
cane fields and so I go there and I get

1225
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:29,530
to experience some world-class cannabis

1226
00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:32,320
it was perfect because the soils the

1227
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:34,920
climate all matched up with those type

1228
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,900
of plants and so you had this incredible

1229
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,360
combination and then I go back you know

1230
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:42,309
years and years later and I got this uh

1231
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,380
this white kid that's telling me about

1232
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:46,150
you need to check out the aloha white

1233
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,289
widow and I was like that's not what I'm

1234
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:49,030
looking for I'm looking for the

1235
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:50,289
cambodian that used to grow out here

1236
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,460
that used to take top your head off make

1237
00:48:50,289 --> 00:48:54,429
you almost peed your pants he had a sit

1238
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:56,320
on the toilet smoked it where's that and

1239
00:48:54,429 --> 00:48:57,940
they're like oh no no you want the white

1240
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,890
widow and I'm like no I don't want the

1241
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,450
white widow I know at the white widows

1242
00:48:59,889 --> 00:49:02,199
like what I want is the things that were

1243
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:05,519
from here

1244
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:08,109
did did Africa have the ability to hold

1245
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:09,519
material in constant do you still have

1246
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:12,400
to look as someone who's discover in

1247
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:15,699
stock because to me I'm like Afghanistan

1248
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:18,309
got hammered all over Asia got hammered

1249
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:20,859
from war Africa had so much war and

1250
00:49:18,309 --> 00:49:22,659
famine and issues as your mining

1251
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:24,450
material you stable to mind some of that

1252
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:27,489
killeth stuff from the past or is it

1253
00:49:24,449 --> 00:49:29,049
it's getting polluted quickly it's it

1254
00:49:27,489 --> 00:49:30,879
really is it's hard to find like I was

1255
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,680
in this last year went to through

1256
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,890
Ethiopian than the Seychelles Islands

1257
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:37,389
right there and it's even finding these

1258
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,650
old land races where all of a sudden

1259
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:40,960
it's like oh these guys were here from

1260
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:44,200
Amsterdam a couple years ago and we have

1261
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,289
a white widow mango that we open

1262
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:49,239
pollinated with all our land race stuff

1263
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:50,710
so all of a sudden is this with what's

1264
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:51,099
happening is it's harder and harder to

1265
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:53,199
find

1266
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:54,429
from from Africa and that was years ago

1267
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:56,319
Southeast Asia

1268
00:49:54,429 --> 00:50:00,369
you know I traveled through Vietnam

1269
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:02,410
Cambodia Laos island area trying to and

1270
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:05,049
then even that was mid 90s and you're

1271
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:07,239
still running across places where people

1272
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:09,750
had brought other genetics in so this is

1273
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:12,279
one thing going back in this

1274
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:14,769
diversification and being able to keep

1275
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,230
things from there from the origin you

1276
00:50:14,769 --> 00:50:22,960
know in Southeast Asia India Africa and

1277
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:25,480
keep these genetics separate and being

1278
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,539
able to do to do testing and that's like

1279
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:30,340
the kind of the back step of documenting

1280
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:32,110
this but like yeah Africa it's it's

1281
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,930
anywhere in the world right now it's

1282
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:36,460
like Irian Jaya Papua New Guinea you're

1283
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:39,139
going there in these air

1284
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:43,730
people have been there with cannabis or

1285
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:46,190
him it's amazing because you know for me

1286
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:47,449
for my background from being in cannabis

1287
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:50,420
when it was coming over from all these

1288
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:52,159
places throughout the year in cycle it

1289
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:55,610
just let me experience a range of

1290
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:57,289
effects that I don't experience now I

1291
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:59,840
called most of the stuff we play with

1292
00:50:57,289 --> 00:51:01,639
now homogenized cannabis and what I want

1293
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:05,269
is I want to be able to have these

1294
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:10,670
unique directions to fit what I want to

1295
00:51:05,269 --> 00:51:11,750
do and how I want to feel and I people

1296
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,150
try to tell me that you know it's

1297
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:15,889
imagination that you're you're dreaming

1298
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:17,150
that things will better at that time and

1299
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:18,980
I said oh no they they had unbelievable

1300
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:21,200
effects and the directions were

1301
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,519
phenomenal and they were very unique in

1302
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,099
the way they sent on how you made you

1303
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:26,989
feel and you just you don't see this

1304
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:28,519
except in some very rare cultivar so we

1305
00:51:26,989 --> 00:51:30,379
see something it's highly marketable and

1306
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:31,489
a quality but like you know you're

1307
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,019
working with some of that stuff that

1308
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:36,649
panama's I remember some killer panama's

1309
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:38,480
that was just thumping and the the

1310
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:40,910
flavor profiles were unique in the way

1311
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,530
it made you feel was unique and the

1312
00:51:40,909 --> 00:51:44,329
problem is that as soon as we started to

1313
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,950
hybridize it down so that it would work

1314
00:51:44,329 --> 00:51:48,079
in our climax as soon as we started to

1315
00:51:45,949 --> 00:51:49,519
try to bring it in door we basically

1316
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,789
just started calling it out of existence

1317
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:55,519
and we dumbed it down do we turn the

1318
00:51:52,789 --> 00:51:56,449
qualities down and if you know for me

1319
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,039
when I try to get when I meet people

1320
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:59,210
that like you like I've known you for a

1321
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:00,559
long time but I know that you're you

1322
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:02,090
know you scouring the earth and I'm

1323
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,429
always like did you find some goodies

1324
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:06,950
someplace you know the goodies still

1325
00:52:04,429 --> 00:52:08,629
remaining somewhere and and and

1326
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:10,429
unfortunately the goodies are out there

1327
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:13,690
but they're just not market you know for

1328
00:52:10,429 --> 00:52:16,819
the most part but the some of these

1329
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:18,980
cultivars that take 14 weeks that the

1330
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:23,480
flower still 14 weeks is like a football

1331
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:25,219
and it hasn't filled in but but this is

1332
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,260
something that it's good to have in the

1333
00:52:25,219 --> 00:52:30,409
toolbox you know let's not get let's not

1334
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:32,900
get let this go and I think right now

1335
00:52:30,409 --> 00:52:35,149
that's these different unique cultivars

1336
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,519
that we run into it's keep it alive or

1337
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:38,510
share it with somebody else and you know

1338
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:41,259
it's like that

1339
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:43,460
it's that cannabinoids that feed your

1340
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:44,720
endocannabinoids you know everybody's

1341
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,050
different and that's that's the thing

1342
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,839
something that

1343
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:50,670
one strain it's like is that could be

1344
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,079
that key that helps you like with

1345
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:54,180
epilepsy it's three to five percent

1346
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,889
right of people that are affected by say

1347
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:58,919
Charlotte's Web but what are the

1348
00:52:55,889 --> 00:53:00,599
cannabinoids within that cultivar that

1349
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,849
are accessing your endocannabinoid

1350
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:05,940
profile and that's something collecting

1351
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:09,630
big data right now going into this on

1352
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:12,990
the pharmacogenetic level is identifying

1353
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:16,650
these genetics plant genetics and then a

1354
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:18,599
person's makeup and seeing that eighty

1355
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:22,220
year old lady that's in Australia that

1356
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:24,779
just got help from a certain profile and

1357
00:53:22,219 --> 00:53:26,189
helped her epilepsy epilepsy and then

1358
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:29,160
you have a three year old child in

1359
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:32,220
America or somewhere else that you'd

1360
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:33,719
never know that this particular balance

1361
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:35,699
of a one to one fight and that's

1362
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:37,980
something working one and was finding

1363
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:40,500
these old land races from from Africa as

1364
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,940
well but developing a full cannabinoid

1365
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:46,409
profile you know what I'm talking like

1366
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:50,460
five percent THC five CBD 5 CB n CB g CB

1367
00:53:46,409 --> 00:53:52,199
DV HCV flatlined across the board or

1368
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,539
these different profiles and then when

1369
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:56,909
you identify a cultivar like that being

1370
00:53:54,539 --> 00:54:01,829
able to put it in vitro and you put that

1371
00:53:56,909 --> 00:54:02,819
on the show so we're we're good on time

1372
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:03,349
we got a little bit time for some

1373
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,910
questions

1374
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:07,589
great great so you guys got some

1375
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:10,409
questions shoot him while you're here

1376
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:12,960
why did why did import weed stop coming

1377
00:54:10,409 --> 00:54:15,569
in the country import weed stopped

1378
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:18,420
coming in the country primarily because

1379
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:20,760
I was somebody that was involved in the

1380
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:24,360
enforcement of this and so what it was

1381
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:26,190
was it was a function of size and so

1382
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,440
when the people were shipping drugs into

1383
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:31,950
America and in Brown 1980 is when the

1384
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:34,019
door really got shut the the the

1385
00:54:31,949 --> 00:54:36,929
difficulty to ship a product into the

1386
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:39,059
u.s. became much more difficult and it

1387
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:41,699
is a lot easier to ship a suitcase full

1388
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:45,929
of cocaine than a truckload of cannabis

1389
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:47,399
and a suitcase full of opium is a lot

1390
00:54:45,929 --> 00:54:49,859
easier to ship than a truckload of

1391
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:53,190
cannabis and so it was a function of the

1392
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:55,950
economy and the us instantly kicked up

1393
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,250
its domestic production to make up for

1394
00:54:55,949 --> 00:54:58,409
it

1395
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,349
it's just that what we did is we lost

1396
00:54:58,409 --> 00:55:00,969
you know the

1397
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:03,639
cest a lot of these incredible type

1398
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:05,349
effects and highs and the tones that

1399
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:07,629
were there were also about the

1400
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:10,329
experiences you got when you smoked it

1401
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:12,400
and the people in the United States are

1402
00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:16,659
in their own paradigm America is its own

1403
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:18,150
little planet and so it just skewed it

1404
00:55:16,659 --> 00:55:20,349
and then after a couple of years

1405
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:21,849
basically nothing was coming in on any

1406
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:23,619
quantity it got to the point where

1407
00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:25,630
America was really jamming the whole

1408
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:27,309
Mexican drug trade because we were

1409
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:29,500
producing so much herb up here in in

1410
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:31,599
Northern California that it was really

1411
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:33,369
cutting back on the amount of money made

1412
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:36,009
in Mexico and if you talk to people in

1413
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:38,139
Mexico you can talk to villages and

1414
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:39,580
they're like oh man when they when you

1415
00:55:38,139 --> 00:55:41,980
guys started really lighting up heavy

1416
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:43,269
you financially broke us because we

1417
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,490
didn't realize that it wasn't just

1418
00:55:43,269 --> 00:55:47,889
cartels moving weed it was villages

1419
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:48,969
moving weed and that the cartel may have

1420
00:55:47,889 --> 00:55:51,639
been the trafficker

1421
00:55:48,969 --> 00:55:53,889
but the villager was the producer and so

1422
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:56,109
we started becoming competitors with the

1423
00:55:53,889 --> 00:55:57,940
Mexican farmer and we didn't really

1424
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:58,900
understand that for them it was life and

1425
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,599
death because they didn't have

1426
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:03,760
alternative forms of money the cannabis

1427
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:06,009
was their money you can't just come up

1428
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,100
growing weed and you also can't collect

1429
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:10,930
weed if you don't have a license you can

1430
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:12,789
only have six plants and so I always

1431
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:15,719
throw six plants out there for enjoyment

1432
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:18,610
but oh my god how the hell do you bank

1433
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:20,139
varietals for time and breed and

1434
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:22,180
reproduce when you're only legally

1435
00:56:20,139 --> 00:56:25,210
allowed sex and so it forces everyone to

1436
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:26,079
go right back into a criminal status and

1437
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:28,360
someone's like yeah it's only a

1438
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:30,299
misdemeanor but I'm like the point is

1439
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,530
that it's still a criminal status and

1440
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,539
you get would get your product seized

1441
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:36,190
and so you don't have an ability to hold

1442
00:56:34,539 --> 00:56:38,349
a living collection unless you have a

1443
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:44,650
permit and for most people man that's no

1444
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:46,630
small trick answer question right he's

1445
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:48,099
asking what's the major differences

1446
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:50,500
between the Northern Lights cuts you

1447
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:53,440
hold because they're all named numerix

1448
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:56,730
what's the significance of that and what

1449
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,730
does it mean to you and how you use them

1450
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:04,990
so that's a very good question so we

1451
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,639
would really need the guys here that

1452
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:07,989
originally bred the Northern Lights

1453
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:10,250
strains to answer all these questions

1454
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:13,039
but from what I've

1455
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:16,030
from read and understand and what I've

1456
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:18,889
heard through the cannabis culture is

1457
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:26,210
Northern Lights number one is the pure

1458
00:57:18,889 --> 00:57:28,789
form two three we're crossed indicas NL

1459
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:34,220
five six seven eight nine were crossed

1460
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:37,029
uh sativas to hybridize NL five has the

1461
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:43,098
best bagged peel and the best marketable

1462
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:48,940
bud NL two has the strongest most indica

1463
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:53,090
a lot of Juniper just real cush smell

1464
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:54,950
Northern Lights number one is the

1465
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:57,710
backbone of all the other ones you can

1466
00:57:54,949 --> 00:58:02,509
smell it in there it was the building

1467
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:04,400
block it's what Neville used if he had a

1468
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:06,650
clone and he wanted to recreate that

1469
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,660
clone he that was the male he used when

1470
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:11,809
he wanted to make a pure hash plant off

1471
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:13,909
the hash plant cutting he back crossed

1472
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:17,389
off of the Northern Lights number one

1473
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:19,519
when he wanted to bring Big Bud to the

1474
00:58:17,389 --> 00:58:21,650
market and he just had the Big Bud clone

1475
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:25,369
he back crossed off of Northern Lights

1476
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:28,460
number one sin it's a real building

1477
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:32,890
block as far as it by itself it's great

1478
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:32,889
smoke but it doesn't have the bag appeal

1479
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:43,160
that's your question thanks man

1480
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:45,200
any other questions yeah you saying how

1481
00:58:43,159 --> 00:58:49,549
do you go from bag appeal to smoke

1482
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:52,399
appeal in actual reality and and and

1483
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:53,900
where everyone screams education but if

1484
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,320
you want to get an education in America

1485
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:59,450
you're gonna go broke so the the issue

1486
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,890
with education in our situation is to be

1487
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:03,529
able to have some loosening of the

1488
00:59:00,889 --> 00:59:06,379
regulation that allows you to have

1489
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:08,930
events where individuals can come and

1490
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:10,579
meet cultivators and then cultivators

1491
00:59:08,929 --> 00:59:12,980
can then be able to sit down and

1492
00:59:10,579 --> 00:59:15,380
casually without trying to sell them

1493
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:17,900
product expose them to what they have

1494
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:20,838
and then they can also explain to them

1495
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:22,200
why they like it whereas it shine most

1496
00:59:20,838 --> 00:59:24,570
people whose

1497
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:25,919
smug you remember most people nowadays

1498
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:28,860
can't roll the joint

1499
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,869
I sell cone rollers and stuff and I

1500
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:32,160
personally don't like a filter so I'm

1501
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:33,960
somebody who likes to taste the weed in

1502
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:36,059
his mouth so cardboard in the mouth just

1503
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,760
doesn't do it it's for me the same way

1504
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:41,340
but that's because that's what I know

1505
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,480
but I realized that nobody can roll a

1506
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:45,840
joint anymore

1507
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:48,900
they they they use devices to smoke and

1508
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:50,460
when you're using a bong or glass and

1509
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,630
you're torching it with the lighter and

1510
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,789
you're burning that shit

1511
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:56,309
burn ability is an issue but when you're

1512
00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:58,880
smoking it in a tube it's definitely an

1513
00:59:56,309 --> 01:00:01,170
issue and that's where the pre-rolls

1514
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,390
people don't have issues because by the

1515
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:05,579
time you smoke it it's dry so the

1516
01:00:03,389 --> 01:00:08,369
combust ability is incredible but you're

1517
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:11,519
lacking the quality of flavor and so

1518
01:00:08,369 --> 01:00:13,519
there's this this reality of why are you

1519
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:16,259
putting the product on the market and

1520
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:20,039
the people who buy the product have to

1521
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:21,930
understand this is the truth that these

1522
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:24,570
things are on the Martin same thing when

1523
01:00:21,929 --> 01:00:27,389
you explain to people why the tomato is

1524
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:30,900
on the table because it fits in a lug

1525
01:00:27,389 --> 01:00:33,420
and why does the Cavendish banana sold

1526
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,650
compared to other bananas because low

1527
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,349
and behold it doesn't need refrigeration

1528
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:40,320
when you ship it it tastes good enough

1529
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:42,869
and it doesn't require refrigeration so

1530
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:45,720
those financial concerns dictate the

1531
01:00:42,869 --> 01:00:47,579
consumption reality and when people say

1532
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:48,869
education people like all people are

1533
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:50,489
gonna be doing the education I'm like

1534
01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:51,839
yeah people who trying to bank money who

1535
01:00:50,489 --> 01:00:54,989
don't know what they're doing when I see

1536
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:57,690
people in Napa running terpene seminars

1537
01:00:54,989 --> 01:00:59,909
and and all I'm looking at I'm like

1538
01:00:57,690 --> 01:01:02,340
Romeo joint and now that doesn't mean

1539
01:00:59,909 --> 01:01:04,889
you're legit but if you can't even break

1540
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:07,050
up some weed the amount of weed you've

1541
01:01:04,889 --> 01:01:09,719
handled in your life is probably pretty

1542
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:11,960
small so you're the last person I'm

1543
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:14,639
gonna ask for for an in-person

1544
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:17,039
demonstration I appreciate cannabis you

1545
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:19,379
might be an incredible scientist and you

1546
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:21,719
can explain to me why I get the response

1547
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:23,579
and reaction I do from what I'm doing

1548
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:26,609
but you're not the one I'm asking for

1549
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:28,079
turn me on to grass and that's what we

1550
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:30,510
need is we need people like yourselves

1551
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,369
that are Korea smokers Korea growers who

1552
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:32,620
can appreciate quality and you can sit

1553
01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:35,139
down

1554
01:01:32,619 --> 01:01:37,989
with customers in a cannabis manner

1555
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:39,759
which is non-aggressive and let him try

1556
01:01:37,989 --> 01:01:41,319
it and then you can say let's see this

1557
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,570
is nuggie and it works and we sell it

1558
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:46,600
for this but personally we smoke this

1559
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:48,490
loser looking hay like weed because for

1560
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:51,519
me that you know the the quality the

1561
01:01:48,489 --> 01:01:53,769
high isn't is is perfect and they go how

1562
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:55,179
do i buy stuff like that and then you go

1563
01:01:53,769 --> 01:01:57,159
right now we need to figure out how do

1564
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:58,690
we get it to you and that's try to work

1565
01:01:57,159 --> 01:02:00,159
out the supply chain like we talked

1566
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:02,110
about this morning but once you get

1567
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,929
customers that want your product you're

1568
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:06,789
no longer pushing drugs they are pulling

1569
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:10,319
drugs and there's a radical difference

1570
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:13,119
in business velocity when that happens

1571
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:14,950
I'm asking Bob some good questions

1572
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:19,389
I was calling bob says his nickname

1573
01:02:14,949 --> 01:02:21,939
everybody had a nickname I I always

1574
01:02:19,389 --> 01:02:24,219
fascinated with when I met him he was

1575
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:26,860
somebody who was explaining to me the

1576
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:29,439
varieties he held and he was going

1577
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:31,150
through the chain of custody in a manner

1578
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,220
that made me laugh and I said how the

1579
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:36,970
fuck do you remember that many names who

1580
01:02:33,219 --> 01:02:39,279
held it because it was so conscientious

1581
01:02:36,969 --> 01:02:41,409
and that's why when I was saying to him

1582
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,120
how do you hold material because it's

1583
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:44,889
it's these little things I notice in

1584
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:48,609
people that I don't think other people

1585
01:02:44,889 --> 01:02:51,190
understand about what drives you to do

1586
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:53,380
it and what level of desire and fatah

1587
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:55,300
you know humble guy fantastic and highly

1588
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:57,369
knowledgeable gardener in a market

1589
01:02:55,300 --> 01:03:00,220
that's insane and I wanted him to be

1590
01:02:57,369 --> 01:03:01,869
able to explain you know how do you

1591
01:03:00,219 --> 01:03:04,989
integrate those worlds because he's a

1592
01:03:01,869 --> 01:03:06,339
superior farmer and for hearty it's the

1593
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:09,250
questions that I wanted to get out of

1594
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:11,980
him were you know using your knowledge

1595
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:13,929
of the current scientific situation in

1596
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:17,230
the global situation what's your

1597
01:03:13,929 --> 01:03:18,669
thoughts on it and from that point man

1598
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:21,099
there's a trillion questions you could

1599
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:22,750
ask and so shit I mean I think we

1600
01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:24,099
covered what I wanted to see the

1601
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:26,440
question is there something that you

1602
01:03:24,099 --> 01:03:28,690
want to know you know is there something

1603
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:30,159
you feel that you could ask any one of

1604
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:32,409
these people to get a little bit of

1605
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:34,529
direction and that's really the truth of

1606
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:34,529
it

1607
01:03:36,548 --> 01:03:44,509
you've done a lot of research from all

1608
01:03:42,228 --> 01:03:56,419
around the world what have you found

1609
01:03:44,509 --> 01:04:00,139
most recent research different that's

1610
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:01,309
the Varens through there was you know I

1611
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:04,458
don't know if you're familiar with

1612
01:04:01,309 --> 01:04:06,680
Doug's baron and then finding the you

1613
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:11,598
know this this lineage of where it came

1614
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:14,419
from and then and bringing that bringing

1615
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:17,539
that out that's a particular strain

1616
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:21,019
though that is not appealing as well so

1617
01:04:17,539 --> 01:04:24,680
it's been one that has taken a lot of

1618
01:04:21,018 --> 01:04:28,308
time and money and patience to move it

1619
01:04:24,679 --> 01:04:31,098
forward and it has moved forward in like

1620
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:33,769
when you see a two to three percent gain

1621
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:35,719
in those cannabinoids it seems like it's

1622
01:04:33,768 --> 01:04:38,268
been significant with the with the

1623
01:04:35,719 --> 01:04:40,278
Varens more so than THC being able to

1624
01:04:38,268 --> 01:04:42,978
take something in a couple back crosses

1625
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:46,159
we're getting it up to above 20% and

1626
01:04:42,978 --> 01:04:48,078
these desirable terpenes but yeah to

1627
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:52,449
that point it's the the Barons that

1628
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:55,930
we've been looking at to increase eight

1629
01:04:52,449 --> 01:04:59,959
right now so it's getting that over that

1630
01:04:55,929 --> 01:05:01,818
10% right there and it's it's yeah and

1631
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:03,108
it's a lot of testing you know this is

1632
01:05:01,818 --> 01:05:06,018
something it's so you can have that same

1633
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:08,298
phenotype and that same expression in

1634
01:05:06,018 --> 01:05:10,698
something you know back crossed up to

1635
01:05:08,298 --> 01:05:12,588
even we've seen you know as far as what

1636
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:15,499
the variance is you know you're going to

1637
01:05:12,588 --> 01:05:19,400
six generations and while of a son out

1638
01:05:15,498 --> 01:05:21,259
of a hundred tests do you see these all

1639
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:24,199
of a sudden you see an outlier spike

1640
01:05:21,259 --> 01:05:25,759
where it's going up above even 1% 2% and

1641
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:28,999
then they're these outliers that will

1642
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:30,708
shoot up to above over 5 and then it's

1643
01:05:28,998 --> 01:05:35,629
how many tests we have to run before we

1644
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:37,639
get that 10 do you see when you're went

1645
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:39,259
I've noticed sometimes it when we're

1646
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:41,028
looking for specific cannabinoids and

1647
01:05:39,259 --> 01:05:43,009
we're trying to run them there seems to

1648
01:05:41,028 --> 01:05:45,139
be a blockage from other cannabinoids

1649
01:05:43,009 --> 01:05:47,358
it's almost like the plants competing

1650
01:05:45,139 --> 01:05:48,219
with what it's going to produce and so

1651
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:50,799
when you're

1652
01:05:48,219 --> 01:05:53,348
you're working with th cv which is just

1653
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,730
so trendy right now are you seeing into

1654
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:57,280
relationships with other other

1655
01:05:54,730 --> 01:06:00,849
cannabinoids that our linkage like drag

1656
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:03,220
or if you see another cannabinoid do you

1657
01:06:00,849 --> 01:06:05,200
notice that it stops the production of

1658
01:06:03,219 --> 01:06:06,848
THC v like we know there's limits of

1659
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:09,939
what can be for me other than the within

1660
01:06:06,849 --> 01:06:12,550
the cookbook yeah you know and you have

1661
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:15,250
to that to that point is that seeing

1662
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:17,109
that the with the THC v is as well the

1663
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:21,039
spikes in THC as well so it's

1664
01:06:17,108 --> 01:06:23,079
identifying and that those particular

1665
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:25,090
high th C's and then all of a sudden

1666
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:27,608
you'll see completely CBD completely

1667
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:30,099
knocked out alt altogether and that's

1668
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:32,199
right now it's being able to put that in

1669
01:06:30,099 --> 01:06:34,330
a controlled growing environment because

1670
01:06:32,199 --> 01:06:36,789
how much do you know this is something

1671
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:40,329
as these environmental conditions at

1672
01:06:36,789 --> 01:06:47,050
what point is that is that as well being

1673
01:06:40,329 --> 01:07:06,789
attributed to to that makeup get one

1674
01:06:47,050 --> 01:07:08,619
question sit down well as far as CBD

1675
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:10,420
goes I know if you can get a more fungal

1676
01:07:08,619 --> 01:07:11,320
dominated soil you're gonna get a higher

1677
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:13,329
test result

1678
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:15,550
does that help is that what you were

1679
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:42,069
looking for

1680
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:43,510
I I haven't done that but yeah well I

1681
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:44,950
was just gonna like just kind of

1682
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:46,510
reinforce as what you're saying that it

1683
01:07:44,949 --> 01:07:48,969
that that does exist you know like

1684
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:50,170
people that taste my weed and and I'm

1685
01:07:48,969 --> 01:07:51,579
not saying this is necessarily a good

1686
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:52,840
thing but I've been using a lot of the

1687
01:07:51,579 --> 01:07:54,069
same mixes for a long time and they

1688
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:58,240
always say you're all your weeds tastes

1689
01:07:54,070 --> 01:08:00,610
real similar deal and um I think it's a

1690
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:02,889
bit bit mix like what I'm putting in

1691
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:05,410
there in put wise it's a bit environment

1692
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:08,650
it's a bit like my biome that's I guess

1693
01:08:05,409 --> 01:08:10,059
the part that I wanted to put up you

1694
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:12,220
know I'm touching the plants I'm

1695
01:08:10,059 --> 01:08:13,779
touching the soil the guy I learned to

1696
01:08:12,219 --> 01:08:16,210
grow from he taught me how to mix and

1697
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:18,280
he's he goes you're sweating good and he

1698
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:20,020
goes shake that shit off he made me

1699
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:22,179
shake my drips off and I think about it

1700
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:23,710
every time I mix in soil that the sweats

1701
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:25,298
going in there and that's gonna taste

1702
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:26,859
you know somebody it's kind of gross

1703
01:08:25,298 --> 01:08:28,750
when you think about it but somebody's

1704
01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:30,280
gonna taste that down the road and that

1705
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:34,060
it's leaving an impression and you know

1706
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:35,710
and my what's going on with me is is

1707
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:38,798
what's going on with my microbes to my

1708
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:40,659
emotions my life and I've you know it's

1709
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:42,338
a little bit weird whatever I always try

1710
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:44,289
to approach my gardens with the clear

1711
01:08:42,338 --> 01:08:46,989
head if I have to stop and smoke a joint

1712
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:48,939
take a walk I don't always do it but

1713
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:53,619
I've always tried to put little signs

1714
01:08:48,939 --> 01:08:56,139
and stuff to remind me like I never work

1715
01:08:53,619 --> 01:09:00,130
angry when I work on the plants I think

1716
01:08:56,140 --> 01:09:02,588
that really does I chill because you you

1717
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:04,930
are rough it's like with your kids you

1718
01:09:02,588 --> 01:09:06,760
deal with your children you need to make

1719
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:08,230
sure that you turn down your personal

1720
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:11,130
shit with any decision you make with

1721
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:13,989
them because otherwise your harsh and

1722
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:15,730
that impact on them is tremendous

1723
01:09:13,989 --> 01:09:17,229
because they're sensitive and I look at

1724
01:09:15,729 --> 01:09:18,219
plants the same way and I just tell

1725
01:09:17,229 --> 01:09:21,219
people that's why that's why I love

1726
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:24,699
cannabis because it slows me down I

1727
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:27,159
can't be aggressive I can't be hurried

1728
01:09:24,699 --> 01:09:27,748
or rushed I have to move at the plants

1729
01:09:27,159 --> 01:09:29,880
pace

1730
01:09:27,748 --> 01:09:32,838
and I think that that changed the way I

1731
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:35,130
perceive life they let me understand a

1732
01:09:32,838 --> 01:09:37,048
natural progression that things can only

1733
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:39,809
move at the pace they do and when you

1734
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:43,439
try to go past that you miss things and

1735
01:09:39,809 --> 01:09:47,309
you cause problems and so I agree man I

1736
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:48,988
turned down my my drama when your when

1737
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:51,449
your monkey brain or whatever they call

1738
01:09:48,988 --> 01:09:55,319
it like everything breaks around you you

1739
01:09:51,448 --> 01:09:58,018
you know you're just you know it's like

1740
01:09:55,319 --> 01:10:00,509
you just causing more problems by being

1741
01:09:58,019 --> 01:10:05,550
in that space you know so I don't know

1742
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:07,530
do you have any testing minimum it's

1743
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:09,900
it's um it's almost putting taking

1744
01:10:07,529 --> 01:10:13,738
inputs out is something like the last

1745
01:10:09,899 --> 01:10:16,710
couple is helpful with breeding how far

1746
01:10:13,738 --> 01:10:18,419
can you push a plant to stress for like

1747
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:19,979
dry farming for instance have you seen a

1748
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,569
lot with that all of a sudden you just

1749
01:10:19,979 --> 01:10:23,969
pull the water off pull the plant off

1750
01:10:21,569 --> 01:10:25,710
water and have it like it just all of a

1751
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:28,948
sudden it does it doesn't fill up but

1752
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:30,748
the the flower the way it changes in

1753
01:10:28,948 --> 01:10:33,299
that and the terpenes within it so it's

1754
01:10:30,748 --> 01:10:36,149
really taking as much as possible out of

1755
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:40,288
the plant as far as input and seeing its

1756
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:41,879
performance and and because some plants

1757
01:10:40,288 --> 01:10:44,340
will just they won't they can't handle

1758
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:46,078
it they're gone so just move through on

1759
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,578
to the next and some of these ones that

1760
01:10:46,078 --> 01:10:50,158
are really vigorous and then you can

1761
01:10:47,578 --> 01:10:51,988
we've taken these vigorous plants and

1762
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:53,848
then put them in a greenhouse that's got

1763
01:10:51,988 --> 01:10:56,218
you know that's got mites but it's got

1764
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:57,960
bugs so it's got p.m. throw it next to

1765
01:10:56,219 --> 01:10:59,788
these plants how does it perform is it

1766
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,739
getting these diseases some of them that

1767
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:02,609
don't pull them back outside and keep

1768
01:11:01,738 --> 01:11:05,189
working with that

1769
01:11:02,609 --> 01:11:07,170
how much duress and stress can be put on

1770
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:08,399
the plant and see good performance and

1771
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:10,408
that's like looking at it from an

1772
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:12,388
athlete's point and then when you give

1773
01:11:10,408 --> 01:11:13,948
it a little input it's kind of bringing

1774
01:11:12,389 --> 01:11:15,150
it back down and taking everything out

1775
01:11:13,948 --> 01:11:18,118
of it and then when you give it a little

1776
01:11:15,149 --> 01:11:19,978
you know couples pellets of you know

1777
01:11:18,118 --> 01:11:23,988
seabird guano or whatever it may be that

1778
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:23,989
fertilizer than you watch that change

1779
01:11:32,529 --> 01:11:45,559
Strawberry Cough yeah that's a deep

1780
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:46,699
question for me it would be something

1781
01:11:45,559 --> 01:11:48,829
that no one in the cannabis community

1782
01:11:46,698 --> 01:11:52,669
knows it's just the rapture

1783
01:11:48,828 --> 01:11:55,368
it's an old NL g13 house playing across

1784
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:56,960
from North Carolina the question was

1785
01:11:55,368 --> 01:12:00,618
what do you regret losing the most I

1786
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:03,429
lost a plant that would have come out of

1787
01:12:00,618 --> 01:12:06,649
like the late 80s out of riceland and

1788
01:12:03,429 --> 01:12:10,069
when you lit it it looked like a burning

1789
01:12:06,649 --> 01:12:11,689
tire and I got so high when I smoked it

1790
01:12:10,069 --> 01:12:13,279
that I'd lay down on the couch and my

1791
01:12:11,689 --> 01:12:14,779
girl would come in and I'd wake up and

1792
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:16,670
she'd be wiping my face with the rag

1793
01:12:14,779 --> 01:12:18,979
asking me if I was sick because I was

1794
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:23,649
feverish and I would mumble and I'm just

1795
01:12:18,979 --> 01:12:26,299
really high and it had the most complete

1796
01:12:23,649 --> 01:12:29,299
effect I've ever experienced then it was

1797
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:33,639
stunning cannabis in every aspect it had

1798
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:37,070
a visual quality it had growth quality

1799
01:12:33,639 --> 01:12:42,739
it had a quality a high that was unreal

1800
01:12:37,069 --> 01:12:44,509
and it got killed by mistake and I said

1801
01:12:42,738 --> 01:12:46,578
I'll we'll go find more like that but I

1802
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:49,820
realized quickly that that was a memory

1803
01:12:46,578 --> 01:12:52,578
and that was the one I wish I had back

1804
01:12:49,819 --> 01:12:55,039
more than anyone it was so green it was

1805
01:12:52,578 --> 01:12:57,259
almost like blue and ice the cold like

1806
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:59,328
you know like a blue varietal but it

1807
01:12:57,260 --> 01:13:01,460
literally would make regular people ill

1808
01:12:59,328 --> 01:13:04,250
they would it would it would fold you

1809
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:05,658
over and and kick you in the ass and

1810
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:07,569
send you home and say come back when

1811
01:13:05,658 --> 01:13:10,399
you're grown up

1812
01:13:07,569 --> 01:13:12,590
the beauty of cannabis is that all of us

1813
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:14,149
have that special thing and that's why

1814
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:15,770
I've always been trying to explain to

1815
01:13:14,149 --> 01:13:17,629
people you don't have to be a big banker

1816
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:19,219
but you got to bank a little bit you got

1817
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:20,539
to make sure you keep some stock you got

1818
01:13:19,219 --> 01:13:22,880
to make sure you're involved in some

1819
01:13:20,539 --> 01:13:25,460
breeding don't let anybody talk shit to

1820
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:27,469
you because your pollen chucker you're

1821
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:29,328
somebody who has historically done what

1822
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:31,099
we've done since the dawn of time you've

1823
01:13:29,328 --> 01:13:34,039
chosen things to put together for your

1824
01:13:31,099 --> 01:13:35,989
desire and when people ask me you know

1825
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:38,059
what should I smoke I'm like I'm not

1826
01:13:35,988 --> 01:13:40,819
qualified to tell you because I'm not

1827
01:13:38,059 --> 01:13:42,590
you I can put you into things and I can

1828
01:13:40,819 --> 01:13:43,038
help you understand why you like it but

1829
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:45,590
front of

1830
01:13:43,038 --> 01:13:46,518
I'm not you I'm not qualified to tell

1831
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:48,769
you what you should like it's like

1832
01:13:46,519 --> 01:13:53,030
telling someone who they should love you

1833
01:13:48,769 --> 01:13:54,739
know qualified what you you what you I

1834
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:56,420
know you lost something good man you've

1835
01:13:54,738 --> 01:14:03,078
had a lot of stuff in your hand boy oh

1836
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:05,239
yeah and that's where you come in with

1837
01:14:03,078 --> 01:14:07,670
the sharing and it's like I being a

1838
01:14:05,238 --> 01:14:09,078
being breeding seeds and taking these

1839
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:11,630
times it's like they're your children

1840
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:13,578
and it's like that's like the one thing

1841
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:15,559
it's like spreading that right now and

1842
01:14:13,578 --> 01:14:19,639
it was like back in the you know the

1843
01:14:15,559 --> 01:14:21,590
early 90s and and running into walls and

1844
01:14:19,639 --> 01:14:24,319
and getting losing these certain

1845
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:26,029
genetics and that's like what was drove

1846
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:27,828
me back to go to like Southeast Asia

1847
01:14:26,029 --> 01:14:29,059
it's like finding this you know that was

1848
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:30,500
happy pizzas I don't know if you've been

1849
01:14:29,059 --> 01:14:32,599
to Cambodia but you eat this fucking

1850
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:34,038
pizza and you're tripping you know

1851
01:14:32,599 --> 01:14:37,460
you're you're in Cambodia on the end

1852
01:14:34,038 --> 01:14:39,920
there's this different level to that and

1853
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:41,868
this was something when you could grow

1854
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,730
this and it was a nice producer it would

1855
01:14:41,868 --> 01:14:45,500
grow under the manzanita as well here

1856
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:47,000
and you could put it in a mixed bag of

1857
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:49,939
tricks and get fifty six hundred a pound

1858
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,519
for it it had different colors it wasn't

1859
01:14:49,939 --> 01:14:54,939
that name but that's like these some old

1860
01:14:52,519 --> 01:14:58,010
South East Asian you know these these

1861
01:14:54,939 --> 01:15:01,368
long flowering times but just the

1862
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:03,289
soaring psychedelic highs and that

1863
01:15:01,368 --> 01:15:07,518
different feeling and that's part of

1864
01:15:03,288 --> 01:15:09,768
that backtracking and finding what

1865
01:15:07,519 --> 01:15:11,989
exactly like one of them with CBD it was

1866
01:15:09,769 --> 01:15:14,150
reaching out to you know with Ringo and

1867
01:15:11,988 --> 01:15:16,308
like Jaime when this was when people

1868
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:18,738
were first introducing that you know the

1869
01:15:16,309 --> 01:15:21,349
1e telegram osa and that you know that

1870
01:15:18,738 --> 01:15:23,598
canna tonic those old genetics and it's

1871
01:15:21,349 --> 01:15:25,788
like okay well this was Oaxaca this

1872
01:15:23,599 --> 01:15:28,010
region Colombia you know where were

1873
01:15:25,788 --> 01:15:30,529
these things coming from and then trying

1874
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:32,059
to search those out and that's like when

1875
01:15:30,529 --> 01:15:34,939
you mention that with Africa what's is

1876
01:15:32,059 --> 01:15:37,070
getting is we're losing this you know

1877
01:15:34,939 --> 01:15:39,229
these unique ones that are out there and

1878
01:15:37,069 --> 01:15:41,779
it's being able to find these special

1879
01:15:39,229 --> 01:15:43,129
ones but at what point we we you want to

1880
01:15:41,779 --> 01:15:45,109
share these but you don't want them to

1881
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:46,819
go under the wrong hands and that's

1882
01:15:45,109 --> 01:15:49,009
something we're gonna be facing right

1883
01:15:46,819 --> 01:15:52,639
now being breeders I think coming more

1884
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:54,369
and more as we've got the bigger players

1885
01:15:52,639 --> 01:15:57,310
that are coming in and

1886
01:15:54,368 --> 01:15:58,809
just they don't realize the time and the

1887
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:01,000
energy that's put into these certain

1888
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:03,909
cultivars and how rare and special they

1889
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:11,109
are and that that's something that we

1890
01:16:03,908 --> 01:16:13,210
have to protect drew drew Strawberry

1891
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:16,269
Cough I lost that I had right away and I

1892
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:18,399
thought about it a lot like my pops and

1893
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:21,310
beans and I haven't found anything it

1894
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:22,868
was it was that I'm pretty sure it was

1895
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:24,969
the Strawberry Cough because I've seen

1896
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:27,279
the COFF and it had that you know that's

1897
01:16:24,969 --> 01:16:30,908
very distinguished like real thick smoke

1898
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:32,109
you know but it was the first plant that

1899
01:16:30,908 --> 01:16:34,960
we ever I remember going to did to

1900
01:16:32,109 --> 01:16:38,019
plants under two lights and we got six

1901
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:39,340
pounds and we were like it was like

1902
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:41,650
blown away the first time that ever

1903
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:43,810
happened and it was very easy to trim

1904
01:16:41,649 --> 01:16:45,609
just these little golf ball nugs which

1905
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:47,409
most the COFF is not in the Strawberry

1906
01:16:45,609 --> 01:16:49,658
Cough it's his bigger you know denser

1907
01:16:47,408 --> 01:16:51,039
fluffier but it was really anyways and

1908
01:16:49,658 --> 01:16:54,368
it was it was really because I was

1909
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:56,829
medicine for me I came into cannabis

1910
01:16:54,368 --> 01:16:58,929
from a bicycle accident and so I was

1911
01:16:56,829 --> 01:17:00,429
fucked up I got hit by a car I was

1912
01:16:58,929 --> 01:17:02,980
fucked up really hard for a couple years

1913
01:17:00,429 --> 01:17:04,868
and just like learning to grow weed

1914
01:17:02,979 --> 01:17:06,098
walking around the house smoking as much

1915
01:17:04,868 --> 01:17:08,859
weed as I could and it was that

1916
01:17:06,099 --> 01:17:12,190
Strawberry Cough that like really was

1917
01:17:08,859 --> 01:17:14,259
able to help me manage so it was a damn

1918
01:17:12,189 --> 01:17:16,089
sharks breath that I lost it to I got

1919
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:18,579
stuck with the shark wreck cutting and I

1920
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:20,050
hated that thing and as I took a cut I

1921
01:17:18,579 --> 01:17:21,550
thought it was a strawberry and I messed

1922
01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:22,779
it up and it was a shark's breath and I

1923
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:29,250
could never get rid of that fucking

1924
01:17:22,779 --> 01:17:31,029
plant all right Manny I just want to say

1925
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:34,420
thanks for taking the time to spend the

1926
01:17:31,029 --> 01:17:37,029

you all as an audience and I would love

1928
01:17:37,029 --> 01:17:42,359
to have you give a hand to the

1929
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:42,359
individuals that put this together

1930
01:17:48,578 --> 01:17:53,090
and give a salute to yourself to man

1931

01:17:56,389 --> 01:17:59,479

didn't give up during a lot of hard

1936
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:04,729
times and you didn't give up under the

1937
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:07,010
oppression that's occurring and that's a

1938
01:18:04,729 --> 01:18:09,469
testament to willpower and resiliency
