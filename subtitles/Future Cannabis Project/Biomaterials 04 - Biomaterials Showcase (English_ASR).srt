1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,230
I did want to show some of these

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,910
materials that I have here to everybody

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:21,028
things that I'm excited about

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,698
so this is do you want to send me one

5
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:29,429
the past together patsies around this is

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:33,620
restock the hemp paper yes you can

7
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:37,229
this is Pina Tex so I I was in

8
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:40,859
Copenhagen and went to materials library

9
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:46,099
at this university called Kea and here

10
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:46,100
this has this is like my purse so yeah

11
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:51,480
but but they have they have this

12
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:53,189
materials library and they had a large

13
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,049
sheet of Pina text the largest sheet of

14
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:59,009
Pina text I've ever seen and it it

15
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:01,709
listed was actually in Pina tux which it

16
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:06,959
listed unless this has changed it's

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:09,109
listed as 70% PLA yes which I was really

18
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,849
disappointed about so PLA is plant based

19
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:16,289
plastic that's uh it's called Pina text

20
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:19,109
and so that is a pineapple pineapple

21
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,320
leaf waste pineapple leaf based swatches

22
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:25,680
yeah PLA is poly lactic ass it could be

23
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,868
any type of bio product could you know

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,640
there's different things out there so

25
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:31,349
maybe they're taking the peanut X and

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,868
chemically it's considered poly lactic

27
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:35,158
acid when it's it's not degradable they

28
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:37,290
say on their site that it will not

29
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,939
degrade that it we have our compost yeah

30
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,590
because they have to put additives in it

31
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,109
to make sure that it's you know stay

32
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,868
long I was really bummed about that but

33
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:47,969
that's why I love this material which

34
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:51,149
has nothing added to it at all it's

35
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:55,379
called it's a company called malai and

36
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:57,530
it's a bacterial cellulose alternative

37
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,728
leather which I think we need like a new

38
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:03,718
term for because I feel like it's in

39
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:05,849
between leather and textiles we can't

40
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:08,399
and not flutter and it's not leather

41
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:10,919
because I have a problem with that a big

42
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,729
problem with leather but that that

43
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,949
company

44
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:17,659
they take waste coconut water from some

45
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:20,599
farmers that are raising coconuts for

46
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:22,280
some other reason and feeding it to

47
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,229
bacteria and that bacteria accretes

48
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,000
layers of cellulose and then they layer

49
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:28,939
the cellulose together and add some

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,990
waste banana fiber also to give it some

51
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:31,340
tensile strength and there's different

52
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,740
colors if you can see in those

53
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,610
prototypes so I think that's super

54
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:40,689
exciting I also love my friends company

55
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,459
can bucho biomaterials they're making

56
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:45,770
kombucha rolling papers so just a

57
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:49,659
hundred percent Scobie I can put that

58
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,659
down for the reusables you can do it

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,729
[Laughter]

60
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,819
[Music]

61
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:27,379
yeah we do not it's a it's a product in

62
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:29,569
a service right we do not charge

63
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:31,849
anything for our service so we're

64
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:34,219
collecting all of the waste and

65
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:36,739
providing an opportunity to the

66
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:39,069
cultivators to purchase that back so we

67
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:42,530
do encourage them to purchase that back

68
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:44,870
but we we are we are getting it for free

69
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,939
we're not paying for it and they're not

70
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,620
paying us that might change in the

71
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:50,269
future but that's the way it is

72
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,120
currently which is good because they

73
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:54,950
legally have to have it collected not

74
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,310
just because it's it's cannabis but

75
00:03:54,949 --> 00:04:02,389
because under state regulation a B 1826

76
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:07,250
and also new regulation SB 1380 three so

77
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:09,439
eighty 1826 says that any commercial

78
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,150
account business or multi-family

79
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,650
residential has to have if they create

80
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,649
four cubic yards so with just a normal

81
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:21,108
sized dumpster of material municipal

82
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:22,788
solid waste so any type of trash they

83
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:24,859
have to have organics recycling in place

84
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:26,060
and this is because the state of

85
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,939
California wants to

86
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:32,509
you have a 50% reduction of organics to

87
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:34,100
landfill if they don't reach that goal

88
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:36,500
they're gonna go to if you have two

89
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,360
cubic yards and that's going to go to

90
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,220
every single business so these

91
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,689
businesses because they participate in

92
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,760
because they have an organic feedstock

93
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:48,918
they have to participate in this they

94
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,079
have to have some sort of collection so

95
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:52,549
if he wasn't collecting it for free they

96
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,889
would have to pay for it or they can

97
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:59,210
find some other illegal solution I'm

98
00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:02,870
sure they could compost they can compost

99
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:05,149
on-site if they have that opportunity to

100
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,889
do so yeah but a lot of these large dela

101
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:07,759
growers have too much they have too much

102
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,430
and they would need to be a registered

103
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,529
and licensed fully come sir defied

104
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:16,009
compost facility which in an in itself

105
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:18,349
is very daunting to be a certified in

106
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:23,779
and be to maintain has to maintain under

107
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:25,070
a certain temperature a large conference

108
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:27,289
facility and then they have to get

109
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:29,659
regulated in a different way yeah but

110
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,840
you know to answer your question I mean

111
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,280
we're saving them money on you know like

112
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:37,038
we were talking about percentages of

113
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,079
organic waste 60 70 percent some cases

114
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,349
of the dumpster is going to be organic

115
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,959
green waste so they're the the dumpster

116
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,210
cost for them pipe by week or by month

117
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:52,478
is drastically reduced through using a

118
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:52,478
service like ours yeah

119
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:57,628
because otherwise I know that some any

120
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,430
sort of farmer there either they can

121
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:01,520
burn they can burn their agricultural

122
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:06,389
waste which releases a lot of carbon

123
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:08,698
emissions or they can just let it kind

124
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,168
of rot and not like compost it in a

125
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,528
certified way but that prove that

126
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:16,198
promotes such a it's a slippery slope

127
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:19,168
because then you're promoting the

128
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,389
ecosystem of toxic runoff and air

129
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:23,399
pollutants if it's rotting and molding

130
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:25,379
and no one has a farmer especially a

131
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:37,319
canvas farmer you do not want mold on

132
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:38,939
your facility yeah there is a time frame

133
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,430
associated with that but it's again it's

134
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,979
up to each county to kind of drill down

135
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,209
on that which is kind of a little bit

136
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:47,338
more of the bottleneck of what's

137
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:48,629
happening right now and the relationship

138
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:51,269
I mean that's what we're being told by

139
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:53,610
our cycle but then the county is telling

140
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:55,139
us nowhere it's not on us go talk to Cal

141
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,919
recycle so it's kind of like a game of

142
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,389
hopscotch pass the buck but they're

143
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,968
doing what they can which is great and

144
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:05,430
and they're very proactive so Jessica

145
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:07,079
the the cost for hauling and disposing

146
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,658
of waste I'm assuming that's going up

147
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:12,508
and up and up yeah right like how do you

148
00:07:09,658 --> 00:07:14,579
have a sense of like how much it's gone

149
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,229
over is there a projection of like how

150
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:21,558
much more it's expensive it's supposed

151
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:23,848
to get no well it's all dependent on the

152
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:26,459
contract that your jurisdiction has

153
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:27,058
worked out with the collectors in that

154
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,759
area

155
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:32,189
a lot of cities in the United States

156
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,649
around Los Angeles at around LA Southern

157
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:36,389
California are franchised or non

158
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:38,158
exclusive or exclusive franchise so they

159
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,168
have contracts with the people or they

160
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,908
work the businesses that can come in

161
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:44,788
there and collect this material and they

162
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:46,408
set the rates because of the changing

163
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:48,538
market you know some of these franchise

164
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:50,038
agreements were extremely low and don't

165
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:52,620
really cover the cost of being able to

166
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:55,050
transport and process this material and

167
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,478
because of the fluctuating market and

168
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:01,019
the market sort of you know heading

169
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:06,089
downward at the moment it will even its

170
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:08,850
way out but the it needs to be

171
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:12,419
it has to reflect the actual cost and

172
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:14,250
for the longest time in the 90s when we

173
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,140
started pushing recycling and started

174
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,509
setting recycling legislation and

175
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,099
diversion legislation we said you know

176
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:21,839
this conversation about don't worry

177
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,320
recycling is free you get so much money

178
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,929
for the recycling if you if you recycle

179
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,750
more your waste bill will go down but

180
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,629
recycling is much more expensive than

181
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:36,269
Lam filling a tip fee and the state of

182
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:38,159
California is so incredibly low in

183
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:41,490
comparison to other parts of this

184
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:45,389
country New York City East Coast the tip

185
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:48,930
fees are we tell you sorry the tip fee

186
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:51,240
is when you go take the material tipping

187
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:53,370
a truck when you take the material and

188
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,889
you tip it at the landfill you have to

189
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,139
pay to tip it if you don't own your own

190
00:08:55,889 --> 00:09:01,590
landfills you're really paying a lot of

191
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:03,299
money to tip this and so but the the to

192
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:07,050
tip it out of landfill to get rid of it

193
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:10,319
to dispose of it is so cheap to recycle

194
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:13,139
it is you know adding over a hundred

195
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,440
dollars a ton you know 70 80 depending

196
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,399
on where you are depending on the market

197
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,770
you know you're getting up there and

198
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:24,899
$100 ton composting because in in the in

199
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:27,929
our Southern California area our

200
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:30,809
composting infrastructure is usually far

201
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:32,489
away from our largest cities and so that

202
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:33,569
transportation cost because it is the

203
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,980
heaviest material that you're

204
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,870
transporting it's wine got to be

205
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,340
processed so if it stops to get

206
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,320
processed and has all the bad material

207
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,940
and removed from it I think it spit back

208
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,129
on the truck and then that truck goes to

209
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,060
a facility that's like four more hours

210
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:49,169
away that cost is so expensive and then

211
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,019
you have to compost it and you're

212
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:53,819
hopefully hoping that the people around

213
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,850
you want to use the compost and that

214
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,530
you're not shipping out to two farms two

215
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,759
hours away and you're really losing all

216
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:01,259
your money on this so you're looking at

217
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,189
something like a hundred and eighty

218
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:07,259
dollars a ton or more for just organics

219
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:10,290
because of how the whole system is set

220
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:12,600
up the true cost of this is not taken in

221
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:15,149
consideration but these cities that are

222
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,129
looking at sort of subsidizing these

223
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:19,709
costs in a way where they make the the

224
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:21,480
landfill rate higher

225
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,860
and they make the recycling rate lower

226
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,950
and their gang straight lower they

227
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,840
subsidize it by increasing how much way

228
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,009
you know how much ya incentivizing and

229
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,139
increasing how much the waste is

230
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:34,580
actually gonna cost them so is it gonna

231
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:38,069
go up yeah it's always going to go up

232
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:40,590
transportations expensive you know we're

233
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:44,640
Curtin and we're running out of room we

234
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:47,129
have well you know I gotta say I guess a

235
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,439
two we've got two really massive

236
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:52,889
landfills here in Southern California we

237
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,990
had the like third or fifth at one time

238
00:10:52,889 --> 00:11:01,259
it was the largest but third or fifth

239
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:03,600
largest landfill we have which was it

240
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:05,100
was looking at the world I was looking

241
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,899
at a thing the other day I think it was

242
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,389
like third or fifth and it was Puente

243
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,059
Hills at the time that it was open I

244
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:14,970
know but looking at that list I was like

245
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:17,189
oh where are these other landfills and I

246
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,269
know are pretty big we have some other

247
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,250
big landfills here in Southern

248
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:22,049
California we have one that's the deep

249
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,230
one of the deepest landfills because

250
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:28,169
they've drilled out a mountain and then

251
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:36,210
we have another really I'm just gonna

252
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:39,179
leave it at that just because then we

253
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:41,700
have another landfill that is not really

254
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:45,120
being utilized it's out near the Salton

255
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,290
Sea and it's just really large and one

256
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,299
of the reasons it's not being utilized

257
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,529
as much as I think they thought they

258
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:53,490
were going to be able to use the rail

259
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:54,750
system in order to to transport the

260
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,980
waste but they really didn't tell the

261
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,899
wit rail system that they were gonna be

262
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,769
using the rail system so there's been

263
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:02,669
some issues with that so we have the

264
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:06,449
landfills it would have been a lower

265
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:09,120
carbon trip to the land didn't work out

266
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,680
so yeah so we have the landfills yeah

267
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,659
they are closing around the world yeah

268
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,669
we're going to not hopefully be creating

269
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:16,199
a more landfills but we just we don't

270
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:18,439
need to be relying on them in the first

271
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,440
place

272
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:27,590
