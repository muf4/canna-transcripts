1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,130
I mentioned to you we have a few friends

2
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,189
out here from Denmark couple friends

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,859
down from Canada more and more it seems

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,570
the world is recognizing thankfully the

5
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,220
California really is the epicenter of

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,550
many respects at least with respect to

7
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:29,368
the craft as well as a culture and I

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,589
definitely would say the genetics how do

9
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:33,329
you see that playing out as far as as

10
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,909
far as tourism as far as people come in

11
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,289
here and this essentially being you know

12
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,459
the holy land for lack of a better term

13
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:40,738
when it comes to industry there's

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,530
cannabis oh man I think it has an

15
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,488
unbelievable potential because

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,070
California is already clocking over a

17
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:49,500
billion interest money so it's already a

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,149
global tourist destination and all over

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,909
California it's not just one spot San

20
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,960
Francisco as an ungodly amount of people

21
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:56,189
that want to come and see the beauty of

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,140
San Francisco the culture of San

23
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:00,149
Francisco you have people that are going

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,719
to Southern California to do the

25
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,868
Hollywood experience and that that is

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,430
unbelievably populated with people from

27
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:10,379
every part of the earth coming into it

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,260
so you have these global attractions you

29
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,728
get into Napa area the wine County same

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,689
thing global attraction up where I'm

31
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:18,150
from Humboldt County

32
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:20,429
redwoods global attraction and then all

33
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,320
sudden you put cannabis in there and it

34
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,960
doesn't mean that the people all have to

35
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,789
come here to get high it just means that

36
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,359
they get a window into a world that they

37
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,729
heard about but never could see and it

38
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,319
starts to allow people to tourists to be

39
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:35,578
able to come to regions where you had

40
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,438
people living and like where we are

41
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,419
noble these that specifically some of

42
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,519
the most beautiful region in the world

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,590
I tell people being from the Bay Area

44
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,359
the most beautiful part of California

45
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,159
near Point is north of San Francisco yes

46
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,890
all the way up to Crescent I'm almost

47
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,299
stunning and what you find is you find

48
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,799
all these individuals that form this

49
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,180
really interesting relationship with the

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,100
property so that was highlighted all the

51
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,079
all the grows that were contaminated you

52
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:59,578
know facilities but in every in every

53
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,859
population you're gonna have outliers

54
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,089
that are that are dirty the majority of

55
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,950
people with really pretty good land

56
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,630
stewards and built a really nice

57
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,840
relationship with the land they lived on

58
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:09,939
and in the region

59
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,090
and and what that does it allows people

60
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:16,539
to come up and and see what's it like to

61
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,489
live in the country where you have an

62
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:21,310
industry that was hidden that can now be

63
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,840
seen and what are the people like and

64
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,120
because cannabis people are eclectic and

65
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,979
interesting generator it allows the

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,319
tourists to really have a different type

67
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:31,179
of connection with the people and the

68
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:33,429
people for the first time have to be

69
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,870
open about what they do and they know

70
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,819
that they need to be open so they can

71
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,039
get their products out in the world and

72
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:41,708
they're also no longer afraid to get

73
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,719
arrested so they can actually laugh and

74
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:51,819
feel good about what they've done with

75
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:54,280
the public because really the opposite

76
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:55,659
of a lot of the corporate because the

77
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,969
whole thing with cannabis was that you

78
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:01,239
are basically an independent producer

79
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:03,340
that could function in all aspects on

80
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,530
your own with very little oversight very

81
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,969
little accountability to others and as

82
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,310
long as you made enough money you had

83
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:10,959
time so you live this unbelievable life

84
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,090
that only the mega-wealthy really live

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,069
because they don't have no one else has

86
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,239
time and so if all the cultivators had

87
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:20,949
time which gave them time to develop

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,989
personalities and neglected hobbies and

89
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:25,659
things and it makes it interesting

90
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,159
because it's like going to a circus and

91
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:29,019
there's so many little facets that are

92
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,239
unique to me that's the growing

93
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:33,489
community where everybody is really a

94
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,989
unique character in a play they didn't

95
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,209
have to homogenize because they didn't

96
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,560
have to fit in and when the tourists

97
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,840
meet the people they really enjoy the

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,049
company so I watch it I go when farmers

99
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,359
meet customers it is a really real solid

100
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:47,980
cool thing very true and then you'll

101
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:50,620
have all these facilities that people

102
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:51,759
get to check out product assortment so

103
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,650
we'll be there people will be able to

104
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,649
come in and experience cannabis and in

105
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,090
in bath bombs so you you take your wife

106
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,799
and go hike in and she's like I'd love

107
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,930
to take a can of his bath bomb you know

108
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,760
so she feels wonderful she goes wow

109
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,159
that's that's that's how I consume

110
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,949
cannabis through the skin your

111
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,780
grandmother uses it on her feet your

112
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,439
your your brother only likes to take a

113
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,829
candy

114
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,870
you're smoking flour you're able to use

115
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:19,389
cannabis in all these ways that are

116
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,009
readily available accessible tourists

117
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,350
enroll oh the world want to experience

118
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:25,029
it and if you make it Pleasant and you

119
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,760
give them all the different choices and

120
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:29,259
you allow them to make the choices then

121
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,310
they get to experience cannabis and some

122
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,529
of the most beautiful regions in the

123
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,540
world and it allows them to be able to

124
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:36,099
relax and and what I see with most

125
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,840
literacies that they're they're

126
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,310
overworked in their technical stuff you

127
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,310
mean like most people are doing data

128
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:45,129
entry tech very computer driven work and

129
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,569
they they they're they're frozen in a

130
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:48,189
thing and you get them out in the

131
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:50,918
country and you get them into cannabis

132
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:52,478
growing regions and you got yourself an

133
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,639
incredible experience different than

134
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,560
wine because wine even though the

135
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,009
facilities a gorgeous and wine is an

136
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,050
incredible substance you have a

137
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:04,839
different impact from wine in terms of

138
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,189
it's a depressant it is natural it's

139
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,719
drug as a drug and so I mean I don't

140
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:09,550
knock the wine or the industry never

141
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,760
mind that the grapes do to the to the

142
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,680
soil but that's a whole other chemicals

143
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,899
can be used but yep ultimately the grape

144
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,750
industry does some unbelievable work on

145
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:21,699
visual beauty experiment and satisfying

146
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:25,538
the individuals experience visiting that

147
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:27,009
place and that's really where we model

148
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:29,709
cannabis and in a sense is that we

149
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:32,199
realize that people want good escapism

150
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:34,209
and cannabis provides it and it doesn't

151
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,060
have to be necessarily in a psychoactive

152
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,918
way and the people that that produced it

153
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,810
provide escapism to them because they're

154
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:42,459
very unique individuals it would be like

155
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,038
going back into Appalachia and talking

156
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:46,478
to the moonshine runners and saying hey

157
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,120
let me hop in your car and go drift

158
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,370
around because we know moonshine turned

159
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,319
into NASCAR oh yeah hundred percent so

160
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,848
but I think this you're right it is I

161
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,098
think of some of the growers I'm a huge

162
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:58,689
fan of you guys but even the family over

163
00:05:57,098 --> 00:06:00,459
hidden prairie Oreo or whatever I mean

164
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:03,038
there's to your point everyone is so

165
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:05,319
unique it is eclectic you've done some

166
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,120
world travels you can attest just like

167
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,399
I've been Australia I've been to South

168
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,769
America I've been across Europe the

169
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,348
culture it's uniform it's so interesting

170
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:16,569
because the the religious beliefs might

171
00:06:14,348 --> 00:06:18,728
shift or the language might shift or

172
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:21,279
certain elements of the ideology but

173
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:23,620
overall it's it is good vibes it's crazy

174
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,809
because that's kind of like it almost an

175
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,340
unofficial mantra of our industry right

176
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,439
is as long as it's good vibes but

177
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:30,310
speaking specifically about use I don't

178
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,170
know if people

179
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,329
I mean you really remind me Kevin and

180
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,939
this is going back to being a California

181
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:38,229
guy almost like the Huell Howser of this

182
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:40,329
industry and this guy cool house

183
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,189
originally from Tennessee he'd come out

184
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:44,189
into a series called California Gold

185
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:46,300
nobody embraced I mean this guy really

186
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:48,100
he doe California better than most

187
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,420
native Californians that's what I love

188
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,490
about you again coming from the East

189
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,770
Coast come an interesting story that's a

190
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,060
whole other whole other show but your

191
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:58,599
background coming here

192
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,100
you have so embraced not just California

193
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,300
not just this industry but the whole

194
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,430
aspect some of the things you're doing

195
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,170
with Humboldt specifically on cheer

196
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,180
point the Chamber of Commerce and and

197
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,850
the stuff to get the tourism and breeze

198
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,410
some much-needed life into that into

199
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:14,110
that area right you tie it all together

200
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,430
because we feel private prior cannabis

201
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,960
stigmatized a lot of illegitimate

202
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,910
industries even though they've benefited

203
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,719
from it but publicly it causing problems

204
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:24,340
and now with that stigma removed you're

205
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,830
able to really start to be honest with

206
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:28,089
you each other as business owners and

207
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:29,829
you can all start to figure out how do

208
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:32,019
you benefit each other in a way that

209
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:35,109
benefits the region so that you have a

210
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:36,909
longevity because we all live there so

211
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,800
it's not it's not colonialism it's not

212
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,350
extraction it's not resources leave

213
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,680
money leaves it's hopefully resources of

214
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,090
rebuilt improved and capital remains so

215
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,689
that you end up having better better

216
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:51,069
quality community and I'm just dumb

217
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:52,930
about it man the new billboards that are

218
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:54,699
going up the Laura from the southern

219
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,310
Humble Visitors Bureau they put together

220
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,229
this incredible campaign with some of

221
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,740
the other business owners elevate the

222
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,790
magic and they have some phenomenal

223
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,129
billboards that are going up that are

224
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,980
that are going to talk about America's

225
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:10,629
cannabis heartlands and you had you have

226
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,270
publications like the North Coast

227
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:14,709
Journal that putting out the dispensary

228
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:17,829
guides and they're there helping with

229
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:20,019
the the picture of the visual that

230
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:22,509
helping shape the tone but in a way that

231
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:23,680
really reflects the region not because

232
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:25,689
they're trying to be your distributor

233
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,910
they're trying to highlight it so it's

234
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:29,949
this beautiful internal development

235
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,320
versus an external force to drive a

236
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:35,830
result it's about really getting the

237
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,940
people to be able to see what's to

238
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,250
happen in and

239
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,690
and help them with the things they need

240
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,139
which are things that the opposite of

241
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,550
what they've done

242
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:46,419
everybody's really good at hiding oh

243
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:48,490
yeah it's sort of shadows that's easy

244
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:52,479
but it's hard just like it's hard to be

245
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,950
well-known and to have the community say

246
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,710
okay we'll all agree that we don't need

247
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:59,950
to be shamed we can advertise it we can

248
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,330
have quality advertising and then we can

249
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,370
have cannabis people that are coming to

250
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,230
see cannabis how do we steer them into

251
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,029
the hotels how do we scare them into

252
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,110
vacation packages that are gonna be fun

253
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,799
for them that are going to reflect

254
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,860
Humboldt County's lifestyle which is

255
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:16,929
unbelievably diverse from heavy Coast

256
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,120
pounding surf beautiful rivers stunning

257
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:20,319
planes gorgeous mountains it's

258
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:27,100
everything you want is there everything

259
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:30,670
is so nobody on the beach

260
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,560
many people petrolia no people yeah and

261
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:34,120
so it's a privilege to walk on the beach

262
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,229
with nobody on the damn Beach except you

263
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,389
and your friends you like what is unreal

264
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,950
well ñ even when you guys do a partying

265
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:40,449
and again this is in your backyard but

266
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,490
but talking about northern nights or

267
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,980
reggae on the river right you're tapping

268
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,870
into the Gen Y there's that generation

269
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,879
but I love how even when they come up

270
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,830
you guys like hey we're on the river no

271
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,120
class we're all about eco we have the

272
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,370
water station it's like everything that

273
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,529
goes on in Humboldt is still respecting

274
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,179
what Humboldt was always about all the

275
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,490
way back to which we've discussed before

276
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:02,799
it was it wasn't the hippie movement as

277
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,419
much as it was the forestry right I mean

278
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,859
you've talked about that yes I mean I

279
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:08,139
love the history lesson that you give

280
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,669
when people come up there and say you

281
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:10,779
guys got it all wrong like this is what

282
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:13,269
really happened this was the evolution

283
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:16,089
of of how cannabis came to be in this

284
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:17,439
this area of the country and people are

285
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,940
passionate about it and I think the kids

286
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,700
are today are too though like the

287
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,770
problem is that you know what happens is

288
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,390
you get educated how to behave by the

289
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:27,939
world around you correct and when it's

290
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:29,710
in a disposable world and very transient

291
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,660
fast-paced no need to make connections

292
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,519
that's what you learn but when you come

293
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:35,469
up to a smaller town you go out on the

294
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,679
coast you go into the into a smaller

295
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:40,420
neighborhood all of a sudden people are

296
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,759
more watchful of each other because you

297
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:44,588
learn to rely on each other and it

298
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:46,689
starts to humanize people and that's why

299
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,990
you know small-town Americana is in your

300
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,029
small town anywhere in the world

301
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:53,149
is always so rich because you get to see

302
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:56,240
people at their at their finest because

303
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:58,458
their desire to be good as that it's her

304
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,649
desire to be good there's no ulterior

305
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:02,119
motive they want to be able to do that

306
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:05,450
and so when you can get people into the

307
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,759
country and you can you can let them

308
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:10,399
enjoy being in a clean environment and

309
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,159
they realize that that that's part of it

310
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,860
that we don't throw trash on the ground

311
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:19,009
they don't know and people start to

312
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,899
really you know slow down and they put

313
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:22,309
the phone down they might actually talk

314
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:24,409
to you in person instead of text you

315
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:25,699
while they're standing next to you and

316
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:28,309
that's important because it starts to

317
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,959
get you back on a more grounded level so

318
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:31,609
that you can then return to your busy

319
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,719
hectic life living in the city that

320
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,339
looks like someone's dumped the trash

321
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,278
can over the top of the fire hydrant

322
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:39,649
yeah and and you deal with it and then

323
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:42,230
you know you can go to the country go to

324
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,360
the ocean and and find some kind of

325
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,100
balance but when you go there you don't

326
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,610
bring the bad habits of the city bring

327
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:52,339
the good habits which is understanding

328
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,169
that things move but also understanding

329
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:56,120
that you don't have to move in tune with

330
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:57,588
it the same way yeah we talked about

331
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,209
just now touched on but maybe getting a

332
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:00,950
little bit more into one log I mean this

333
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:03,078
is something where people that aren't

334
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,778
from California aren't familiar or those

335
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:07,549
that haven't been here for decades it's

336
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:08,750
kind of special when you come up 101 a

337
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:11,750
lot of people don't notice you ask

338
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:14,000
someone that's from San Diego LA San

339
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,549
Francisco Sacramento if you ever knew

340
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,828
there to be a stop sign or a single lane

341
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:20,419
on 101 and they go what are you crazy

342
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:22,338
this this is the biggest freeway it runs

343
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:24,708
through our state this can't you go to a

344
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:26,480
little town called Garberville and you

345
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:29,149
will find that stop sign you will find

346
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,190
that cross walk across 101 and that's

347
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:33,350
what amazed me again growing up in Marin

348
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,329
County being a kid from the bay that

349
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,040
people don't know just how sacred and

350
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:38,958
special it is when you're coming up into

351
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,120
the proper triangle and you guys are

352
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,889
right there you've got one log I mean

353
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,528
that that's the first thing I see when I

354
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:48,289
come into town never mind the huge tree

355
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:49,370
that it was named after right so tell me

356
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:50,958
a little bit about what you guys are

357
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,370
doing there if what you have in the

358
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,319
works I know you have some plans as far

359
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,139
as expanding on the space you have in

360
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,340
2019 as well you know that we're really

361
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:02,139
fortunate though the

362
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:05,360
one log site right on the 101 is

363
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:08,569
historic tourist destination with coffee

364
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,759
shop tourist things

365
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:13,400
what redwood carvings a lot of cool

366
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,889
old-school big redwood carvings and it

367
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,179
used to have a lot of salmon that was

368
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:18,710
sold out of there back in the day when

369
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:20,269
the salmon was really hot and in the

370
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,040
river before we had the droughts and

371
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:23,899
some of the offshore issues so the

372
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:25,429
salmon business was hot at the spot and

373
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:28,269
people from all over it would be driving

374
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:31,909
down one on one they'd pull in there's a

375
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:34,429
beautiful Grove stunning redwoods and

376
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:36,620
the one log itself was is a giant one

377
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:37,849
log redwood tree that they used to drive

378
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,039
around the country on the back of a

379
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,230
truck in the 50s and it took six months

380
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:44,059
to carve out with chisels and they built

381
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,860
a house inside it and you can actually

382
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:50,088
walk around inside the log like it's a

383
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,950
house that's a crazy story you know my

384
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:53,810
partners grab this facility and we put a

385
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,420
dispensary in it the nursery there's a

386
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:57,769
new extraction of a giant extraction

387
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:00,349
facility but that all these things are

388
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:01,659
tucked away you can't see them so you

389
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,129
can see the store when you roll up

390
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:06,620
because of the signage but everything

391
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:09,679
else is completely woven into this these

392
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,360
groves so that it you never really think

393
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,309
you're in an industrial area at all

394
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,629
no you walk in I walked in and I was

395
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:15,889
like well you have no idea yeah the

396
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:20,120
whole building is a nursery the holes

397
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:22,929
the whole basement is a nursery all

398
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,429
blown out yeah then you're on five acres

399
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:30,469
creates a mile of riverfront and you got

400
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:32,049
the Northern Lights is my partner's so

401
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,360
they're then the northern Knights crew

402
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:36,829
two great guys and then High Times is

403
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,960
next door which is the old reggae site

404
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:40,759
yep so we catch some of that stuff and

405
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,389
what we're doing right now is we're

406
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:46,490
putting in the development of some form

407
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:48,230
of visitor center so that what we have

408
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,850
an ability to do is start to really get

409
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,039
the tourists to come into the facility

410
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:55,278
and then help them understand where to

411
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:56,088
go because you need what do you do when

412
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:57,528
you're out in the middle of nowhere

413
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:58,940
there's no directories and there's

414
00:14:57,528 --> 00:15:01,129
pamphlets and stuff but what you need is

415
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:04,400
more comprehensive and Heritage's and

416
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:06,320
and River guides and hikes

417
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,370
and the eco-tourism component of

418
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,990
humboldt just has to be really

419
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,560
highlighted because it's kind of hard to

420
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:15,289
know what to do without having some form

421
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,778
of help yeah and then we will be able to

422
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,338
put in all the farmers gear so we'll be

423
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:21,889
able to sell farmers clothes and all

424
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:23,180
their branding labels and let the flip

425
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:26,299
the people come in and pick this stuff

426
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:28,129
up and we can have music events in the

427
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:29,629
back we can have farmer events I'll be

428
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:31,850
able to put the golden tarp event back

429
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:33,889
out on it which is that Cup and I didn't

430
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,019
do it this year because we didn't have

431
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:42,490
an ability legally to do it without it

432
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:44,778
being in a State Fairgrounds the gut and

433
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,940
we'll do it again in the back of the

434
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,710
facility next year so we have this

435
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,830
ability to hold all these really killer

436
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,540
events and it allows people to come off

437
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,810
the highway and pull in the parking lot

438
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:59,439
then we have 88 bathrooms which is

439
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:02,569
crucial because it allows you to catch a

440
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,310
population of everybody yes and there's

441
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,860
a food there's a small restaurant

442
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:09,379
there's a really a gift shop and that's

443
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,089
all Humboldt County centric so unless

444
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:12,230
people come in and feel like they're in

445
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:15,110
Humboldt and then when we built the

446
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:19,190
dispensary or the partners Jonah was a

447
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:21,950
master bricklayer glued like 14,000

448
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,050
glutton shot 14,000 hand-cut redwood

449
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,360
blocks to the wall to make it look like

450
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:28,609
you're inside all we'll have to hope

451
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,019
it's visually the guys can dub in I'm

452
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,570
coming up on Monday I'll send him a

453
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:34,370
picture but that you you can't

454
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:38,089
understand this until you actually go

455
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:42,169
there so you know you're in the redwoods

456
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:43,910
but it has modern amenities so what it

457
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:46,399
does is it lets people that want to

458
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:48,740
escape their digital life and be green

459
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,958
could be green but they can still use

460
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,639
the phone and they can still have normal

461
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,099
things that they need to function in the

462
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,649
way they've built their worlds but they

463
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,350
can get out of that world and go enjoy

464
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:02,208
the river and enjoy the the grandfather

465
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,980
tree next door to us is me max is

466
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,088
nominal we're Richardson grow of which

467
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,900
is you know some of them some of the

468
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:10,789
most central region in the area and it's

469
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,329
it's just it's really nice to be able to

470
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:13,158
be so

471
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:17,448
yeah you know I mean I didn't mind being

472
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:20,600
private I'll be honest well yeah on the

473
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:22,220
hill you've been prime for a while but I

474
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,629
love the new rena side call it a

475
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,798
renaissance all the time because it's an

476
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,870
it's an awakening which is what a

477
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,579
renaissance sure for sure and for the

478
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:34,219
first time you know the mainstream can

479
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:37,220
touch cultivators businesses can benefit

480
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,079
from the the new tourists that'll come

481
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,278
in and they will it so there's a

482
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:41,359
transition how much going through some

483
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:43,730
are times yeah

484
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:46,339
but the the fact that you were able to

485
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,710
start having a California that's that's

486
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:51,980
so big that there's not that many places

487
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,720
left that aren't that crowded and

488
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,720
homeless one of them and it's just a

489
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,389
trip up the 101 Greg foster did an

490
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,429
incredible job bringing in airline so we

491
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:10,699
have direct flights to LA direct flights

492
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:12,500
to Denver yeah and they have one in San

493
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,538
Francisco you have the Frisco one

494
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,148
everyday but now there's a Frisco LA in

495
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:20,240
Denver everyday so you can go from

496
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:21,949
Humboldt so the two Colorado the East

497
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,480
Coast in a single hop you don't got to

498
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,819
go to another hub airport and jump out

499
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,889
you can go to LA and so it's

500
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:29,928
hour-and-a-half to LA 3540 minutes of

501
00:18:27,888 --> 00:18:33,168
Frisco and all of a sudden man people

502
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:36,470
are coming in to visit or hangout and I

503
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:38,090
just I hope I live long enough to be

504
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:41,329
able to see where how this will change

505
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:42,980
because it'll be like Napa and the wine

506
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,990
region where at one time it was like

507
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,599
this and then it became oh yeah so

508
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,370
develop Napa was I got my mom moved up

509
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,808
there you know parents divorce I was

510
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:53,178
young or long story short my mom moved

511
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:54,168
up there off Silverado try remember when

512
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,850
Napa wasn't cool

513
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:58,009
you're one same thing people don't know

514
00:18:55,849 --> 00:19:00,379
downtown Napa was it was pretty ratchet

515
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:01,940
as the kids saying yes it was kind of

516
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,740
tired then all of a sudden to your point

517
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,990
Napa it's about bill and I mean there's

518
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,519
that Sonoma County to him but it's come

519
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,388
a long way and I agree I'd love to see

520
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,429
that in Humboldt

521
00:19:08,388 --> 00:19:13,129
I love to see it in Garber build up I

522
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:16,278
mean all the way up the corridor do you

523
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,269
recall all the way yeah and the bottom

524
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:18,869
line is you have these beautiful

525
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:20,589
northern regions

526
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:22,629
underpopulated and they'll never be

527
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:26,319
overpopulated because they're not built

528
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:28,180
for the flat ground sprawl for the big

529
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,429
city but they're definitely designed for

530
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:33,150
people to escape the sprawl and to go

531
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:35,950
enjoy themselves and meet nice people

532
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,690
smoke some really good grass and see

533
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:40,029
some visual beauty that's just you know

534
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:44,620
you can't just can't film it I know no I

535
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:45,910
can't wait to come back well I stopped

536
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:47,259
by supposed to be a half an hour we

537
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,000

538
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:50,980
