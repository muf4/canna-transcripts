00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,000
waen county sheriff's office thank you

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,800
all for joining us this morning the

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,640
league as you know was very active in

12
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,359
helping craft and Shepherd the uh

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,198
medical cannabis regulation and safety

14
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:48,159
act and uh we have a set of priorities

15
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:50,960
with regard to the passage of

16
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,959
proposition 64 and the reconciliation

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,239
first we think it is essential to

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,439
establish a means of verifying local

19
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:59,640
compliance prior to the issuance of a

20
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,079
state license the medical Act was very

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,799
clear on this local approval was

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,920
absolutely required prior to applying

23
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:09,000
for a state license prop 64 on the other

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,240
hand expressly states that applicants

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,319
are not required to submit evidence of

26
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,319
local approval with the state

27
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,199
application there is however another

28
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,959
provision saying that state license

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,759
cannot be issued if it's in violation of

30
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:23,798
local ordinances so even uh with that

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,438
provision the way it's written uh state

32
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:27,759
agencies are going to be in the

33
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,000
unfortunate position of having to chase

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,000
after individual local jurisdictions to

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,040
get their licenses and then

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,759
unfortunately interpret them unless

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,759
there's a change in the law so we have

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,799
um helped develop language that we think

39
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,799
would uh meaningfully restore a means of

40
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,640
verifying local compliance to avoid

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,759
problems with licenses being issued uh

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,000
when they're not uh in in concert with

43
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,718
what the local regulatory structure

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,799
is second we would uh ask the

45
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,000
legislature to bear in mind the likely

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,719
Federal reaction and crafting various

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,280
parts of the regulatory structure

48
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:10,799
reconciling prop 64 with the medical act

49
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,080
we do know from uh the coal memo and

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
other uh sources from the Department of

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,400
Justice that two of the federal litmus

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,160
tests are diversion and

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,800
inversion inversion uh helping to

54
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,719
facilitate the mixing of illegal

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,519
unregulated product with legal regulated

56
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:29,000
product and uh export outside California

57
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,039
now the small growers association has

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,318
stated public that currently California

59
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,280
consumes only 30% of what it produces so

60
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,119
the other 70% is already going out of

61
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,318
state so there is an issue with respect

62
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,480
to likely Federal intervention just on

63
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:44,799
the amount of product that's being

64
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,479
generated in that regard we would urge

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,640
caution in approving type five licenses

66
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:53,079
which allow for unlimited cultivation in

67
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:55,679
5 years without some further uh

68
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,000
restrictions for example a certification

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,159
by the department of food and egg that

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,759
there is some supply side problem with

71
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:03,679
the current amount of cultivation

72
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,840
underway in California Colorado is being

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,599
sued on this basis Alone by neighboring

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,319
states right

75
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,199
now something to bear in mind we would

76
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:16,039
respectfully urge caution in deciding

77
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,199
upon how products will be distributed in

78
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,079
California distribution whether it is

79
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:22,479
vertical

80
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,120
integration uh or uh mandatory

81
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,039
thirdparty distribution should have

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,400
sufficient regulatory components and

83
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,519
controls in place to ensure compliance

84
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,360
both with state law

85
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,480
as well as to facilitate Federal

86
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,319
enforcement for any

87
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,039
violations one of the things that we

88
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,359
think would be helpful would be uniform

89
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,919
uh required electronic

90
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,920
manifests finally cities have no

91
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,119
interest in crafting local regulations

92
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,119
particularly in regard to uh cities that

93
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,680
have embraced this change in law and are

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,158
looking at it as a potential source of

95
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,640
Revenue to replace State subsidies such

96
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:58,598
as the loss of Redevelopment and

97
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,598
Enterprise zones they have no interest

98
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:02,318
in crafting local regulation

99
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,639
engaging in Planning and Zoning

100
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,759
activities to allow these facilities

101
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,518
affirmatively permitting them and

102
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,798
finally developing a local tax structure

103
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,239
only to have the federal government

104
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,680
sweep in and shut it all down so we

105
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,120
would urge caution in how this is all uh

106
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,840
arranged in the future in regard to any

107
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,918
reconciliation finally a note on the uh

108
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,359
the tax rate the tax rate is there's a

109
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,758
state excise tax of 15% the league

110
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,560
opposed similar legislation last year

111
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,879
Senate Bill 987 simply because we

112
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,160
thought it was too high 10% would be a

113
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,600
little more reasonable and we oppose

114
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,120
that for two reasons one we are

115
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,199
concerned about the stimulation of Black

116
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,959
Market activity and second we uh were

117
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,478
bearing in mind the cumulative tax rate

118
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,839
and the fact that local governments may

119
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:48,199
want to add on their own local taxes and

120
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,719
15% certainly seem to crowd that out the

121
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:54,038
possibility for those additional um

122
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,240
local tax measures now in educating our

123
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:59,159
members about this change in law we have

124
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,600
urged that they look at local existing

125
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,160
local tax measures to see if there are

126
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,520
any um Revenue structures excuse me

127
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,720
revenue streams that uh can be

128
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:11,000
established that are marijuana related

129
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,199
before they rush to enact some new form

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,759
of local tax having said that the 15%

131
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,840
tax rate uh in in the long term is

132
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,360
probably going to need to be lowered

133
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:25,159
that concludes my remarks thank

134
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,479
you thank you good please thank you good

135
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,479
morning Cara Martinson with the

136
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,758
California State Association of counties

137
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,439
thank you so much for um um having us

138
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,600
come speak to you today and provide some

139
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,199
feedback and I really do appreciate the

140
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,840
conversation and some of the comments

141
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,038
that were made by previous panels

142
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,318
because I think they highlight some of

143
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,560
the issues that the league and seesac

144
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:47,080
are continuing uh to focus on um we were

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,240
very involved in the development of the

146
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:51,879
mcrsa and were able to provide some

147
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,600
early and initial input into prop 64 and

148
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,879
that local control piece was extremely

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,199
important to local governments and while

150
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:03,360
we recognize uh that it's difficult to

151
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:06,120
manage 58 counties and 480 some cities

152
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,080
um different regulatory programs we

153
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,079
thought that that was necessary uh for

154
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,439
uh jurisdictions to be able to reflect

155
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:16,959
the will of their community so there is

156
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:19,800
a lot happening at the local level uh

157
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,359
and uh I think we can tell by where prop

158
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,120
64 passed about two-thirds of California

159
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,319
counties voted in favor of proposition

160
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,478
64 and we do think that will be somewhat

161
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:32,240
reflective of how cannabis is regulated

162
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,318
at the local level with that local

163
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,000
control piece uh in there uh as I

164
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,199
mentioned there's a lot of activity

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,918
happening right now uh within the city

166
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,160
and county level just as a snapshot uh I

167
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:47,839
believe there were 53 local City and

168
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,120
County ballot measures on the November

169
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,159
2016 ballot related to cannabis 39 of

170
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,319
those successful and out of those there

171
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,400
were seven County tax measures so in

172
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,240
addition to uh what the um prop 64

173
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,839
already sets into statute

174
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,199
so Folks at the local level are thinking

175
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,038
about this uh they're working with the

176
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,598
uh regulatory agencies that were up here

177
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,159
and I would like to thank them for their

178
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:13,439
Outreach um to us and being available to

179
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,120
answer our questions uh because that

180
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,399
coordination is going to be extremely

181
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,199
important uh in order for the state to

182
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,799
meet its statutory obligation of issuing

183
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,000
licenses January 1 2018 local

184
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,400
governments are going to have to have

185
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
their programs in place as well uh so we

186
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,638
have a vested interest in uh seeing the

187
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,639
state be successful and have them

188
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,918
achieve their goals so that we are able

189
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:39,120
to do that as well at the local level uh

190
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:43,198
but we do have a concern related to

191
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,319
timing because of of the urgency uh and

192
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,120
uh drafts still out there and that we

193
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:48,800
haven't seen yet and we would uh

194
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,399
encourage the agencies to continue to

195
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,560
outreach to us because there are a

196
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,839
number of counties out there that are

197
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,560
ahead of the curve that have been uh

198
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,119
working on medical marijuana have

199
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,240
developed their own track and Trace

200
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,120
programs that have um develop their own

201
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,478
licensing schemes uh so we feel that we

202
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,000
uh have a lot of expertise in this area

203
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:10,758
in some jurisdictions and can offer uh

204
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,279
comments and input into that regulatory

205
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,840
process um in addition as some of um the

206
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,079
other fellow panelists have made

207
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:20,918
comments uh and I won't reiterate but

208
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,359
there are are many differences between

209
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:27,799
the mcrsa and prop 64 in addition to the

210
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,120
local licensing piece um we've heard a

211
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,038
lot about the role of the ad

212
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,399
commissioner

213
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,559
and the role of environmental health

214
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,799
directors and we're very interested to

215
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,239
see what those draft regulations look

216
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,958
like and if they contemplate a role for

217
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,959
our department heads in any type of um

218
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,439
state regulatory scheme uh that will be

219
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,679
very important to coordinate with us

220
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,760
obviously uh we're also very concerned

221
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,439
about enforcement at the local level and

222
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,278
who takes care of that and what that

223
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,839
piece looks like and I'm sure um some of

224
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,360
my colleagues on the law enforcement

225
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,640
side will touch on that and then finally

226
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,360
I do think the revenue collect ction uh

227
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,679
and the banking component of this

228
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,360
conversation is extremely important and

229
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:09,759
probably one of our most challenging

230
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:13,440
issues uh if I do say so myself um

231
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,639
seesac and my boss Matt K sits on the

232
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,200
treasurers banking working group and we

233
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,879
are committed to working with all those

234
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,160
entities involved to develop an interim

235
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:23,679
solution uh I think it's fair to say

236
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,319
that there is an extreme amount of

237
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,439
uncertainty at the federal level uh and

238
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,600
as we wait uh for clarity and guidance

239
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,720
we will and we are also working on

240
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,839
implementing our program and so we need

241
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,720
to be thinking about um how we deal with

242
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,600
that cash situation it's my

243
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,800
understanding that there are only two

244
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,000
Boe districts that accept cash and

245
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,958
likewise at the county level with the

246
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,360
treasurers uh Tax Collectors at the

247
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,799
counter they're not equipped to deal

248
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,399
with the amount of cash uh that we'll be

249
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,319
collecting if there is also a local tax

250
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,078
measure in place so uh we're working

251
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,000
with Folks at the level talking to Folks

252
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:01,919
at the state level and trying to develop

253
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,600
some Creative Solutions uh to that

254
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,078
challenging and nuanced uh problem but

255

oversight hearing uh thank you for

enforcement on this panel my name is Ron

269

Lawrence I'm the police chief of the

270

city of Citrus Heights I'm also the

here talking on behalf of today as a

274
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,879
Statewide Association the California

275
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,760
police Chiefs find ourselves in the

276
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,679
interesting situation of supporting the

277
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,559
medical marijuana legislation signed by

278
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:53,719
Governor Brown in 2015 and we strongly

279
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:56,599
opposed proposition 64 for a wide

280
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,440
variety of reasons we now join many of

281
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,040
the stakeholders here today in working

282
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,839
together to B balance the often

283
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:06,159
conflicting interests behind the mcrsa

284
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:09,320
and the a AUM to develop one regulatory

285
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:11,039
structure for cannabis in doing so

286
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,839
California police Chiefs will continue

287
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,278
to advocate for absolute local control

288
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,120
dual state and local licensing limits on

289
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:21,439
vertical integration and cross Li chist

290
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,480
licensing and thorough background checks

291
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,760
for

292
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,159
lenses however in ushering in the

293
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,519
commercial structure of marijuana

294
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:30,600
through ballot initiative brings a new

295
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,320
set of problems as police Chiefs have

296
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,000
challenges and issues facing us and we

297
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,040
look forward to working with you and all

298
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,879
the stakeholders at getting them

299
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:40,120
addressed uh I'm going to stick with

300
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:41,360
five fundamental overarching concerns

301
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,959
that the police Chiefs have and I'm

302
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,519
going to keep them in very brief summary

303
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:49,000
first and foremost is for us to protect

304
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,480
local control each of our communities is

305
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,120
is vastly and wildly uh unique and

306
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,720
different with different sets of

307
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,200
expectations and our po policy makers at

308
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,240
the local level the city councils and

309
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,639
our Board of Supervisors must have the

310
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,799
the latitude and the agility to craft

311
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,440
policy and ordinances that best suit the

312
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:07,879
needs and expectation of their of our

313
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,360
local communities secondly the

314
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,879
commercial system is one based on

315
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,759
increased use and sales it is critical

316
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,639
that stakeholders work together to deter

317
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,519
identify and success successfully

318
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:21,198
prosecute marijuana impaired driving the

319
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,879
CHP spoke very eloquently about that so

320
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:24,439
I won't uh speak too much more on that

321
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,278
but it is important issue to California

322
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,839
police Chiefs number three advertising

323
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,480
and branding are sure to come with the

324
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,639
newly established for-profit industry we

325
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,240
urge all of us to prevent our history

326
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,240
with the tobacco industry and its impact

327
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,159
on our youth from repeating itself to

328
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,440
ensure that Joe cannabis or marijuana

329
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,360
man don't crop up and become common

330
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,519
fixtures in our society we are very

331
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,680
supportive of the regulations

332
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,799
surrounding proper packaging of Edibles

333
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,919
and the non-advertising to our

334
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:56,319
youth number four state and local law

335
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:58,198
enforcement entities in our Criminal

336
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,639
Justice System need to work across

337
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:01,799
jurisdictional boundaries

338
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,240
to ensure that our legal justice system

339
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,399
is not exploited to embolden the black

340
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,198
market number five and lastly we cannot

341
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,879
ignore the inflexible nature of a ballot

342
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:13,078
initiative as new challenges and needs

343
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,720
present themselves we will be

344
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:16,319
hardpressed to identify solutions that

345
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,240
do not conflict with the language in

346
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,680
proposition 64 this will require all of

347
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,519
us to have creative thinking uh all of

348
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,479
us leaders and stakeholders who cannot

349
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,039
be deterred from solving real problems

350
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,399
as a result of the initiative stringent

351
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,799
Amendment language Mr chair chairman on

352
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,198

00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,799
this forward thank you and thank you for

356
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:41,039

357
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,240
Captain if you will please good morning

speak as Chief Lawrence just elely put

364
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,159
that we agree with what the Cal State

365
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:00,359
chair Chiefs of Police Association agree

366
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,799
with and sentiments on on their concerns

367
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,278
on there I'm kind of here as a more of a

368
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,679
boots on the ground I work a task force

369
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,198
that deals with narcotics and stuff and

370
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,758
so our our the goals are looking we're

371
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:13,198
developing policy and procedures now to

372
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,959
follow the new laws as written to

373
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,679
provide best service to community while

374
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,319
upholding the law of the state and the

375
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,559
public safety is number

376
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,639
one I was fortunate enough to go to

377
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,039
Colorado during July to meet with the

378
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,839
Colorado Chiefs of police and other

379
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:30,519
leagues leagues of supporting and

380
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,279
supportive that to understand what the

381
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,519
impact had occurred in there from what

382
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,399
we've learned from that and we believed

383
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,720
we anticipate increase in the marijuana

384
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,320
activity in several areas including that

385
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,240
L the black market it's still rampant

386
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,240
there um drug driving is a concern

387
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,879
obviously vehicle accidents the rise

388
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,519
that occurred from this marijuana use in

389
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:56,639
in and near schools and parks increas in

390
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,240
emergency room business due to toxicity

391
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,480
overdoses and psychotic episodes that

392
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,959
will come for

393
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,519
this you know it's we're kind of at

394
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,799
right now we've unknown as to where the

395
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,240
licensing regulation agencies are going

396
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,958
to be as we learned in col as they

397
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,879
learned in Colorado one key component

398
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,039
they did is law enforcement was tied

399
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,639
directly with the regulatory agency so

400
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:22,719
they created a task force as you would

401
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,879
to work with them because they are you

402
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,800
can be dealing with a

403
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,958
dangerous commodity in here so it's a

404
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,719
concern so we look forward to developing

405
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:36,159
relationship with regulatory board and

406
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,879
states and with local things um the

407
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,439
another concern will be they they talked

408
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,958
about us the pesticides found in there

409
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,000
currently going to as we do is we

410
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,838
eradicate marijuana cultivation sites

411
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,600
right now as we go to these sites we are

412
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,720
finding common house household

413
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,639
pesticides in there you can purchase at

414
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,440
Home Depot so that's obviously going to

415
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,799
be a concern for the Regulatory Agencies

416
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,319
and who while they'll deal with that

417
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:04,198
um as you know it's you cigarette

418
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:06,120
smoking is banned in C in different

419
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:09,479
areas just like the smoking of marijuana

420
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:14,120
is banned in areas well that is a hard

421
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,600
road to to enforce as you see because

422
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,879
with the new vaporizing cigarettes

423
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,839
you're really not sure what people are

424
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,480
smoking and so it's going to be an

425
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,279
interesting challenge as law enforcement

426
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,079
to work on

427
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:29,120
that just in general and just to give

428
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:32,879
you a rough ideaas my county is in The

429
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,639
Last 5 Years in the last 5 years we have

430
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,679
eradicated illegal cultivation grows

431
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:42,519
650,000

432
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:44,519
plants um that is involving 525 cases

433
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:48,198
just just say and that was in The Last

434
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:50,198
Five Years on there so the the hopeful

435
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:52,278
with this is that we move forward and

436
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:54,039
and the different areas work together

437
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,000
the other thing is with these regulatory

438
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:58,318
commissions with the Department of

439
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,639
Justice years back we had the Bureau of

440
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:02,719
Narcotics enforcement as a regulatory

441
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,439
arm with them that would probably be

442
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,640
very helpful in having a a creation of

443
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,600
that again to help work with these

444
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,480
bureaus in the uh dealing with these

445
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:16,318
issues thank

446
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,480
you ATF or something okay thank you

447
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,279
thank you for your testimony why don't

448
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,318
we uh just get the questions right where

449
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,439
we left off with Public Safety and you

450
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:24,639
know I'm just curious to see what you

451
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,519
guys are doing uh locally you you've

452
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,038
mentioned uh some of the things I know

453
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,000
you mentioned perhaps from the previous

454
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,000
panel we talked about the uh the

455
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,119
advisory committee and so I would

456
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,240
imagine you guys would want to play a

457
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:39,678
part in the advisory committee I know

458
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,798
when you said you went to Colorado was a

459
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,080
task force but here in California we

460
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:45,519
have that advisory committee so

461
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,519
hopefully we can uh see if we can

462
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,918
connect that I would imagine law

463
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,240
enforcement would want to be a part of

464
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,640
the advisory committee uh just given the

465
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,000
amount of questions I always get back

466
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,640
home I would imagine you get the same

467
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,038
questions as well throughout the entire

468
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,679
State and throughout your associations

469
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:03,558
question centers around for the local

470
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:06,480
land use and for our law enforcement

471
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:09,240
professionals um how we ensure that we

472
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,000
don't have a mild distribution of

473
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,919
marijuana related activities let me

474
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,798
speak specifically to what I'm concerned

475
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,520
about in the area of Los Angeles that I

476
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:22,839
represent known as South Los Angeles we

477
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,759
have too many liquor stores so much so

478
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:28,119
that we have a moratorium on New on and

479
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,359
offsite liquor licensing and we have

480
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:32,079
substantial

481
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,399
conditions as a part of getting a new

482
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,158
license or renewing a license or even

483
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,120
the transfer of a license that process

484
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,320
includes our local planning department

485
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,479
and the state Alcohol Beverage Control

486
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:46,918
Commission and there's effectively a

487
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:50,079
moratorium on the issuance of new

488
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:53,480
licenses despite that we still have

489
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:56,678
concentrations of liquor in South Los

490
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:00,159
Angeles that are disproportionately high

491
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:02,880
to the population it require eventually

492
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:05,640
that we change state law how do we

493
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,799
prevent marijuana businesses

494
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,400
particularly the retail customer facing

495
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:12,960
businesses that's the great concern that

496
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:16,720
I have for as an urban legislator from

497
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,919
being overc concentrated in certain

498
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,640
communities well let me if I don't mind

499
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,759
I'll go first on this in the visit to

500
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,720
Colorado that is a strong concern and

501
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:27,200
problem they actually do have with that

502
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,480
the concentration in the lower economic

503
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,000
areas and urban areas

504
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,480
of the city the cities is where the

505
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,679
highly concentrated areas of these s so

506
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,480
with local local bands the ability to

507
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,559
the local bands and the regulations on

508
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,319
that we can they can probably start

509
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,678
specifying specific areas of how many

510
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:49,038
per area to grow which was the

511
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,159
opportunity we will need to do okay I'll

512
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,679
just jump in really quick Cara Martinson

513
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:54,120
with um the California State Association

514
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,080
of counties I think that's an excellent

515
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:58,279
point and I think that was really sort

516
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,240
of the Genesis of our local control

517
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,798
argument

518
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,159
within specifically prop 64 it's

519
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:06,359
extremely important for local

520
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,400
jurisdictions to decide a do they want

521
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:11,519
to regulate or do they want to ban they

522
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,080
need to um make that decision uh from

523
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,440
the will of the community if you will uh

524
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:19,240
and then what that local land use and

525
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,720
and Zoning looks like and that is um a

526
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,038
process that a lot of folks are going

527
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,480
through now at the local level uh

528
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,480
identifying sensitive use areas

529
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,759
obviously we don't want these facilities

530
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,200
next to schools or children or other

531
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,119
areas so uh that is in some instances we

532
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,519
don't want these facilities honestly

533
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:40,678
near anybody and not in any substitute

534
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:43,679
in any substantial concentration so my

535
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:47,400
question would be is there a deficiency

536
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,919
in the adult medical use act prop 64

537
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,798
that might invite State legislation that

538
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,200
says per capita you don't have more than

539
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,639
x amount of dispensaries is it a

540
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,080
thousand people is it is it in relation

541
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,360
to a physical place that you're talking

542
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:04,960
about sensitive use because that's my

543
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:07,319
concern that Western Avenue crenchaw

544
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,440
Boulevard Pico and Olympic are going to

545
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:13,399
be concentrated by more and more

546
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,278
nuisance businesses if I could respond U

547
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,840
most of

548
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:20,720
these is on yeah there we go thank you

549
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,038
um most of the retail businesses are

550
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,960
going to be located within

551
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,640
municipalities and this is where local

552
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,038
control comes in uh it is critically

553
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,520
important and we tell

554
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,759
uh the league is going around doing

555
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:36,319
trainings to various cities for the prop

556
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:38,960
64 as we did for the medical act and we

557
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:40,798
tell them that if you are interested in

558
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,480
controlling this problem it is

559
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,798
absolutely critical and we very often

560
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,319
point to the city of Oakland because the

561
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:49,240
the problem you're absolutely right the

562
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:51,599
problem with liquor stores we don't want

563
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,960
uh repeated on uh with respect to

564
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,359
marijuana dispensaries uh there's been

565
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,000
criticism about the number of liquor

566
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:01,599
stores and over concentration there is

567
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,640
an over concentration statute uh in the

568
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:07,000
uh code governing the establishment of

569
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,240
liquor licenses which to the best of my

570
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,679
knowledge has rarely have ever been

571
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,079
enforced that uh basically it says a

572
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,278
license shall not be issued if there are

573
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,278
concerns about overc concentration that

574
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:20,558
statute has been copied into both the

575
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:24,359
medical act and prop 64 but the real

576
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:27,359
solution is for locals to be strategic

577
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:29,038
about uh how they allow these businesses

578
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,639
into their communities if they're going

579
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,079
to allow them and we urg cities to take

580
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,159
a page from City of Oakland what they

581
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:38,158
did they were very strategic about it

582
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:40,880
they adopted a per Capal formula for how

583
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,520
many dispensaries they would ultimately

584
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,360
have so if you do that one per 35,000

585
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,200
residents or what have you you will

586
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,038
never have an explosion of businesses

587
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,558
that outgrows your ability to regulate

588
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:55,038
it the other thing we caution cities is

589
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:57,519
whether it's a numerical cap or a per

590
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,640
capital formula it is important to set

591
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,839
some kind of a cap because you do not

592
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,080
want uh bearing in mind that this is

593
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,278
still an all cash business you you're

594
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,000
going to have to do audits for a couple

595
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:10,519
of reasons you're going to want to have

596
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,440
a a handle on the amount of traffic the

597
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:14,079
amount of product that's being moved the

598
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,798
amount of Revenue that's being generated

599
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,399
and if you have a local tax in place you

600
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:19,278
are also going to want to know if the

601
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,919
city is getting its fair share of the

602
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:23,200
revenue based on the total volume of

603
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,520
traffic you will know none of that

604
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,840
unless you have an audit protocol that

605
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,038
is set up to audit 100% of the

606
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,000
businesses

607
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,200
in your jurisdiction on a regular basis

608
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,440
one of the problems they had in Denver

609
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,038
Colorado is they were passing out

610
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,880
permits like hot cakes in the Denver

611
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,599
metropolitan area and the the scope of

612
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,760
the businesses and the traffic quickly

613
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,079
outgrew the ability to audit it and the

614
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,720
FEDS had to come in and do a sting

615
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:49,240
operation so we caution folks to be very

616
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,640
cautious be strategic if you want a tax

617
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,038
measure put it on the local ballot make

618
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,240
sure it's prop 218 compliant but have a

619
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,480
formula for the number of businesses you

620
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,079
will ultimately have in your

621
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,679
jurisdiction that's the answer to the

622
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:04,158
question it's a question of local

623
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,798
control but the see so I represent uh uh

624
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,480
three municipalities uh portion of the

625
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:12,319
city of Englewood the entirety of the

626
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,400
city of Culver City and uh about 200 or

627
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,240
almost 300,000 people in the city of Los

628
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,278
Angeles in the city of Los Angeles there

629
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,558
are five council districts that touch

630
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:21,440
the assembly district that I have the

631
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:24,038
privilege to represent each of those

632
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,880
council districts are driven by land use

633
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:29,158
uh decisions primarily connected to the

634
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,640
local representative and at the time and

635
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,679
place so if a local representative is

636
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,000
interested in seeing many of these

637
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,640
permits issued because of local control

638
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,038
and we seed that authority to them uh

639
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,159
and they leave office and like liquor

640
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:46,079
stores we end up with a overc

641
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:48,760
concentration if that statute was copied

642
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,839
into the adult medical use act that we

643
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:54,440
have uh fatal flaws with respect to uh

644
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:59,038
overc concentration issue

645
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:01,440
because in areas it is it is easy to see

646
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,679
it doesn't even take critical analysis

647
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,120
to see the concentration of liquor and

648
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,399
before our proposition D locally which

649
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,479
significantly

650
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:14,639
reduced um uh dispensaries in particular

651
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,679
we had an over concentration all

652
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,000
throughout South Los Angeles so for the

653
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,240
committee chairs and I know that the

654
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,759
local government committee chairs here

655
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,558
this is something that I will be working

656
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,480
on very closely with each of you to the

657
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:29,079
extent that you care to because I'm

658
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,278
afraid that my area and and areas

659
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:33,759
adjacent in South Los Angeles are going

660
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:37,200
to Bear the brunt of the retail

661
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:39,278
interaction with uh marijuana users and

662
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,519
dispensaries and they are nuisance

663
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:45,000
businesses and you cannot adequately

664
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,918
accommodate cleaning them up and it is

665
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,398
different in Los Angeles than anywhere

666
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,320
else the challenges and having cash

667
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:54,918
businesses is about the biggest nuisance

668
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,759
that anyone who lives in my area or has

669
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,720
been there for any period of time can

670
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:00,960
understand so that's the perspective of

671
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,960
this legisl who represents a quarter

672
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,000
roughly of South Los Angeles thank you

673
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,519
Mr chairman thank you Mr Ridley Thomas

674
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,839
and um you know I think we heard local

675
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,480
control is a big factor of it and from

676
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,038
our Public Safety also that local

677
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,679
control and I know uh from us was we're

678
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:17,319
working with the associations but also

679
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,440
with our locals as well making sure that

680
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:21,398
they have the proper ordinances in place

681
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,240
Miss cabier brought up a good point I

682
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:25,719
don't know if you want to State it so I

683
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,440
I have a question about who's going to

684
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,360
keep track of all all the local

685
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,600
jurisdictions and so that we know um

686
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,519
what it is that they're doing uh I I'm

687
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:39,000
with you on on this onec but the

688
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:41,240
regulatory structure for alcohol is

689
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,398
really different than what is in place

690
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,000
but we have to rely on our locals and

691
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:46,599
the only way we can do that is if we

692
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,240
know what it is that they've passed and

693
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:50,719
we know what it is that they're doing

694
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,679
and uh from my my perspective and my

695
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,798
jurisdiction one of the Mayors just

696
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:57,278
ended up being recalled because of the

697
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,879
vote of the council so the public is

698
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:01,200
paying a lot of attention

699
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,880
and they're getting very engaged and

700
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,558
they want to know they want to have some

701
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,840
control over this and they weren't happy

702
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,440
with their elected so is there somebody

703
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:10,119
that will be keeping track of all of the

704
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,600
different decisions that the locals make

705
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:16,119
and if there's change can change the um

706
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:18,918
the the um I'm I'm assuming it's going

707
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:21,119
to be a website or some kind of uh of of

708
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:22,799
page where you can get that information

709
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,398
there is uh and I I really appreciate

710
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,440
your comments because the police Chiefs

711
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,639
absolutely share your concern with

712
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,240
oversaturation I think there is a model

713
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,679
today uh the ABC for example the

714
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,839
regulatory agency that oversees liquor

715
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,240
licenses before a business can go to a

716
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:42,038
local community uh that local uh city

717
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,240
council uh and that police chief uh gets

718
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:46,720
that information from ABC and ABC and

719
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,759
the local have to agree on the the

720
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,919
number of licenses in their community

721
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:52,440
and and to ensure um that there's not

722
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,480
any oversaturation now they're

723
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,600
responsible to make sure that they deny

724
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,159
them if there is an over saturation but

725
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:01,158
there is that checks and balances with

726
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,960
liquor stores I hope that our regulatory

727
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:04,519
act going forward with marijuana will

728
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,919
include a similar model for those

729
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:08,640
communities that allow it well

730
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:11,038
unfortunately what happened is that

731
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,440
before that that uh process with the

732
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,398
locals was involved um ABC could could

733
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,080
uh award as many licenses as possible so

734
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,439
many of our communities are really

735
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,558
challenged because we already have over

736
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,679
concentration and it wasn't until the

737
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:28,240
public uh uh necessity um condition was

738
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,360
placed on local governments that it gave

739
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,359
local governments the opportunity to to

740
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:35,158
have that dialogue and to discuss it but

741
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:36,798
I'm I'm really looking globally at to as

742
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,000
to whether anybody is going to be

743
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,558
keeping data on what the different the

744
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,798
58 counties and the 400 and however many

745
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:46,599
cities that we have so that we can look

746
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:49,359
at it to see what it is that has been

747
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:51,319
done um within the state of California

748
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,439
just for our own purposes and that's an

749
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:55,158
excellent point um I think uh in

750
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,240
addition to our associations that are

751
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:00,200
working to do that uh there is a need

752
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,399
think for an entity uh at the state

753
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,000
level there is a advisory committee as

754
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:08,119
was stated that's required by uh 64 uh

755
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,599
but the the local licensing piece isn't

756
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:13,558
clear in 64 as it is in the mcrsa and so

757
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:16,119
we're waiting to see what those draft

758
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:18,319
regulations look like uh obviously the

759
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:20,918
state cannot issue a license that's in

760
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,000
conflict with the local ordinance uh but

761
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:24,360
how they find that out and who keeps

762
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,599
that information and what that looks

763
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:28,798
like is extremely important as we move

764
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:30,918
forward but I seesack and the league I

765
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,839
know are committed uh to working on this

766
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:36,200
issue and we do have ideas uh uh about

767
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,480
how we can fill that void yeah I think

768
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,798
what we're trying to do is make sure we

769
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,519
don't all collect this information and

770
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:45,398
keep it within our own Association when

771
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,519
obviously there's a a bigger uh need to

772
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:49,719
share that information with everyone and

773
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,038
perhaps uh Miss Ajax will help

774
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,960
coordinate some of that when she's

775
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,240
drafting the regulations see who's doing

776
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,720
what but that we'd have to ensure at the

777
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,399
state level that we're not in conflict

778
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,600
with the locals as well and so uh Mr

779
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:03,678
wood has a additional question well

780
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,798
actually just more of a a comment and

781
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,080
obviously as we see wait to see the how

782
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:11,679
how this plays out with the certainly

783
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,759
mcrsa was very very had a very different

784
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,960
Vision than prop 64 around local control

785
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:16,919
some of the some of those issues so

786
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,159
we'll see how this how this plays out

787
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,399
and so as someone who worked on that

788
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:23,159
I've I have a vested interest in in in

789
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:24,839
in that as well but I would just like to

790
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,519
comment too that you know and I

791
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:28,000
appreciate I appreciate my colleague and

792
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:29,399
the challenges they're obviously having

793
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,398
in Los Angeles and in some of his

794
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:34,038
neighborhoods however there are other

795
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:35,719
jurisdictions cities and counties who

796
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:38,679
have have taken a different approaches

797
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,319
who have seen that that while the the

798
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:42,159
businesses that some of the businesses

799
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,599
may be nuisances in in in your

800
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,200
neighborhoods they've actually been good

801
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,480
corporate citizens and Cooperative with

802
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,759
jurisdictions in other in other areas

803
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,240
and so uh it's not it's it's not all bad

804
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:53,079
it's it's actually there there are a lot

805
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,759
of folks that are actually good

806
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:56,119
corporate citizens and and and play well

807
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:57,638
with their communities are actually

808
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:00,558
embraced by their communities for for

809
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:02,879
what do so so how we marry that all

810
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,960
together and um and and make it work but

811
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,600
I would agree that I don't think anybody

812
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,079
wants to see an overc concentration of

813
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:12,519
anything and the liquor laws I mean I

814
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:16,038
represent a city uh that that has 25

815
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:18,079
tasting rooms downtown uh for wine and

816
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:20,319
and uh and while everybody talks about

817
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:23,158
overc concentration and and the ABC

818
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:25,038
regulations that's never come into play

819
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:26,559
it's never been an issue and you know

820
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:28,599
there there'll be another another one or

821
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:29,960
two that are probably approved this year

822
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:33,079
because because that's the nature of the

823
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,240
Beast so how we approach this this is is

824
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,678
uh is going to be very interesting going

825
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,638
forward so thank you thank you so I

826
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,038
think this issues was raised in the last

827
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:40,398
panel and this panel so obviously

828
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:42,480
there's a lot of interest from the

829
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,599
legislature and making sure how this is
