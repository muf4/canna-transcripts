1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,359
what has it look like for businesses to

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,910
work with one another to set up these

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,039
agreements to set up contracts to ensure

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,490
that there are products on the shelves

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:16,500
and I'm sure there was disruption when

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,320
we went through these various moments

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,698
January 1 2018 I know in the city of Los

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,289
Angeles there was a lot of disruption so

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,609
I want to hear from Pamela first and

10
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,000
then Jared I'd like to hear from you as

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:33,120
well we've seen with our operators that

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,130
legacy operators and early adopters tend

13
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,199
to have the most difficulty here because

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,359
they're used to saying this is somebody

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,190
I trust they're used to saying you know

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,200
I didn't put things in writing because

17
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:46,729
that was evidence and that was evidence

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,219
that I was teetering in this you know

19
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:53,788
almost regulated limited immunity

20
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,039
whatever it is that these times had and

21
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,410
so it's really coming around to this

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,750
sensibility of what is traditional

23
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:03,898
regular business we have this

24
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,269
conversation a lot what do other heavily

25
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,939
regulated industries do we're not

26
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:11,340
reinventing the wheel in cannabis we are

27
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:15,149
simply adding another widget to a

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,359
commodities market and so contracting is

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,640
the cornerstone and the fundamentals of

30
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,590
good business because there are

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,819
provisions and there are things that are

32
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,829
coming as we march towards ever close

33
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,048
our full legalization at the federal

34
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:32,819
level what does that mean that means you

35
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,590
can get to federal court when we're

36
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,478
talking about negligence claims and

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,850
we're talking about products liabilities

38
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,250
claims that are coming there are things

39
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:44,509
like treble damages that happen when you

40
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,009
can get into a federal situation so

41
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:50,399
they're looming they're waiting we've

42
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,978
seen prop 65 lawsuits that are coming

43
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,009
you've got to be ahead of it you've got

44
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,868
to know that when you're a retailer if

45
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,759
you're contracting or you're a

46
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:02,489
manufacturer and you're contracting to

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,769
get flour how that flour is getting to

48
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,408
you where is the custody and control who

49
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:10,919
is in control of it who is responsible

50
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,210
if there is a rate an accident

51
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,709
hijacking who is

52
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,030
responsible for this product are you

53
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,650
covered from an insurance perspective

54
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:23,280
who where does it go if you're using a

55
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:26,849
transport only licensee they can't hold

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,039
custody to the product so on one end of

57
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:32,009
that transaction somebody's covering

58
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,019
when somebody else is moving physically

59
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:36,539
moving the product when you're talking

60
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,939
about our QA QC procedures here in

61
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,739
California protect the consumer that's

62
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,680
what they're driven to do so the point

63
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,390
of testing is right before it gets B to

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,189
C that's when the distributor's

65
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:48,959
responsibility that means if you're a

66
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:52,109
man if you're a cultivator and you're

67
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,659
selling product to a manufacturer where

68
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,760
that product may get contaminated if

69
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,129
it's that it's clean when it left the

70
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,389
cultivators but by the time it gets the

71
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:02,159
manufacturer and the manufacturer

72
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,299
doesn't test it before they manufacture

73
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,430
it and all the sudden it gets

74
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,770
concentrated and at the end of the line

75
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,469
at tests dirty whose responsibility is

76
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,680
that that's a contract term that's where

77
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:16,400
you need to be panning out all of these

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,580
different levels of how you interface

79
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,980
together as a supply chain making sure

80
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,830
that the excise tax is collected and

81
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:28,079
paid you are responsible from the state

82
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,780
agency's perspective for everything that

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,660
you do and everything that it goes along

84
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,340
the pivot points on the supply chain so

85
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:39,090
you're gonna want to know that everybody

86
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,710
else in that line is doing the same

87
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,200
thing you are and the best way to

88
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,770
protect yourself and your business is

89
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,959
through these agreements and it's a

90
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:51,420
difficult lift it is not easy it is

91
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,240
expensive you're going to start to see

92
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:57,419
the prices coming down working with a

93
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,820
good lawyer you get a what I'd like to

94
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,369
say is a suite of agreements that then

95
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,799
you're just tearing off of so if you're

96
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,020
a vendor ask a distributor to send you a

97
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,610
distribution agreement don't read it

98
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,219
read it yourself

99
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,470
have your lawyer read it go through what

100
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,359
red lines you want to do and then have a

101
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:17,639
meaningful conversation we're all

102
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,730
figuring it out that's the great part

103
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,250
about this industry is it is community

104
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,960
based we've most of us have been here

105
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,939
we're working through these issues

106
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,759
together

107
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:31,519
use it as a collaborative framework but

108
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:35,209
please don't cut the fat when it comes

109
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:38,060
to your legal representation and putting

110
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:41,509
down on paper where responsibilities

111
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:44,180
liabilities and warranties go when we're

112
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:47,149
talking about packaging and labeling and

113
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,569
where that little California universal

114
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:52,639
symbol needs to go and the primary panel

115
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:54,649
this is my plea there are four things

116
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,139
I know branding we just talked about

117
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:59,029
being very expensive your logo is not

118
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:03,680
one of the four things that needs to be

119
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:05,709
on the front of your product I'm sorry I

120
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,990
understand I have this conversation

121
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:12,049
several times a day it isn't it's the

122
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,629
net weight in US and foreign metrics it

123
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:18,290
is the universal California symbol which

124
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:20,420
should be in scale size to your logo it

125
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,819
should not be the tiniest thing with

126
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,370
your big logo and then you've got to

127
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:26,689
name your product a vape cartridge is

128
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,870
not correct

129
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:32,930
it's a cannabis vape cartridge needs to

130
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,449
identify the product name and it needs

131
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,790
to be on the part of your product with

132
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:39,889
the ordinary course of business that a

133
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,840
consumer sees I'm sure that Jerrod and

134
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,699
Adam go through this all the time when

135
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,279
you're checking these products do you

136
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:49,159
take them into your store do you run the

137
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:51,619
risk of the BCC coming in and somebody

138
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,600
saying hey they're getting easier and

139
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,399
easier to identify I don't know if

140
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,410
jarred and out and went away in but

141
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:00,620
these days I walk into a dispensary you

142
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:03,530
can zero in on a non-compliant package

143
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,019
much more quickly so this isn't the time

144
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:08,899
to play around it's the time to contract

145
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:11,240
put all the terms in writing make sure

146
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:13,370
you understand what they are evidence

147
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,120
that you're meeting all of these other

148
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,668
ancillary regulatory protocols and then

149
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,209
you can go about the business of being

150
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:26,560
profitable and being ready to survive

151
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:26,560
into 2019
