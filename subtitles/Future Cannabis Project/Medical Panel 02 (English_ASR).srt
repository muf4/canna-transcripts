1
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,960
so why is that well it

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:26,539
look at cannabis there's about how many

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,560
cannabinoids are we up to now anybody

4
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:32,149
you know so you know people say 120

5
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,649
whatever pick a number but it's

6
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:36,049
something over a hundred now

7
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:39,350
cannabinoids are active ingredients in

8
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:42,588
the cannabis plant well so go ahead name

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:45,800
off a couple of cannabinoids THC CBD

10
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:48,619
they're getting the press but then

11
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:52,399
there's a whole bunch more like CPG in

12
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:55,280
CBN and CBC and THC a and all these ones

13
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,018
with funny names and turns out that if

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,689
you look at them closely and that's

15
00:00:57,018 --> 00:01:02,869
starting to happen that the properties

16
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:05,959
they have multiple properties also so I

17
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:07,640
was just taking a look at CB G's can of

18
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:10,639
it all just for the fun of it and

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,489
noticing that if you look at the added

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,209
it's practically a match up for THC and

21
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:17,539
CBD

22
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:21,618
as far as that eight or ten properties

23
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:24,978
that have been recognized so far in CB g

24
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:28,519
well CPG is virtually an unknown player

25
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:31,390
right I mean it's and then CBC is it

26
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,709
they're all except for THC and CBD

27
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,049
simply take let's say there's a honey

28
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:39,140
there's 100 cannabinoids we have two

29
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:41,269
players okay and the rest are you know

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,920
ride the bench and or either never

31
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:45,409
signed up or I don't know you know if

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,939
you use a baseball analogy the rest a

33
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:48,799
bunch of riding the bench and then a

34
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:54,219
bunch of never even heard of the game so

35
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:58,969
so we're sort of partway into this and

36
00:01:54,219 --> 00:02:02,118
let's take to CBD for a second okay back

37
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:03,379
to the good old CBD cannabidiol so you

38
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:06,409
all know what this is you haven't

39
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:09,409
putting those with CBD is right so CBD

40
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:11,090
was in for us help me out here if I

41
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:14,329
screw something up okay

42
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:18,200
CBD was was discovered to be in the

43
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:20,420
cannabis plant and in well centuries ago

44
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:23,929
is in pretty good amounts then plants

45
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:26,000
were bred for THC and CBD was forgotten

46
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,819
didn't seem to have a yes then it was

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,370
rediscovered then it was found that it

48
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,180
had all these amazing properties some of

49
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,519
which we can share with you

50
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,219
and then plants started getting bread

51
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,400
for CBD so I want to really emphasize

52
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:44,280
that plants were bred for higher CBD and

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,000
higher and higher so that's been

54
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,239
happening and that's going to happen

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,068
with other cannabinoids and it's not

56
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,200
only gonna happen with cannabis it's

57
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:57,208
gonna happen with him they're already

58
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,848
doing that messing around

59
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,430
breeding hemp nope there's also a source

60
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:03,959
of CBD well it turns out it's got a lot

61
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,450
of other little cannabinoids hanging out

62
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,340
in it and you can breathe that for those

63
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:10,979
in that there's people doing that too

64
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,039
just to keep your eyes open on that so

65
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:17,459
we got that going on so if you kind of

66
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:21,798
look at how far CBDs come well when they

67
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:24,180
start breeding CBG and XYZ cannabinoids

68
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,359
what's gonna happen well it's just gonna

69
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:31,290
I would I don't even know Drupal or

70
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:34,980
whatever quadrupled the uses of cannabis

71
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:37,168
and hemp it's like you kind of get that

72
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:41,429
kind of get that drift yet where we're

73
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:43,620
going with this it's like let's see okay

74
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:49,969
let's do the properties of CBD go ahead

75
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:53,989
call them out yeah yeah it's anxiety

76
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:57,590
uh-huh anti pain neuro protective

77
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:59,759
protective of neurons in the brain

78
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:03,150
neurogenesis is able to create help

79
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:06,149
create new neurons and on and on like

80
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,370
that so so now all those properties of

81
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:12,269
CBD were not known when CBD came out

82
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:17,239
correct and I think some of the one of

83
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:24,090
the more exciting ones if you're gonna

84
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:26,549
mention it yeah who we're gonna the

85
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:28,439
mention is it's what we're learning the

86
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,740
CBD has elite effects that we really

87
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:33,249
didn't know why because CBD actually

88
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,189
doesn't interact with a lot of

89
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:37,389
abra receptors in the same way yeah one

90
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:41,559
of the things that's been discovered

91
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:44,259
recently is CBD D is a powerful reuptake

92
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:46,649
inhibitor and some of that can you have

93
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:48,908
to be careful well do we find in the

94
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:51,309
kids with seizures because it'll

95
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:53,348
actually prevent some anti-seizure drugs

96
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:55,239
from being metabolized right which can

97
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:57,848
be a problem so CBD is not gonna harm

98
00:04:55,238 --> 00:05:00,038
you but if we have the benzodiazepines

99
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:01,688
raising in your system that those to

100
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:04,118
potentially harm but what they're

101
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:07,179
finding with the anti-anxiety some of

102
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:09,610
the depression benefits people plant

103
00:05:07,178 --> 00:05:11,888
some CBD it also works as a relay

104
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:15,369
converter for our natural endogenous

105
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:17,709
cannabinoids so you know I know how down

106
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:18,789
the science road we want to get but I'm

107
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:20,499
sure everyone here has heard of the

108
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:22,988
endocannabinoids system and we know that

109
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:24,429
our body produces endogenous

110
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:26,338
cannabinoids weaning from within the

111
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:28,658
body it's nothing to do with cannabis

112
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:31,238
people are relatively familiar with an

113
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:34,748
and amide and to Iraq the Dino glycerol

114
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:37,359
there's others Paul McCoy of'em ethanol

115
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:40,539
mine some other sits that are not as

116
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,759
well known but what CBD actually they're

117
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:45,158
finding is doing is it's slowing the

118
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,199
body's ability to react take Amanda mine

119
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:49,498
and to a record I know glycerol so

120
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,968
they're having this buildup in the body

121
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:53,499
that is actually allowing the body to

122
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,728
utilize your natural endogenous

123
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:57,389
cannabinoids

124
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:59,378
so it's indirectly raising the

125
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:02,139
cannabinoids in your body that someone

126
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:03,959
might be deficient in and has this

127
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:06,728
amazing effects because if your

128
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,379
endogenous cannabinoids are raised it's

129
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:10,928
gonna be able to correct at a higher

130
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:11,500
rate malfunctions of the pre or post

131
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:12,969
synaptic

132
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,759
nerves that could be causing the

133
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,770
balances and in all the hormones and

134
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,420
neurotransmitters that you know make us

135
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:21,789
happy make us sad make this function

136
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,470
right so if those if those errors aren't

137
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,450
happening correctly that's where a lot

138
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,060
of depression and anxiety and sleep

139
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:29,979
issues come from them by just taking CBD

140
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,509
as a supplement you're going to

141
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,180
naturally lose those endogenous

142
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:35,860
cannabinoids in the body and that's

143
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,750
really recent in the last year - they've

144
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:58,990
really really learned that what's the

145
00:06:37,750 --> 00:07:01,120
excitement what well CBD specifically

146
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,100
that has that effect

147
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,180
THC doesn't have every application fact

148
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,080
that we know of

149
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,240
I mean we're learning something new

150
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,469
every day so by the time someone watches

151
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,900
this they go yeah it goes just

152
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,340
discovering revenue as far as we know it

153
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:14,679
doesn't have that effect so I would

154
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:16,959
think that you know if you're using a

155
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,668
mixed balanced strain you know you're

156
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,689
going to be the higher the heat the

157
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:21,939
plant can only produce so many

158
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,709
cannabinoids so the higher the CHC the

159
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:25,540
less CBD you're gonna end up getting and

160
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:28,029
other types of contaminants and I would

161
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,550
just have one more thing when we're

162
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:32,500
talking about CVG and CBC and you know

163
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:37,120
the variants are really exciting what

164
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:39,639
we're learning about THC and CBD B those

165
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,100
are also why it's important to realize

166
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,668
that not every patient is gonna benefit

167
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,439
from these ultra purified CBD products

168
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:50,379
whether they're from him or whether it's

169
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,728
epidemics because a lot of the benefit

170
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:54,490
is coming from things that we're just

171
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:55,990
we're assuming or CBD but then we

172
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,250
finally when we get into these purified

173
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,750
products they don't have the same

174
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,240
efficacy and I think we're gonna find

175
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,430
down the road that it is from the the

176
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,250
barians and the CBC's and the CB

177
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,990
and we haven't even gotten into

178
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,240
flavonoids and terpenoids but these this

179
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:13,840
see some Russo coin this entourage

180
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,699
effects of compounds that is flies in

181
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,079
the face of what the way we like to

182
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:20,170
think about medicine in Western medicine

183
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,629
you know is really also important to

184
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,730
realize why we as patient advocates

185
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,740
don't want to say well epidemics is out

186
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:29,230
so kids with epilepsy were fun right

187
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,060
because it's not that simple at all and

188
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:33,700
a lot of those kids my son included

189
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,259
don't respond the CBD alone at all never

190
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,780
did never help the single day it wasn't

191
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:39,720
until we started adding different ratio

192
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,250
medicines that he started to respond

193
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,250
Forrest is referring to the entourage

194
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:48,480
effect that Ethan Rousseau the a very

195
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:51,309
good neurologist came up with it's the

196
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,289
combined effect of all the ingredients

197
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:56,289
in a cannabis plant on a particular

198
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:57,969
person and at as we talked about there's

199
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:59,949
a lot of cannabinoids and then as you

200
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,480
mentioned there's terpenes so how many

201
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,030
of you know what the terpenes are just

202
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,850
offhand and yeah Turk means are the

203
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:09,069
aromatic part of the cannabis plant and

204
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,200
a whole lot of other plants there's lots

205
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,879
of them in in nature like in lemons and

206
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,670
black pepper and all that they give it

207
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:19,269
the smell off they also have properties

208
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:22,750
so terpenes have a busload of properties

209
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:25,389
what's ziggy several of more anti-tumor

210
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,370
some are anti-inflammatory some are

211
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:29,769
antidepressant what else we got guys

212
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,820
just offhand on the terpene I got my 13

213
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:37,210
list I ran it somewhere here we go

214
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:39,460
sedative let's see and some are anti

215
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:42,550
pain and things that you say like the

216
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:44,800
terpene thing is like a whole like here

217
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:45,159
we go kind of thing welcome to a new

218
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,069
world

219
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:49,600
good no I was just gonna say I think we

220
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,220
can add everything on the list because

221
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,720
we're talking about compounds that are

222
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,759
interacting with her and open advances

223
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,129
so everything that your inner family

224
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:59,259
system does which is regulate almost

225
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,590
every function in your body these

226
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:02,960
compounds are interacting

227
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,730
are going to benefit if they're

228
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,019
interacting with the area of the other

229
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,810
family system that is causing you

230
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:11,149
problems and you know that's like

231
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:12,649
cannabis and these terpenes and Long's

232
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:14,929
aren't a family system work as these

233
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:17,389
adapted but people see these very

234
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:19,159
different results and it's because this

235
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:21,129
system regulates so many different

236
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:25,189
things that depending on how our

237
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:27,470
physiology and biology are individually

238
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,980
structured you know we're gonna see

239
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,330
different results to it so malfunctions

240
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,310
in that system could be causing sleep

241
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,970
issues or not but it's it's the fact

242
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:39,919
that it's not necessarily taking a

243
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,720
terpenoid or a cannabinoid for sleep

244
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,309
specifically what we're taking it for is

245
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,440
to correct the malfunctions within the

246
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:48,649
system in our body and then that you see

247
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,839
the the benefits of it when that error

248
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:53,209
in that system is corrected and it ties

249
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:57,589
in those errors can be a spectrum of

250
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:58,970
things sleep pain etc so it really for a

251
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:00,980
lot of these we're gonna be able to list

252
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,410
all of the same things because these

253
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,720
different compounds are gonna likely

254
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:08,959
interact with what is not working for

255
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,940
specific people in different ways so

256
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,889
that can go into the genetics of that

257
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,300
person which everybody's getting more

258
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:16,519
interested in genetics which is great

259
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:20,149
and so some of these people are gonna

260
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:22,429
have deficiencies in there and the

261
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:24,199
cannabinoid system and they're not going

262
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:26,539
to have as many receptors in the gut or

263
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,330
the uterus that you have or whatever and

264
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:33,110
by the way there's a lot of receptors in

265
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:36,050
the body I think I saw that the uterus

266
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,539
has the most concentration of receptors

267
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:40,849
you get that somewhere yeah most

268
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:44,120
concentration of cannabinoid receptors

269
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,909
in the body which is perhaps why canids

270
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,100
works so well for menstrual cramps and

271
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:51,319
it even works I wanted to just throw

272
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,570
this in for the ladies as a salve

273
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,930
topically put it on your lower abdomen

274
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:59,930
of the women I've looked at about 32 out

275
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:02,870
of 33 benefited from using topical

276
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:04,338
cannabis on the lower abdomen at the

277
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,919
onset of menstrual cramps you know how

278
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:09,160
does that work

279
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:12,159
I'm not sure how the hell that works but

280
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:13,750
it's working really well so there you go

281
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,819
you need got all these receptors and you

282
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,009
got a lot of them in the gut which is

283
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,220
why cannabis has been working when I

284
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:23,289
take cannabis I mean in this broad sense

285
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,028
has been working for irritable bowel

286
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:26,469
syndrome and ulcerative colitis and

287
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:30,549
Crohn's and all that stuff

288
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,899
sometimes it spectacularly so the sky's

289
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,689
limit on this

290
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:37,778
everybody that's that's what what I'm

291
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:40,839
seeing and let me let me run you just a

292
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:43,778
quick list of some of the conditions

293
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:47,769
that have responded to cannabinoids

294
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:49,870
right well pain anxiety and sleep on a

295
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:52,060
pain anxiety sleep those are the big

296
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,948
players reason people have come in and

297
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:55,869
see me for years to get there

298
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:59,528
cannabis approval when we needed that

299
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:03,070
and then there's Parkinson's and there's

300
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:05,439
ALS Lou Gehrig's disease and by the way

301
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,579
it's a pretty decent science going on

302
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,820
with this all right

303
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:14,859
then there's autism bladder dysfunction

304
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:20,920
and spasm depression glaucoma a DD and

305
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:23,169
ADHD cancer psoriasis and dementia they

306
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:24,849
also did a recent of migraines it just

307
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,429
goes on and on they just did a recent

308
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,959
study showing that they took a bunch of

309
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:31,149
people I don't you saw anybody either

310
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,439
you guys saw the study I just saw anyway

311
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:34,269
interesting little study they took a

312
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,920
bunch of people who had a bunch of

313
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:39,070
medical disorders and on a bunch of meds

314
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:41,019
and they gave in cannabis 29 those

315
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:44,199
twenty to one four three three or four

316
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:46,539
months game a twenty to one CBD just so

317
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:50,049
you don't get lost the numbers on the

318
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:52,480
CPD's are CPD to THC so there's thirty

319
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:55,059
to one twenty two one two one two one

320
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,879
all that so just they don't get lost and

321
00:13:55,059 --> 00:14:00,099
there we start throwing out the numbers

322
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:03,549
22 ones are real popular for a teen who

323
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:07,149
wants real popular variety and get some

324
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:10,629
study so they gave this for a while and

325
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:12,850
the people's brainpower their cognition

326
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:15,100
their thinking improved and they

327
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:18,639
measured it not only with these standard

328
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:21,550
these functional MRIs fancy fancy

329
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:25,000
