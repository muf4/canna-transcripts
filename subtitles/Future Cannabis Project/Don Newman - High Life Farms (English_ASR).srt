1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,250
my name is don newman

2
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:09,990
i'm currently the director of

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,960
cultivations for highlight farms in

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,638
Chesaning michigan previously resided in

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,618
Denver Colorado where I was the head

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:20,009
grower for the herbal cure I was brought

7
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:23,009
here to help get the grow going and

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,900
online and also just help with expansion

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,609
and moving forward with the company so

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,640
can you kind of talk about the execution

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,609
of that like

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,740
how big is the grow operation what was

13
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:37,200
the build-out process like what do you

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,600
like to see you get to put input into

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,210
like what lights we use what grow media

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,010
we use but absolutely is the director of

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,960
cultivation those are things that you

18
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,049
all have to design you know and what we

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,219
do is like a yearly schedule as well so

20
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:52,579
everything's very detailed and specific

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,890
nothing is just kind of on a whim right

22
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:57,599
so when it comes to big investments and

23
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,120
big companies all this stuff needs to be

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,469
planned out so it's very important to to

25
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,689
plan it out and have a good team in

26
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,170
place so you know as far as the

27
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:09,090
build-out goes it was it was an old

28
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,040
auction facility you know and they they

29
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,590
had like old tractors and stuff so the

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,509
old building that we kind of revamped

31
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,189
right eighty thousand square feet and

32
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,290
inside that building we have a

33
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,478
production facility we have an

34
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,859
extraction facility right so we have two

35
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,019
companies as well that are associated

36
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,569
with highlight farms and then we have a

37
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:31,439
10,000 square foot indoor grow right now

38
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:34,829
that currently has four Class C 15-under

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,929
plant licenses and it's so it's six

40
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,599
thousand plants total and we just

41
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,650
finished 17,000 square foot greenhouse

42
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:47,689
that will house 7,500 plants as well we

43
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:50,549
have plans for expansion to another

44
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:52,379
7,500 indoor plants so for that facility

45
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,270
alone when we're setting done we're

46
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,599
looking at 22,000 plants will be

47
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:59,310
maintaining their what we do is when we

48
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,949
design those facilities we look at how

49
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,719
we how we operate right it is a very

50
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,420
kind of California we're more of a SIA

51
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,389
green kind of maximize our canopy right

52
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,959
so we use more plants for light and we

53
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:14,429
should do a shorter veg time right but

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,049
for our method that's how we've always

55
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,140
been successful and that's what's worked

56
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:20,760
for us we grow biosynthetic Li you know

57
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,629
so it's a good mix of organic and

58
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,818
synthetic all biological IPM so once we

59
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:29,848
go to flower we don't spray and we use

60
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:33,479
you know predatory bugs to help combat

61
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:38,639
any kind of issues that you know we are

62
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:39,840
always prevented we're always excuse me

63
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,598
what's the word I'm looking for

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,158
we're proactive not reactive yes sir and

65
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,408
I think that's a big part of growing

66
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:48,628
right and another big part that I think

67
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:50,489
people don't understand is getting a

68
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:52,679
team of passionate people right because

69
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,709
anybody can grow cannabis but in order

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,140
to get the true quality that that that

71
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,120
homegrown quality that people love and

72
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,039
know you really have to put your heart

73
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,709
and soul into it and you have to find

74
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,719
passionate people and that takes some

75
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,459
time to do as well on a large scale you

76
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,289
know and we've been thankful that we

77
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,180
we've been able to find a very good team

78
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,888
of dedicated passionate employees and

79
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,939
we've been very successful so did you

80
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:18,820
bring a bunch of people from Denver

81
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:20,349
no no we did not bring a bunch of people

82
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:25,539
from Denver we've just been hiring

83
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:27,879
locally right and we have on the

84
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:30,400
cultivation side it's seven people just

85
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:33,250
for the to manage the indoor grow and

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,390
that's a manager and then a team lead

87
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:41,080
and then five employees and then we have

88
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:43,719
I want to say a harvest manager two

89
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,400
leads and about ten trimmers right so

90
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:49,210
they kind of helped with the harvest and

91
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:53,260
the teardown of the room so we how many

92
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:56,409
turns are you doing we won a nine week

93
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:59,590
cycle so we run anywhere from 63 to 68

94
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:02,469
days and so we'll do 21 harvests a year

95
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,360
and then between that in the greenhouse

96
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:08,259
it'll total 42 right because I'll each

97
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,630
be getting 21 so and what we've been

98
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:12,009
seeing we have 48 light rooms and we've

99
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:14,169
been averaging around three and a half

100
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:18,039
pounds of light so we're pooling usually

101
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:20,500
anywhere from 150 to 170 170 pounds of

102
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,830
room so we've been very successful with

103
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:27,629
the way we've been set up and we're

104
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:30,418
using right now phantom double ended to

105
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:34,389
flower under excuse me and then we do

106
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:37,359
LEC light emitting ceramic 315 watts for

107
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,800
veg but we're also trialing a lot of LED

108
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,480
products as well like we have some

109
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,770
Gavita some thrive Agrotech through this

110
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,270
little convention here we got hooked up

111
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:47,620
with Spyder so we're gonna be sampling

112
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:49,810
some of theirs I've seen a lot of great

113
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,399
success with their products so you know

114
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,660
I think there's a lot of opportunities

115
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,370
out there and that's the beautiful thing

116
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,200
about this industry is it keeps evolving

117
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,069
and there's always something more to

118
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,659
learn something

119
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:02,290
knew that you can gain from this right

120
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,689
can you talk about what you've noticed

121
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,980
because you have a you've worked with a

122
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:08,740
bunch of different types of lights like

123
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:11,410
specifically ceramic like what do you

124
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:15,790
like about it what's what I like about

125
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:17,800
its place in which it's growing if my

126
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,180
plants are happy I'm happy right so

127
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,490
that's what's important and what I like

128
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,980
is I like that the color rendering index

129
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,840
is 95 right so out of a hundred that's

130
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,150
the closest that they can mimic to

131
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,429
indoor sunlight so it's a very high

132
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:32,169
rating on that the plants seem to

133
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,189
respond very well to it it's a very

134
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,759
natural light

135
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:38,110
you get great resin production from it

136
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,509
you know and the plants seem to stack

137
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,270
very well they Bush out very well

138
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:44,769
same with leds leds I personally think

139
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:48,430
you get a little better internodal

140
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:49,990
spacing but you know just through all

141
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,329
these different kind of mediums and

142
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,189
being able to play like I'm not somebody

143
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:56,259
who's smarter than anybody I've just am

144
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:58,689
willing to try different things and I'm

145
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:01,060
not afraid to look stupid as far as

146
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:02,980
lighting is concerned you know there was

147
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,530
a lot in the beginning with LED there

148
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,939
was a lot of those spider-man lights if

149
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:08,469
you will the blue the red spectrum

150
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:11,350
they're kind of very harsh on the eyes

151
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,870
and they were very like cheap if you

152
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,900
will so kind of like turn people off to

153
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,420
the idea that LED could be competing in

154
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:21,729
this market right or be efficient but

155
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,319
you know since the last couple years

156
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,480
they've kind of you really seen the

157
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,250
progression of that and then the other

158
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,990
beautiful thing too is energy companies

159
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,790
will work with you because you're able

160
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,740
to give back to them and not take such a

161
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,900
demand on the grid that they'll pay for

162
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,970
half the costs nine times out of ten on

163
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:39,069
upgrading these lights right so it's a

164
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,490
huge savings right there not to mention

165
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,889
your electric bills and everything

166
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,900
but you know just the evolution of the

167
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,240
resin production the terpene profiles

168
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:50,399
and just really trying to get the full

169
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,220
potential the plant to be brought out in

170
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,109
doors just like it is outdoors right and

171
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,230
trying to mimic that sunlight I don't

172
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,030
think we'll ever fully get there but you

173
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,450
know that we've still got a ways to go

174
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:05,009
and a lot to learn but as far as you

175
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,139
know the future and what really excites

176
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:09,420
me is is greenhouse production I think

177
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,189
that's kind of the way of to be

178
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,689
efficient and as far as like you know

179
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:13,829
once we get bigger and bigger and bigger

180
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:16,319
right it's all going to be about

181
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:18,479
efficiency and who can provide the best

182
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,909
product at the cheapest cost right at

183
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,220
the cheapest cost per pound and I think

184
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,220
always when what is your cost per pound

185
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:32,069
and we have not had a harvest in the

186
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:33,599
greenhouse our first in outdoor our

187
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:36,060
first greenhouse harvest will be August

188
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,230
6 so we're actually gonna be

189
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,350
transplanting our first production

190
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:42,300
around July 1st so we're quite excited

191
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:46,400
for that but our indoor cost per pound

192
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,290
is it's a little proprietary honestly

193
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,539
that's something that it just do to you

194
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:54,300
know market demand pricing it's just

195
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,650
things that I guess like you know it's

196
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,900
something that we always work towards

197
00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:01,319
getting cheaper you know and I think

198
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:03,389
that no matter what when you care about

199
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,219
creating a good quality product you're

200
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,560
not necessarily worried about the cost

201
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,750
right so it's always important to be

202
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,040
efficient but at the same time it's

203
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,509
important to create a good quality

204
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,160
product because at the end of the day

205
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:16,918
good cannabis is always going to sell

206
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,720
itself this is a de Market that it's a

207
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:22,049
connoisseur market right and those are

208
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,000
your returning customers the you know

209
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,740
the larger companies who shoot for kind

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,470
of that

211
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,410
middle man mentality right hey let's

212
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,779
just try to pump out biomass there's a

213
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,950
market for that but those people are

214
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,470
going to come and go right those

215
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,300
connoisseur customers who loyally

216
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,889
returned to the dispensaries they want a

217
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:42,500
product that they can rely on right and

218
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:44,149
those are who we try to appeal to is is

219
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,679
the growers who want to go to the

220
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,829
dispensary right because I'm a grower

221
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:51,919
myself so if I didn't want to smoke my

222
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,330
own products then I can wouldn't be able

223
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,099
to sit down and talk to you I had a

224
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,900
higher man-to-man right because I

225
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,750
believe in what I do and I believe in

226
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:01,819
what I produce right since so your

227
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:05,110
market is kind of that connoisseur

228
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,110
market so way

229
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:11,339
what cultivars are you cultivating and

230
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,250
are you like chasing pipe strains are

231
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,560
you like

232
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,340
this is what I love to smoke I'm gonna

233
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,879
grow

234
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:20,620
you know and honestly it's it's a

235
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,778
combination everything right and that's

236
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,610
one thing that I'm thankful you know a

237
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:26,259
highlight Farms we're always pushing

238
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,778
right we usually pop about a hundred

239
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:30,340
seeds a month if not more so we're

240
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:32,139
always hunting new genetics and we're

241
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,820
always pushing the limits and and we

242
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:35,379
reach out to we have a good relationship

243
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,028
with a lot of readers like relentless

244
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:40,000
genetics raw genetics right these are

245
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:41,470
guys we test for so we're able to to get

246
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,809
our hands on genetics before other

247
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,370
people do we want to create the hype we

248
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:48,009
don't want to chase the hype right and

249
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,720
now while there is quality out there we

250
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:51,639
want strains that last the test of time

251
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,320
I'll give you a great example right

252
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,789
purple punch is a phenomenal strain

253
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,520
right we all know and love it

254
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:59,500
it's a beautiful strain looks like it's

255
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,539
the most potent strain of all time and

256
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,370
when you're growing it has the most

257
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:05,919
insane smells of all time you're like oh

258
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,860
my god this is the mecca of weed right

259
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:11,349
no once you smoke it you find that it's

260
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,230
those long stalk trichomes that give it

261
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,450
that crazy coated appearance right but

262
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,550
all the oil and the potency is up in the

263
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,410
in the head of the trichome right so

264
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:22,899
it's not that it's more potent it

265
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:24,219
usually tests anywhere from 19 to 25

266
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:28,179
percent at least in my experience

267
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,830
growing it right so it's it's one of

268
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:34,289
those very deceiving pictures and in

269
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,290
this Instagram kind of

270
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,009
generation that we're in right

271
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,500
everything's about visuals and not so

272
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:44,039
much about terpenes and again a lot of

273
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,879
that old-school but right like CEM do G

274
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,219
Lemon G right

275
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:50,200
these are strains from back in the day

276
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,940
Northern Lights right they are not the

277
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,129
most visually appealing but when you

278
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,900
smell them your mouth absolutely

279
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:57,399
salivates because they're overloaded

280
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:00,610
with terpenes right and that's kind of

281
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,679
like a lost thing so we try to have a

282
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,860
lot of classics like triangle cush og

283
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:09,839
cush chem dog right like the actual chem

284
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:12,340
dog GDP things like that but we also

285
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,500
again we'll go for newer stuff like dos

286
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,330
Eidos right is a classic we do grow

287
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,340
purple punch I feel like purple punch is

288
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,930
great beginner we it right we also grow

289
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,180
the classic blue dream we have a nice

290
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:24,069
santa cruz cut you know i know that's

291
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:25,599
one that everybody likes to hate on but

292
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,910
at the same time it's also the number

293
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,100
one selling strain in the industry just

294
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:31,509
because people coming into it that's

295
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,269
what they hear so that's I guess what

296
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:36,039
they're going to gravitate towards right

297
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:38,230
so you have to play the market as well

298
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:40,059
right like so while we're able to have

299
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,279
fun we still want to appeal to everybody

300
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:43,689
we don't just want to we grow a lot of

301
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:45,699
heavy indicas because that's what we

302
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:49,270
like to smoke right you know rocket fuel

303
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:51,860
Junior Mints a lot of archive gear you

304
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:53,409
know so popular og

305
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,539
[Music]

306
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:59,409
they're cultivators as the equivalent of

307
00:11:55,539 --> 00:12:02,078
like a very accomplished musician who's

308
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:05,049
told to go play apartments and like

309
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:07,088
place of like but you know top 40 music

310
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:08,708
you're like but I could play amazing

311
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:12,220
jazz music and they're like yeah they

312
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:14,588
don't want yet they want high THC they

313
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,639
want the popular strains they want the

314
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:20,430
Instagram strange so you have to balance

315
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,828
if the market wants what you truly love

316
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:25,469
to be like I wish you all appreciated

317
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:27,509
this right but absolutely and well and

318
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,339
that's another problem I have right is

319
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:31,319
people want to blame this industry or

320
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,240
blame the market right why don't we take

321
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,230
responsibility that's my responsibility

322
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,870
to educate people right as a grower as

323
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,610
as someone in this industry to educate

324
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,740
them on hey it's not just about looks

325
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,230
it's about smell it's about flavor it's

326
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,269
about effect right all that matters show

327
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,278
you don't get to corner those people in

328
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:52,679
the dispensary so now you're relying on

329
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:54,509
the bystander no but again this is where

330
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,250
technology is a beautiful thing they can

331
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:58,588
reach out to me through Instagram right

332
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,600
and I'm able to educate that way or and

333
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:03,269
and I try to stay very open to people

334
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,980
and always very educational because I'm

335
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:06,690
never here to hide anything I do because

336
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,550
I'm always evolving right so if I teach

337
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,680
you something this year next year it's

338
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:12,299
gonna be different because I figured out

339
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,159
a new technique I figured out a new

340
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,469
strain right so I'm not scared to share

341
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,809
kind of anything like that you know what

342
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,570
I mean certain things like business-wise

343
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:23,369
you're not really able to say that's one

344
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,199
thing right that's a business aspect but

345
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,850
as far as it grow you can come to where

346
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:28,740
our facility will show you what we got

347
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,089
going on right and we're very open and

348
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,310
honest about it because we have nothing

349
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:37,030
to hide and we believe in what we do so

350
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:39,969
you said your

351
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:42,039
so what are you copying and what are you

352
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,680
destroying on what's making your eyes

353
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:46,480
light up we just got done running a lot

354
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:48,250
of the archive gear he just dropped a

355
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,370
lot of new moon boat crosses so what

356
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:53,409
moonbow is is it's a dosey doe stein

357
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,419
Skittles male that he took right knee he

358
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:57,519
crossed it to a lot of his classic

359
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:59,889
strains so like Hollywood pure cush

360
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,899
right and that's called a flavor pack

361
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:03,819
right and so we just ran through we

362
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:07,000
normally pop around 50 seeds of each

363
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,440
strain just that they say around a 5%

364
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,809
margin and you can find the specific

365
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,550
Fino the breeder wants you to find so

366
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:14,500
they say about 50 seeds it's a minimum

367
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:16,719
you can pop for that at least that's

368
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,899
kind of some people schools of thought

369
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,550
right so that's kind of the theory we

370
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:23,470
fall under so we usually go for about

371
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:25,539
four packs per strain is what we pop

372
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,180
right so out of there we usually end up

373
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:30,639
a 50/50 is on average of what you'll

374
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:33,339
find between male-female right so we're

375
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,399
looking at around 25 females so a good

376
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:40,180
selection right and just really really

377
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,529
unique terpene profiles that are kind of

378
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:45,849
pushing the boundaries of something

379
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:49,120
different you know like just like Rosie

380
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,950
gassy kind of just almost a full

381
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,440
spectrum right like it's very

382
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:56,259
interesting in a palette if you will

383
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,940
like it it paints like a rainbow of your

384
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:00,309
senses when you smell it it's very

385
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,810
unique and interesting you know another

386
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:04,088
one we're about to finish up and take

387
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:06,729
down from him as rainbow driver so

388
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:09,610
that's Sunday driver from can Toronto

389
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,460
genetics times skittles and you get a

390
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,950
lot of again like rainbow fruits right

391
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:18,970
it's melon its

392
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:21,640
it's oranges it's limes right like it's

393
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,620
not just one it's strawberry it's it's a

394
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,980
whole kind of wave of flavors and it's

395
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,539
just very it's different on the senses

396
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,310
right you're used to smelling like okay

397
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:32,319
this strain smells like lemons but then

398
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:33,849
when you get like it's kind of like it

399
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,550
brushes by you almost like you're like

400
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,320
driving by it like like a fruit stand

401
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:41,039
right you know and you just get all the

402
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,270
flavors at once it's very unique

403
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,969
relentless just sent us a lot of his new

404
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:48,100
rosette crosses so we're popping some

405
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,649
gelato stuff and then we brought back a

406
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,930
classic head banger from karma genetics

407
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:55,480
we popped right and that's a biker cush

408
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:57,459
and Sour Diesel and I think that's one

409
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,399
thing that has kind of been lost is like

410
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,509
a really good sour and I feel like

411
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,459
Karma's doing a very good job of

412
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:06,549
bringing that back in seed form you know

413
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,860
I grew a Jays cut a Sour Diesel for a

414
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:11,199
long time and if you've taken any

415
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,509
shorter than 11 12 weeks I mean the

416
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,220
terpene profiles not there right and in

417
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:18,700
a lot of these commercial Gardens that's

418
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,200
just not feasible you know so we're

419
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,810
lucky to run on a nine week schedule

420
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,580
right so most of the no majority of

421
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:27,579
everything we grow finishes in that time

422
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,290
and fades out nicely but those kind of

423
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,139
longer running binos seem to take a

424
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:33,549
little bit longer and he's managed to

425
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:35,529
shorten that flowering time but still

426
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:38,469
get those great sours and cush is

427
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,730
brought out of that you know so those

428
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,379
are some of the genetics we're really

429
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,110
looking forward to you know

430
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:46,450
you know plastics like dosey doe is one

431
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,490
of my favorites kanan rattle pucker

432
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,460
which is lemon G times triangle push

433
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:54,250
it's like very bright lemons and then

434
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:58,269
like a dark diesel that finishes it's

435
00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:00,129
almost acidic if you will so very

436
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:02,340
devastating but great for daytime as

437
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:02,340
well

438
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:10,269
[Music]

439
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,140
Duns your methodology Overland

440
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:13,139
the past five years

441
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:19,359
to express itself from it

442
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:25,509
and that's the thing is every time you

443
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,189
you know every time I grow these strains

444
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:29,740
I learned something new right so it's

445
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:31,600
always very humbling and that's the term

446
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,099
master grower is always very hard for me

447
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,678
to comprehend because I don't believe

448
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:38,019
we'll ever master it but what we learn

449
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,460
is is the one thing I noticed is when

450
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:41,200
you bring in new genetics not

451
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,900
necessarily popping seeds right but when

452
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,569
you bring in new genetics from someone

453
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,038
else there's a rule of three in my

454
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:49,839
opinion like I have to cycle through

455
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:51,429
that strain I have to flower it three

456
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,798
different times for it to acclimate to

457
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:55,899
me right and for me to see its potential

458
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:57,879
like just like when you get a new house

459
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:59,349
right you don't have your routine set up

460
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,850
right it usually takes you about six

461
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:03,009
months before you kind of in your groove

462
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:04,869
you know same with these genetics right

463
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:07,028
these are living breathing things like

464
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:08,349
so they operate the same way and they

465
00:18:07,028 --> 00:18:10,419
can get stress and they have to learn

466
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:14,259
your feed schedule your style of growing

467
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:15,820
and acclimate to you so you know I

468
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,980
believe it's about a rule of three for

469
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:20,048
that to dial in but then again like a

470
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,298
great example right is we're starting to

471
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:25,089
experiment with different pops so we

472
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:27,369
always ran royal gold with three gallon

473
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:28,959
pots right and then we're like okay why

474
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:31,389
don't we try to gallon pots and we can

475
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,360
get away with less water and we found we

476
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:36,610
got bigger plants right we're like this

477
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:38,408
is mind blowing right and so we're like

478
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:39,939
why don't we try one gallon pot so we

479
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:42,070
tried the chart quarters right and no

480
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,230
transplanting and saving it a crazy

481
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:47,589
amount of time you know and labor so

482
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:50,548
huge cost savings right there and we

483
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:53,730
found we're getting just as big a plan

484
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:56,250
but what we see though in these

485
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,528
different mediums is we see different

486
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:01,798
phenotypic expressions gorilla glue for

487
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:06,778
example right like I'll get a great mix

488
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:08,579
of soured of and chem sis and chocolate

489
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:11,460
diesel when I grow it in the Royal gold

490
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:15,058
but I'm noticing now in my first trial

491
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:17,220
of flora Flex pots with cocoa I'm

492
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:19,648
getting a lot more of the chemists kind

493
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,169
of phenotypic expressions you know and

494
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:25,558
so it's just very unique it almost looks

495
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:27,240
like a different cut of gorilla glue you

496
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:30,269
know what I mean so but it's the exact

497
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,690
same cut and it's just very interesting

498
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:37,349
how in the same rooms but just changing

499
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,950
the home for the roots right changes the

500
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:39,719
plant

501
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,470
you know so just these little tweaks I'm

502
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,819
noticing all this stuff adds up right so

503
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:47,190
you know I think Adam doesn't put it

504
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:48,898
best he looks at growing is kind of like

505
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,360
a report card right and you start

506
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:53,609
everybody starts in school with an A and

507
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,369
then you miss one homework assignment

508
00:19:53,609 --> 00:20:00,629
right you miss one water okay down

509
00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:02,489
you're in an a - you the lights

510
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:05,460
accidentally stayed on for 15 minutes

511
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,960
extra right okay now you're at an A you

512
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,899
know what I mean so all these little

513
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,389
stresses start to add up and then you

514
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:15,869
lose the true genetic potential of these

515
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:18,808
plants but the less we stress them and

516
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:21,329
the better we get them we get them from

517
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:23,730
clone to harvest we see the true

518
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:26,189
potential right because all that stress

519
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,349
while we may not think oh it came back

520
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,720
okay a couple days later that couple

521
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:32,548
days was huge you know what I mean so

522
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,538
you're losing a lot when you're trying

523
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:35,538
to time these players

524
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:41,600
transfer plants I think there's good

525
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:43,069
stress and there's bad stress right so

526
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,079
like pruning is an example of good

527
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:47,809
stress or topping is an example of good

528
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:49,879
stress right but like letting your

529
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:53,119
plants will till they almost die or

530
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,560
light stressing your plants or wind

531
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,319
stressing your plants I don't think

532
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:01,220
necessarily is the best thing right you

533
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:03,710
know I think like you know manipulations

534
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,690
like pinching pruning low stress

535
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:10,549
training things like that right are

536
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:12,019
beneficial and low wind stress but again

537
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:13,460
there's beneficial stress and then

538
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:15,019
there's unbeneficial stress so it's

539
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,490
knowing the difference between the two

540
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:18,490
and when to apply them

541
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,740
you're experiencing all sorts of

542
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:30,899
stresses and pressures terpenes are kind

543
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,420
of how the cannabis plant protects

544
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:37,980
itself like it can sense what's come in

545
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:40,500
but it will again exude terpenes

546
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,650
deal with whatever the issue is and so

547
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,650
you're

548
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:47,769
it's her pain expression it's almost you

549
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,360
want that plan to endure different

550
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:51,339
stresses and that kind of just be like a

551
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,379
host plane where everything's perfect

552
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:55,480
and it never has to suffer

553
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,250
you know absolutely and again it's just

554
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,140
going back to those good stress versus

555
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,288
the bad stress right and knowing when to

556
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,910
implement it you know I think if you're

557
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:05,859
trying to snap a bunch of tops at week

558
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,509
six that's probably not the right kind

559
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:11,109
of stress you want to apply to plants

560
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:12,990
and things like that right I guess like

561
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:15,759
what what are your theory is that sense

562
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:18,370
on this subject right what what how do

563
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:22,509
you feel about that well that's why I

564
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:25,379
kind of love your cultivation because I

565
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:27,569
feel like you know

566
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,310
even though you can play God and a

567
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:29,990
totally

568
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:32,869
a fireman

569
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,039
is that really allowing the plant to be

570
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:38,250
kind of

571
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,559
like you never think a coggle of kid is

572
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,390
gonna turn out it's exactly the best

573
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,759
people you know have had a fucked up

574
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,900
life you know what I mean and those are

575
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:55,980
your favorite people because they've

576
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:57,540
been tested they have carried your

577
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,829
you're in the middle of growing the

578
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,629
greenhouse we could probably say it's an

579
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:05,220
example to some stuff you've done the

580
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:08,140
past like same strains in the

581
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,670
are you noticing differences like you're

582
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,200
like these are the same genetics we're

583
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:14,259
growing up right next door to each other

584
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,410
but I'm noticing a difference absolutely

585
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:19,599
you'll notice you know they'll revert

586
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,970
back to seed vigor you can take a Dutton

587
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,369
plant from Indore and put it out into

588
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,500
the Sun and reinvigorate it right and

589
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:28,539
it's like why can we do that that says

590
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,640
something right there that yes you'd

591
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:32,079
like you saying indoor you are not

592
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,670
getting the true potential of these

593
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,169
genetics there's something about the

594
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,060
power of the summit we're not able to

595
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:39,519
mimic and it's I don't know if it's all

596
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:41,440
the UVs or exactly what it is I'm not

597
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,389
very educated as far as that goes so I

598
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,029
couldn't explain that right what I do

599
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,470
see that these plants do perform

600
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:48,910
differently and they perform better

601
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,890
right this is their home and that's

602
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:53,320
what's got me excited about greenhouse

603
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,300
production is because I'm able to dial

604
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:57,609
in the environment but harness the power

605
00:23:55,299 --> 00:24:00,460
of the Sun so that we can get the best

606
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:02,439
about worlds right and that's what I

607
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:06,940
truly believe we'll be able to see the

608
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:12,849
full potential what's your opinion

609
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:15,639
yeah and I agree I mean I I front from a

610
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:16,569
variety of standpoints I'm not a big fan

611
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:18,758
of Indore

612
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:22,119
I think from starting with like the

613
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:25,389
environment like in California you have

614
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:27,339
all these desert roads you have all

615
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:30,418
these it's a hundred and ten degrees

616
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:33,730
outside and your

617
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:37,759
an indoor facility when it

618
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:40,339
HPS lights right and

619
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,819
meanwhile there like LA County is a good

620
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:44,889
example

621
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:44,889
LA County is 40%

622
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:51,079
grows amazing fruits and vegetables yet

623
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:53,740
that ordnance is that

624
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:56,589
grow out of doors now

625
00:24:53,740 --> 00:25:00,319
you have to grow indoor in a very small

626
00:24:56,589 --> 00:25:01,859
commercial area in the entire county

627
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,439
and so

628
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:08,849
the policy is pushing towards indoor but

629
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,798
I think moms like long-term when you can

630
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:13,980
sell cross-border and I'm not just

631
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,670
saying from Michigan to Illinois but

632
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,490
like

633
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:19,620
from anywhere to anywhere in the world

634
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:23,099
right what are you gonna see are you're

635
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:25,169
gonna see as many indoor growth like no

636
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:26,969
absolutely not because it's again it

637
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,830
goes back to that chasing that cost per

638
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,779
pound and getting that down always right

639
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:32,909
and being as efficient as possible and

640
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:34,529
when you can harness the energy of the

641
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,550
Sun without having to pay these enormous

642
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:37,259
electric bills

643
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:40,409
how could you compete against that right

644
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:43,920
you can so that is the evolution and I

645
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:46,080
agreed and I think it's just you know

646
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,600
it's just an ignorance on a lot of

647
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,579
people's hearts and a lot of

648
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:53,579
misunderstanding as far as is what this

649
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:55,379
plant can provide for us and for the

650
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:57,389
economy as well right and I think the

651
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,480
more people get educated the more they

652
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:03,390
understand you know those laws that

653
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:05,849
people will be more open-minded to okay

654
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:08,670
we can have green houses right it's not

655
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:11,219
a big deal if a school bus drives by a

656
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:13,259
cannabis grow it's gonna be okay

657
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,829
you know what I mean like it's not the

658
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:18,839
end of the world what are some lessons

659
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:23,038
you've learned

660
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:26,490
like fatty pests and pathogens so like

661
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,450
as you scale indoor right like powdery

662
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:31,420
mildew

663
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:34,450
you get thrips you get spider mites like

664
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:36,370
what happens lessons you've learned over

665
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:39,549
years of doing this

666
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:41,919
allows you to produce this is your

667
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:45,970
proactive versus reactive so what are

668
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:49,279
you doing it kind of

669
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:52,819
reduce the possibility of hole

670
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:55,869
I think it comes down to a good IPM you

671
00:26:52,819 --> 00:27:00,710
know and have a good understanding of

672
00:26:55,869 --> 00:27:02,179
environments you know people I taper my

673
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,190
environment like people that will taper

674
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,960
a feed schedule as well right so every

675
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:08,690
week it's going to vary a little bit you

676
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,400
know until the yet right and so as

677
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,259
having an understanding of that having

678
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,450
an understanding of your gross style and

679
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:16,309
how to properly prune your plants so you

680
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,110
don't get microclimates right

681
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:20,389
those are huge factors especially on a

682
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:23,000
large scale facility having the proper

683
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,980
sprayers to know that when your guys are

684
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,779
spraying they're actually covering every

685
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,160
inch of the leaf surface because once

686
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:33,889
you leave one spot open

687
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:35,330
that's how pests build you know what's

688
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,030
the word I'm looking for resistance

689
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:40,639
right things like that and just having a

690
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:42,319
good understanding and the proper setup

691
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,240
right a lot of people want to try to do

692
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:48,889
it cheaply you cannot grow cannabis

693
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:52,190
cheaply right like it's it's profitable

694
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:54,530
but it's not to grow good cannabis it's

695
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,570
not cheap right so it while it is

696
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:59,509
profitable it does take a large upfront

697
00:27:56,569 --> 00:28:02,799
cost right you need heavy amounts of air

698
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:06,619
conditioning you need age HVAC as far as

699
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:08,809
excuse me a humidity humidification and

700
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:11,779
dehumidification right you need

701
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:13,639
environment a wind movement rolling

702
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:16,399
tables irrigation things like this and

703
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,780
how you going to water and understanding

704
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:22,670
all that plays a big part in it

705
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:23,569
you are implying before that you do full

706
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:26,340
ears

707
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:28,500
yes sir yeah what so when are you

708
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:29,490
putting into this friend like what do

709
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,679
you what do you also will do a

710
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,890
biological spray so if anything it'll be

711
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:38,130
like a serenade product right you know

712
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:40,919
again because we use biologicals for to

713
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:43,320
combat any kind of like pest pressure

714
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,240
you know and so that's how we're able to

715
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:46,798
stay without spider mites without having

716
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,019
Russell mites without threats without

717
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,308
Ruud aphids anything like that and our

718
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,918
plants are able to stay happy and

719
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:56,220
healthy and how frequently are you

720
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:58,500
spraying we're in veg will spray every

721
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:03,259
three days will spray with a biological

722
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:05,460
or will spray a beneficial like a

723
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:07,619
beneficial like a nutrient spray if you

724
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,600
will right like we'll make seaweed in

725
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:11,278
silica right you know just to kind of

726
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,349
help strengthen up cell walls of the

727
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,450
plants and that way if some reason my

728
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:17,308
pests don't catch it the silica is so

729
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,110
thick on the plants that the bugs can't

730
00:29:17,308 --> 00:29:20,700
even bite into it right you know I'm

731
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:22,379
just kind of understanding that balance

732
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,048
again also understanding how to prune

733
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,059
properly alright like and making sure

734
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:29,548
like you remove as many families as

735
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:31,528
possible to not have those microclimates

736
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:34,230
but without over stressing your plants

737
00:29:31,528 --> 00:29:35,970
you know so just having that balance but

738
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,339
again having a good having a good

739
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,110
sprayer and having a good IPM schedule

740
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:41,759
and understanding how to rotate so you

741
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:44,579
use like an atomizer

742
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:48,180
like kindness exactly exactly what do

743
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:51,720
you use I get DRAM or like it's almost

744
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,880
like a car a paint sprayer where you

745
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,509
know and it's like a handgun and then we

746
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,670
have a big reservoir but the beautiful

747
00:29:56,509 --> 00:30:01,769
no no no like a cart yeah exactly cuz

748
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:03,330
the hose so you know you imagine trying

749
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:06,029
to walk down an aisle with a backpack

750
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:07,769
with trellis up and then turn around

751
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:09,480
you're gonna get caught up in it

752
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:11,039
you know I can't ask my guys to be

753
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,410
efficient in that kind of environment

754
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,089
right so it's also creating success for

755
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:21,540
your people to implement what you ask

756
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:23,909
them to do and again absolutely we use a

757
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:27,329
lot of beneficials you know so we'll do

758
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:29,940
like og bio war mix with earthworm

759
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:32,309
castings and stuff like that and then a

760
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,690
little bit of kelp of molasses right you

761
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:36,000
know and things like that will brew

762
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:38,940
those up will use like the Opilio bio

763
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,579
the tribus or recharge you know those

764
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:44,759
are great products that we like but yeah

765
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:46,649
so once we move over to flour though we

766
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:49,079
stopped spraying you know so that's

767
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:51,240
where we kind of differentiate ourselves

768
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:53,549
as far as commercial growers as we try

769
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,849
not to just spray the plants just to

770
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:58,829
allow them you know I feel like you know

771
00:30:56,849 --> 00:31:02,969
trichomes are so sensitive and any kind

772
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:04,679
of damage you apply to them it's it has

773
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:06,390
a long-term effect right you know I've

774
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,610
seen great product that's been sprayed

775
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,110
but you know the less you can spray it

776
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:11,459
the better it is right just like the

777
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:13,538
less you stress it the better it comes

778
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,100
out you know so again

779
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,408
we always aim for is trying for the

780
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:21,038
highest quality so once we move over to

781
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:22,720
flower our environments you know we just

782
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,729
believe in our environmental control and

783
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,269
then we let the beneficial bugs take

784
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:30,370
over have you ever personally made like

785
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:33,410
bubble hash

786
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:37,549
we have an extraction department that

787
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:40,100
does yes sir but you personally out of

788
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:45,019
like home flour but never like yes sir

789
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:46,759
yeah wait wait flour have you grown do

790
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:49,329
you think that lends itself to making

791
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:49,329
the best pack

792
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:56,529
for home use

793
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:57,099
in terms of yield or flavor who you're

794
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:58,930
looking for

795
00:31:57,099 --> 00:32:02,079
what are you looking for when you make

796
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:07,360
your own personal use what are you

797
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:10,629
looking for to try cons well I think

798
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:13,269
like you know there's different textures

799
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:15,790
of oils right like an OG Kush is gonna

800
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:18,009
give you a very like sappy oily kind of

801
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:19,269
right and then a chem D is gonna be a

802
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:21,700
little bit gritty ER and then a

803
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:23,500
strawberry guava like it has a more

804
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,380
sandy trek home so you're gonna get like

805
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:29,740
a drier kind of a sift right you know

806
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,270
and and so it just really depends on

807
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,539
what kind of mood I'm in because it's

808
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:37,119
always changing you know so you know one

809
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:39,700
cycle I'll grow some oh geez right and

810
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:41,439
I'll be very into that wet oil right and

811
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,730
then the next round I'm like I'm one a

812
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,070
little bit of fruit right so I'll switch

813
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,960
it up and then I usually find you get

814
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:49,389
this this kind of sandy or not always

815
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,920
right but you know the sandy you're kind

816
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:55,509
of trichome heads from that kind of

817
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:57,940
stuff but right now it's very much into

818
00:32:55,509 --> 00:33:00,129
the like that just like that wet live

819
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:03,670
resin you know and just like with the

820
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:05,950
Terps and everything it's very beautiful

821
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:08,590
almost like that apple sauce texture you

822
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,160
know and you got to like stir it up back

823
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:12,589
in your home

824
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,050
Colorado who is crushing like could he

825
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:16,759
disrespect as a cultivator or an

826
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:19,879
extractor

827
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:22,429
oh man there's in Colorado quite a few

828
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,919
people the herbal cure always you know

829
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:26,509
they gave me my first opportunity and

830
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,830
they gave me a place to call home you

831
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:29,720
know so I'm always thankful for them

832
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:31,490
because you know without that

833
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,169
opportunity I wouldn't be able to be

834
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:35,089
here today talking to you you know and I

835
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:37,160
wouldn't have met you know my good

836
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:39,649
friend Ben who gave me the opportunity

837
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,860
to come here so of course first and

838
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:45,110
foremost them I believe 710 labs as far

839
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:47,058
as commercial hash who's pushing

840
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:49,849
boundaries right Green Dot labs is

841
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:53,079
another one when it when is 710 labs

842
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:55,118
doing that you think is battery poison

843
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:57,189
like what do you notice in your life man

844
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:59,259
they run like no-till beds and their

845
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:01,840
flour right they're really just about

846
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:04,450
cultivating the best oils and they don't

847
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:05,769
even go for at least the way I heard it

848
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,360
right and I could be wrong I I don't

849
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:08,500
want to be misspoken because I have a

850
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,568
lot of respect for them

851
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,608
but I heard they kind of have some kind

852
00:34:10,568 --> 00:34:15,699
of system where they go for like oil

853
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:18,878
pearlite not necessarily like pounds for

854
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:20,259
life right and so just kind of they're

855
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:22,929
changing the game in that kind of

856
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,940
mindset and the way people think and I

857
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:26,260
always appreciate that because that's

858
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,329
breaking the mold and they're always

859
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:30,429
trying to educate and push boundaries

860
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:33,129
and you know when I look at people like

861
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:35,500
that it makes me feel like I suck right

862
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:38,108
and then that's the best feeling because

863
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:41,679
then I get fired up I'm motivated right

864
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:43,539
and so you know green dots another great

865
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,889
example he always has new genetics he's

866
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:47,619
always breeding something new when his

867
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:51,450
hashes phenomenal you know so he's

868
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:51,450
pushing a lot of boundaries you know so

869
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,539
you know I believe 710 is doing indoor

870
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,859
they also are in California as well I

871
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:05,079
don't know if they're doing any outdoor

872
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:06,579
and I'm not sure I know Green Dot has

873
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:10,000
indoor I'm not sure if they're doing any

874
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:11,440
outdoor for that well but I do know like

875
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,530
they also I believe like if your

876
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,720
products good enough they'll like

877
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:18,430
process for you right so I'm sure they

878
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,219
they might process for some outdoor

879
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:22,819
people

880
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:24,829
look at your trike ons

881
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,269
yes sir exactly and those are my

882
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:28,190
favorite kind of people right it looks

883
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:29,690
like I think you should be judgmental

884
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,980
when it comes to your weed right you

885
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,050
should be concerned about what you put

886
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,240
in your body like you don't have

887
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,350
something to filter this right it's

888
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,939
getting right directly into your

889
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:40,730
bloodstream so you should be a little

890
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,800
more mindful right like and it's helped

891
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,940
me be mindful in like my health in

892
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,769
general right because then it's like

893
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,750
okay well now I need to eat better right

894
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:49,369
like you know for the longest time I was

895
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,869
more concerned about making sure my

896
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:52,759
plants got all the nutrition while I

897
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:55,549
give was like eating Cheetos you know

898
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,370
and now now it's like it's helped

899
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:00,769
educate me right so it's like this back

900
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:02,480
and forth relationship of like how can I

901
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:07,269
get the best out of it and then through

902
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,269
that it gets the best out of me you know
