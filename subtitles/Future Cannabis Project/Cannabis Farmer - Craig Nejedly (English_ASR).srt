[Music]

2
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,679
we're based out of northern Humboldt and

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,859
with talking trees farms we do

4
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,899
cultivation kind of indoor/outdoor we're

5
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,570
in the East County East North County and

6
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,719
in South County so we're in a little bit

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,450
of different Appalachia and run five

8
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,488
different farms the smallest is probably

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,940
just only a little over 1500 square feet

10
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:44,099
and then we go up to about 34 thousand

11
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:46,109
square feet outdoor all outdoor well

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,950
outdoor and then like hoop houses for

13
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:52,439
light debt and the smallest ones are you

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,239
know obviously like our older farms that

15
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,849
when we were first start and so they're

16
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,009
a little bit more in the shade and it's

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,800
been interesting to find certain what

18
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:04,259
strains with work and and like talking

19
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:07,079
about climate and amount of Sun that you

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,240
get so it's it's always tricky to find

21
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:16,259
out what to grow where that's always a

22
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:18,329
learning process right and some things

23
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,728
won't need as much son and we'll finish

24
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:22,590
early and still produce great cannabis

25
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:23,909
and then some stuff if you're doing more

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,540
of the fuelie stuff they just want that

27
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,540
full Sun

28
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:37,259
okay well you won't be surprised that

29
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:40,408
blue dream and Green crack pretty much

30
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,379
grow good anywhere they thrive in the

31
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,790
shade they're just all around I mean

32
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:46,379
they get a bad rap but all around

33
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,409
they're great strains for what they can

34
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:50,728
do and where you can grow them and then

35
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,259
once you get into the full Sun I mean

36
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:54,329
you could pretty much grow anything in

37
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,099
full Sun although I will say you can

38
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,640
some strains like a little bit more

39
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:01,079
shade I think Girl Scout cookies for one

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,460
is one stream that likes a little bit

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:11,969
more shade not too much but but for the

42
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:13,289
most part things like a lot of Sun can't

43
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:21,479
say that I have a favorite strange

44
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:23,239
variety is the spice of life we do a

45
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,068
little bit of everything we've

46
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,920
transitioned mostly into raised beds

47
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:31,679
light depths and are getting away from

48
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,629
full season plants just to do the two

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,310
harvests I personally enjoy growing some

50
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,879
more smaller plants than trying to grow

51
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,500
the 12 foot tall plant you know it's

52
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,239
it's not where I'm interested in in

53
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,799
dealing with it's a hard to deal with 12

54
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,950
foot tall plants and if you lose that

55
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:50,579
plant you lose a lot of material so I

56
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:53,069
think we go with raised beds mostly and

57
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:56,189
do global amending we try not to use any

58
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:57,419
liquids I pretty much used three liquids

59
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:01,109
throughout the whole season which would

60
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:04,409
be earth juice catalyst molasses and a

61
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:06,090
finishing llama I'm a newer product

62
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,909
called crescendo other than that we just

63
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,060
all dry amendment in global amending our

64
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:13,590
soil which is great because you know I

65
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,729
don't want to be throwing away bottles

66
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,180
and bottles and we would be throwing

67
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:21,599
away lots of bottles if we were using

68
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,370
synthetics or any brand of nutrient

69
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,959
that's in a bottle catalyst is the

70
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,700
product actually it actually just got

71
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,079
pulled from the shelves last month I

72
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,369
mean it's from earth juice which is a

73
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:34,709
brand it's been around for over 20 years

74
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,689
so they've been in the agricultural

75
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,859
nutrient business for a long time and

76
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:40,489
catalyst that's been one of their

77
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,689
flagship products it's one of their only

78
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:46,009
to this point one of their only organic

79
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:49,408
products but it's just an enzyme

80
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:54,568
macronutrient just just boot plant

81
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:56,009
booster yeah yeah they had to change the

82
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,389
name they couldn't use the name cat I

83
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:58,889
was like really curious does it go or

84
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:02,158
was it not organic and they were

85
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:05,188
mislabelling it but the local store told

86
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:08,188
me it was because California a gruel's

87
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:09,810
are just kind of ridiculous so they

88
00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:12,180
can't they can't call it catalyst

89
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,900
because that's what it does so I have to

90
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:20,120
change the name to it with a X and add a

91
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,120
list or something we definitely bootys

92
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:27,658
our TVs are massive we brew like a

93
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:30,959
minimum 500 gallons at a time so we use

94
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:35,399
from four to eight massive tea bags at a

95
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,989
time I probably unique way of doing it I

96
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,279
don't like make small batch and then add

97
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:43,560
that tea into a reservoir

98
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:45,359
I just brew a massive batch that old ax

99
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,569
that'll handle that fifteen hundred

100
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:53,189
gallons that we feed at a time and so we

101
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:55,319
brew it overnight yeah maybe not even 24

102
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:57,449
hours sometimes you know it's hot I mean

103
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,579
some of my water tanks stay around 80

104
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:02,129
degrees the water so I think they're

105
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:03,800
brewing fast and if we left it out 24

106
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:05,939
hours we probably killing

107
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,978
microbiology cuz we're in full Sun and

108
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:11,038
where the tanks are so we do shorter

109
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:13,709
brews and sometimes we'll add in some

110
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,990
bat guano and accentuate the actual

111
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:17,699
compost tea and make it a feeding or

112
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,750
sometimes we'll just top dress and just

113
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,750
do straight compost teas

114
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:27,850
not yet that's a goal to make our own

115
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:30,649
worm castings in our own compost that

116
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,510
off all things in time got a one one

117
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:33,889
step at a time like I said earlier

118
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:36,110
varieties of spice to life so I don't

119
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:38,269
stick to one compost if I'm you Bruna

120
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,100
compost I'll buy three different types

121
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:41,740
of compost cuz I'm sure everyone's got

122
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,379
something good whether it's Malibu

123
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,449
baseline dr. earth I don't want to just

124
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:49,009
focus on one cuz if they had a product

125
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:51,680
issue that I'm you know dealing with

126
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,659
that so I use I spread things out you

127
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,009
know I give everybody a little bit at

128
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,870
the chance with with their different

129
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:59,689
composts everyone's got different style

130
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,240
of compost whether it's manures and or

131
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:04,310
plant-based so we use a variety of

132
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,480
compost we switched that out over the

133
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:11,829
season and then besides the compost in

134
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,970
the castings and that as in the calcium

135
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,829
the biggest thing I've been adding is

136
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,200
epson salts lately because we're all in

137
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:19,759
off-grid well water and once we get the

138
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,339
water tested we're know it's really hard

139
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,079
super high in calcium and so that's that

140
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:26,949
tends to lock out the phosphorus for the

141
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:29,359
calcium magnesium is not in balance so

142
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:32,149
we've been at an epson salts and we'll

143
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,680
just been really noticeable difference

144
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:35,060
in terms of occur through the buds

145
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,959
growing out and the phosphorus not

146
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,970
locking up but otherwise the only

147
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,459
difference in the step stages of the tea

148
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:47,000
brews is when we add guano's so if we're

149
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:50,389
in veg we'll add a like a 931 Guana to

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,939
that when we go to transition i'll go

151
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:55,430
with like a four four four and then I

152
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:59,660
have a second transition I'll split it

153
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:01,310
with a 4 4 4 and a 2 12 - 14 - so kind

154
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,740
of like you start slowly introduced - hi

155
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:08,540
Fras and then then I'll go to all - 14 -

156
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:12,500
particularly I like the rainbow grow pro

157
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:16,520
bloom and grow rainbow pro bloom and

158
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:21,009
grow nutrient mixes that we add into our

159
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:25,099
teas our biggest success with and is

160
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:26,899
with the global amending like we do we

161
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,080
don't actually feed at all while our

162
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:31,909
plants are vegging it's all in the soil

163
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,438
so we mix in a pretty hot mix we have to

164
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,689
let it sit for 10 days

165
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,099
and thankfully I'm not putting those

166
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:39,499
together as a company up there called

167
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:42,259
soil escape solutions that really makes

168
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:45,289
my life a lot easier because they're the

169
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:49,999
soil scientists they know that that

170
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:51,738
aspect of it more than I do and so that

171
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:53,360
has helped us a lot so we get their

172
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:55,308
global amendment which is you know what

173
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,569
I've done for years just throwing a

174
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:59,209
little bit of that a little bit of that

175
00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:01,759
but now it's like the equations are

176
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:03,559
there the proportions are right and so

177
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,439
that just sets us off on like I'm

178
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:08,119
awesome veg stage and so actually we

179
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:10,939
don't even feed until we get into the

180
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:13,489
second week of bloom Weill a top dresses

181
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:15,379
and start doing teas I pretty much

182
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:17,478
that's all I do is drive around and

183
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:22,158
check in and bring supplies and oversee

184
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:23,478
and and I don't do as much of the

185
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:25,848
touching of the plants and the

186
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:29,838
wateriness I might have done 15 years

187
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:33,259
ago oh man I finally got hit with the

188
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:37,759
rust it might this June so I'm dealing

189
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:40,430
with that prevention is always the best

190
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,680
is key you know and some we were on a

191
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:46,068
preventative program I mean we do a lot

192
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:47,679
of sulfur in veg we don't want to use

193
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:51,500
Sol for after the first week of flower

194
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:53,388
but right now I'm actually dealing with

195
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,970
and learning a lot about these Russert

196
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:57,379
mites they don't like into like plants

197
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,149
that are into flowering past like four

198
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:00,889
to five weeks the buds are too developed

199
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:02,809
they don't seem to attack that they're

200
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:06,470
like fresh growth fresh blood

201
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:09,588
development so if you if you can handle

202
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,170
it early in veg prevention is key sulfur

203
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:14,029
is probably the most organic effective

204
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:15,860
product against those kinds of pests and

205
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:19,850
then there's bio fungicides like

206
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:21,350
venerate grande evo grande and those are

207
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,600
all made by one company I can't think of

208
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,689
the name and they also make a product

209
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,790
called regalia which is more PM oriented

210
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:30,500
thing with PM is once you have it you

211
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:33,318
can't get rid of it so again prevention

212
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,299
is the key and regalia is that product

213
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:40,219
so we'll mix regalia and grande Evo are

214
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:41,659
compatible and we separately foliar and

215
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,360
I'm not a big foliar spray I don't I

216
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:45,548
don't foliar feed my plants

217
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,360
it's not really my technique at all but

218
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:51,639
for IPM pest prevention we run them

219
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,068
through like we run them through my pump

220
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,619
system so we're pumping a hundred

221
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:59,048
gallons of spray at a greenhouse at a

222
00:09:56,619 --> 00:10:01,899
time through froggit nozzles so we're

223
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:03,399
able to just do high-volume spraying and

224
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:06,068
at this point we're doing it like every

225
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,438
other day to get these little fuckers in

226
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:10,860
check got us hand spray but every aisle

227
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:14,048
of the greenhouse has its own hose and

228
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,730
so we use this for feeding and then we

229
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:17,769
also have a separate water system set up

230
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,739
for dripping because we mostly do drip

231
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:22,749
we only hand feed once a week and then

232
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:25,360
the other natural drip drip water drip

233
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:26,739
but we don't I don't combine those

234
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,230
systems because I don't want the feed

235
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:34,179
system clogging my drip lines so they're

236
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:36,308
separated and then we feed we run the

237
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:37,600
foliage through our feed system and so

238
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:39,999
there's a hose down every aisle another

239
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,028
greenhouse and so they just turn on the

240
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,290
pump the tanks there they're not

241
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:47,798
carrying around a pump sprayer I got a

242
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:50,649
backpack pump and it's pretty it's

243
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:53,259
really efficient it's like a little

244
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,818
nozzle they make I think DRAM might even

245
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:56,889
make them yeah they're really great you

246
00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:58,238
can get half gallon one gallon two

247
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,308
gallon and four gallon a minute

248
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:03,100
and it just dispersed this kind of like

249
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:04,600
a pump sprayer would and so we don't we

250
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,879
use the two gallon a minute I've tried

251
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,100
them all two gallon a minute is what we

252
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,798
like to use four gallon minute kind of

253
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,860
hammers the plants but the two gallon a

254
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:16,499
minute how many issues with piano at all

255
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,058
this year

256
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:20,798
spider mites very easy he's got to deal

257
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:23,019
with them right but these new mic see

258
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:25,448
fucking can't see until you know they're

259
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:27,668
a problem is like a lot of people are

260
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:29,289
having issues with them and I've been

261
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:33,220
lucky to not have to deal with them till

262
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:38,769
June that costs it's just a very added

263
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:40,298
expense and throwing organic prevention

264
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:42,610
at them and then the time that my

265
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:43,620
workers have to spend after nine o'clock

266
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,889
spring

267
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,789
plants never gets dull never gets boring

268
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:49,789
on the corner

269
00:11:51,269 --> 00:12:06,439
