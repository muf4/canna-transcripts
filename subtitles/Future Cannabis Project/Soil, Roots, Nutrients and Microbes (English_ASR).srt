00:00:09,628 --> 00:00:13,838
my name is Colin bellum the co-founder

3
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:16,089
and chief growth officer for mammoth

4
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,160
microbes our company develops liquid

5
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:20,109
organic microbial soil additives to act

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,660
as a catalyst to maximize plant nutrient

7
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:24,579
uptake to significantly increase plant

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,699
yield and nutrient use efficiency across

9
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:30,399
many crops I was attending to talk today

10
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:32,950
on maximizing a fertility program for

11
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,198
cannabis and it was just an amazing job

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,570
of dialing in the function of specific

13
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:39,128
nutrients across the growing cycle and I

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,689
think that's the critical part of

15
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:42,789
understanding how to grow a crop with

16
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:45,459
precision is understanding how the key

17
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:46,870
nutrients incorporate into the plants

18
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,628
and how the plants are using those and

19
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:51,578
this stock was very very well done about

20
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:53,229
understanding the timing of nutrients

21
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:56,399
and how they're incorporated into the

22
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:56,398
biomolecules for plants

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,379
you

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,689
I'll go real quickly into that number

25
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:13,030
one the the highest requirements the

26
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:16,928
cannabis has our four nitrogen calcium

27
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,670
magnesium iron and boron it has it needs

28
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:19,719
all of the nutrients like all plants but

29
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,670
those are the hot-button

30
00:01:19,718 --> 00:01:24,309
nutrients the other requirements are

31
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,899
very pedestrian most all potting media

32
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,509
that people produce cannabis in our

33
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:30,099
phosphorus deficient plants need

34
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:32,170
phosphorus early to grow a root system

35
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:33,759
and of course beneficial microbes can

36
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,409
help with phosphorus availability and

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,879
maintenance as well I didn't really

38
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:39,039
comment on microbes today because that

39
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,478
was not the topic of my talk but plants

40
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,789
need phosphorus really to grow that root

41
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,280
system out during veg I like a 1 to 1

42
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:46,750
ratio of nitrogen into potash when you

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,489
start to flower you want to drop your

44
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,859
nitrogen down and increase your potash

45
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:52,688
you know at that point and you kind of

46
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:54,159
do that through late bloom as well and

47
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:55,779
then it finished most people just flush

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,819
all the nutrients out for the last

49
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,090
couple of weeks so there's four distinct

50
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:02,500
phases of growth in cannabis and if

51
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,670
you're doing it correctly you fertilize

52
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,670
them all a bit differently

53
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,140
well cannabis has one of the highest

54
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:16,240
requirements for boron of any crop I've

55
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:18,099
ever worked with I also mentioned that

56
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,140
almost all mother plants are deficient

57
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,599
in magnesium growers don't put enough

58
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:24,369
magnesium on their mother plants and so

59
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,409
you often see marginal yellowing in the

60
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,360
older leaves of mother plants which is a

61
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:30,129
lack of chlorophyll which is caused just

62
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,660
by taking cuttings all the time you're

63
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:33,519
removing a lot of magnesium from the

64
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:34,840
plant as you harvest your cuttings or

65
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,280
your clones and therefore you need to

66
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:44,980
replace that magnesium with

67
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:47,170
fertilization here's the short version

68
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:48,939
of that cannabis is a pretty heavy

69
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:51,339
feeder but it's also very soluble salt

70
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:53,439
sensitive in a normal situation if my

71
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,450
fingers are plant roots the salt content

72
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,579
in the plant roots is higher than the

73
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:59,769
surrounding soil moisture so moisture go

74
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,080
is very easily into the roots by osmosis

75
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,730
the plant doesn't have to work because

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,860
water molecules are a little bit

77
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:08,289
kidney-shaped in their charged water

78
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,240
molecules stick together and so as water

79
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:12,129
goes in it goes up the plant and out the

80
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,439
leaves ultimately when you add too much

81
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:17,019
salt around the root zone that that

82
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:18,819
osmotic advantage is lost if you put

83
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,159
enough salt surround the roots moisture

84
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,469
is pulled out of the root cells back

85
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,689
into the soil by reverse osmosis and

86
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,489
that's how fertilizer burns and that's

87
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:29,530
why a plant with high soluble salts

88
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,930
looks wilted even though the media is

89
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,250
wet it is wilted because the plant can't

90
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,319
take in the moisture that's there

91
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,969
because of the salt differential so I

92
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,069
was just trying to explain in simple

93
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:41,319
terms physiologically how fertilizer

94
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,239
burns I have a great I have a question

95
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,310
that I'd like a Lindt opinion on and one

96
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,469
of those things is you know as growers

97
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,180
are evolving and trying to distinguish

98
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:50,590
themselves everyone needs to still get

99
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,700
that yield and maximize yield but

100
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,280
they're trying to maximize the quality

101
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:56,709
within their phenotypes as well and one

102
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,110
of the hypothesis we have is the the

103
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,920
deficiency of micronutrients to enhance

104
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:05,080
the plant's ability to incorporate those

105
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,149
those molecules and maximize cannabinoid

106
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,290
and terpene profiles do you feel like

107
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,500
that's true and the growers that you've

108
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:13,479
seen where micronutrients might be under

109
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,970
undervalued in their nutrient program

110
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:20,500
sometimes yes : also for organic growers

111
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,180
getting good quality available microbes

112
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,959
can be a little bit problematic for the

113
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,019
organic

114
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,359
growing but I mean sure you know you've

115
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:30,459
seen the the barrel thing probably in

116
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,650
your first week in in college where you

117
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:35,228
know we need more protein than we need

118
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:37,418
vitamin b12 as humans but we need them

119
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:39,038
both equally and plants only need about

120
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:40,209
five parts for me and copper but they

121
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:41,709
need copper just as much as they need

122
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:43,719
nitrogen and phosphorus and everything

123
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:45,668
else right and the main things that

124
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,340
micronutrients do in plants is they

125
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:50,379
drive enzymatic chemical reactions in

126
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:55,629
the plant to make things like terpenes

127
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:57,819
and cannabinoids or you know you can't

128
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,769
neglect those so although the macro

129
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:02,139
elements incorporate and make these

130
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:05,049
proteins or enzymes which do all the

131
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:07,360
work there's cofactors that actually

132
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,009
incorporate into these proteins or these

133
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,810
enzymes to allow them to function and

134
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:16,629
those are typically in the form of trace

135
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:19,149
nutrients not exactly iron is another

136
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:21,279
one is iron important for cannabis oh

137
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:23,529
yeah it's one of the ones that has the

138
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,138
highest requirement for there is no iron

139
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:28,059
in chlorophyll but plants need iron to

140
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:29,978
make chlorophyll which is why when they

141
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,319
become deficient you lose chlorophyll in

142
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:34,839
the new foliage iron is also involved in

143
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,598
a lot of respiration and energy type

144
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:39,369
processes which is why when you often

145
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:41,348
see a plant with iron deficiency you'll

146
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,788
see it kind of stunted as well it's not

147
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:44,740
only lacking in chlorophyll and the new

148
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:46,000
leaves but the the carbohydrate

149
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,639
management is not functioning

150
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,500
functioning optimally I have another

151
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,870
question what do you think the biggest

152
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,788
education gap for a Tillet fertility

153
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,918
program is in general for cannabis

154
00:05:54,788 --> 00:06:01,839
cultivators as as this industry

155
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:05,348
progresses hmm tough question Colin I

156
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:07,269
would say number one there used to be a

157
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:09,158
lot of Voodoo in this industry a lot of

158
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:10,478
eye of Newt and you know everybody's got

159
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:13,538
their own little secret you know

160
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,860
formulas and stuff and that's fine you

161
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:17,860
know I don't have any problem with that

162
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,169
but I think that's going away slowly and

163
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,759
being replaced by science and chemistry

164
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:24,218
and microbiology I think roads are

165
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,080
gradually growing they're becoming a

166
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,728
little more technical and a little more

167
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,069
knowledgeable in that area and sometimes

168
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:32,259
they blow me away with how much science

169
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:34,538
some of them really do know now

170
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,189
horticulture to me is an art as well as

171
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:37,839
a science that's right you know

172
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:40,300
I mean there's a scientific aspect to it

173
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:43,119
but sometimes it's just that greenthumb

174
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,500
feel thing and we do things that

175
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,329
cannabis responsible you don't always

176
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,149
know why right we just know that they

177
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:52,689
like it yep but I would say they're just

178
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:54,250
becoming more scientific and less artsy

179
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:56,439
craftsy if I can use that well I think

180
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,689
its inherent parsley with the history of

181
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:00,910
this crop where it has been in the gray

182
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:02,709
market so to speak and now we're able to

183
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,510
work with it more openly and we can

184
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:06,879
gather that science where in every other

185
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:09,370
crop we have pretty good agronomy

186
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,839
science around the fertility programs

187
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,730
corn all the way to tomatoes or

188
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:14,649
strawberries cannabis is quickly growing

189
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,259
even man with microbes we have a 65 acre

190
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:19,209
high CBD farm and several 5,000 square

191
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:21,039
foot greenhouses and all we do is a

192
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:23,859
Granada Cree search to understand plant

193
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,170
responses and is not only with yield but

194
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,850
root development terpene production can

195
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,439
a baloney production and everything we

196
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:33,240
can do just to maximize the phenotypic

197
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,240
potential across different strengths

198
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,519
so for us as microbiologists and I think

199
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,930
you know some of our team we can be

200
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,269
characterized as world thought leaders

201
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,129
in this area we're understanding and

202
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:51,729
we're trying to figure out how to stress

203
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:53,379
or instigate chemical signaling with the

204
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,150
microbes there's obviously a nutrient

205
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:57,370
use efficiency aspect that microbes

206
00:07:55,149 --> 00:08:00,370
provide where you can maximize nitrogen

207
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,129
or phosphorus or sulfur or potassium or

208
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,750
even micro nutrient uptake through

209
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:06,129
simple or pretty pretty standard

210
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,319
biogeochemical cycling

211
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:09,850
that's what microbes do in nature plants

212
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,449
interact with microbes in nature to

213
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:14,470
maximize plant nutrient use efficiency

214
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:17,949
maximizing availability of nutrients

215
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:20,440
microbes do several things but plants

216
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:23,229
are environmentally triggered and Lynn I

217
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:26,019
want you to key in on here if you can

218
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:28,210
initiate some chemical signaling where

219
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:31,569
microbes are trigging triggering a

220
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:33,279
chemical or a signal to allow plants to

221
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,779
say hey I need to respond to this and

222
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,730
they can respond to it through a

223
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:38,589
cannabinoid production or a terpene

224
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:41,320
production and we can actually engineer

225
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,030
that meaning that we can introduce that

226
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,190
particular chemical signal through a

227
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,289
microbial interaction you can train

228
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,380
plants not to do things that they're not

229
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:52,449
genetically capable of but to express

230
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:55,330
that gene to maximize that particular

231
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,250
trait how do you feel about that well I

232
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,780
would say two things number one for

233
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,879
years we couldn't do research on

234
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:02,649
cannabis legally yeah now that's all

235
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,389
pretty well out the window and we can do

236
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:06,850
the type of research that you and others

237
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:08,620
are conducting right number two nobody

238
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,659
knows this I'm sure you do Colin but the

239
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,360
average tablespoon of healthy field soil

240
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:15,129
contains four billion microorganisms

241
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,350
about one percent of the dry weight of

242
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:19,450
that soil if I cut my hands like this

243
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,680
and hold soil I have more microbes in my

244
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,050
hand than there are people on this

245
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:24,969
planet that's how important microbes are

246
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:27,159
to plant production that's a good key

247
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,850
that you can use Rob in your in your

248
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:33,129
customer calling and you know soilless

249
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,470
media that we do with indoor growing is

250
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:38,379
often you know well deficient in

251
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,720
nutritional content so you know that

252
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:42,580
needs to be inoculated and you need

253
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,470
carbon sources to help maintain those

254
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,570
you know this better than me yeah but

255
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,129
yeah don't don't know you know to answer

256
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,910
your previous question what's the thing

257
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,789
that they're most

258
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:53,199
not familiar with soil microbiology is a

259
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:54,490
big one one reason it's a very

260
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,620
complicated subject

261
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,990
you know it's deep you know what you're

262
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,399
getting into is deep in the pool yet in

263
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,870
terms of chemical signaling and

264
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,179
microbial interactions and all this

265
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,070
stuff it's a complicated field and it's

266
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:08,819
hard even for more technical growers to

267
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,820
understand yeah

268
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,210
I stated earlier boron has a higher or

269
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,730
Canada's has a higher boron requirement

270
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,530
just about any crop I know I said in my

271
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,060
talk that boron is involved in

272
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,250
translocation and utilization of

273
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:27,500
carbohydrates which is a fancy way of

274
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,629
saying boron helps the plant make sugars

275
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,539
and move them around and you need that

276
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:34,340
when you're come to forming butts plants

277
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:36,019
can grow perfectly well vegetatively

278
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,540
with not very much boron but by flower

279
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,879
time you better have the boron there the

280
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:42,679
problem of course is that boron toxicity

281
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:47,240
is the most common toxicity in

282
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:49,729
agriculture because in most plants if

283
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,399
you are 25 parts per million in the leaf

284
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:55,190
tissue or below you're deficient and if

285
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,319
you're above 75 or 100 you're toxic it's

286
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,810
only about a 50 to 75 part per million

287
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,170
window in the leaf tissue so the boron

288
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:05,599
requirement was very surprising to me I

289
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:07,399
would say that's probably the most I was

290
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,470
also when I started working with

291
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,199
cannabis a bit shocked at how soluble

292
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,550
salt sensitive it is in almost every

293
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,379
grower I've ever worked with at times

294
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:17,539
has gotten into soluble salt trouble

295
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:19,730
which is why I did this finger thing in

296
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:21,769
the talk today to explain to them what's

297
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,950
going on one cool trick if you have a

298
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:26,029
girl with high soluble salts sugar water

299
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,009
irrigate with about five pounds of sugar

300
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:30,169
per hundred gallons or some molasses

301
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:32,000
it's a carbon source that stimulates the

302
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:34,009
microbes to eat the fertilizer salts up

303
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,509
yeah and if growers do that oh hi Oh

304
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:38,389
State University came up with that I

305
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:40,100
didn't yeah okay but my experience with

306
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:42,169
it is if you drench with sugar water

307
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,149
you'll lower your salts by 50 percent in

308
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:45,799
about two weeks yep and that's because

309
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:47,360
of the microbial interactions you talk

310
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:49,759
about how the microbes interact with the

311
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,800
plant roots to reduce what growers

312
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,019
typically call the lockout where

313
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:56,779
nutrients might be unavailable but

314
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:59,210
microbes can actually cycle that balance

315
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:01,519
the rhizosphere or the root zone out so

316
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,139
roots can actually take up nutrients in

317
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,759
a healthy manner and not have to worry

318
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,319
about focusing below ground that can

319
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,990
focus on above ground because there's no

320
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:16,350
lockout or stalemate of nutrient uptake

321
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:18,659
in the root and rises here some people

322
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,759
some people swear by it and some people

323
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:25,409
say I think it depends on your growing

324
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:26,669
strategy in your strain you know I think

325
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:29,009
they're stressing the plan a little bit

326
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:31,169
nutritionally and trying to get you know

327
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:33,629
bitter terpene production and better CBD

328
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:36,029
production with the flush some say that

329
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:38,299
with ingestible zorse MOCA bowls that

330
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:40,649
you get a better flavor less harshness

331
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:43,819
but it you know it's not a universal

332
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:53,909
thing it is a point of contention and

333
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:55,320
you know yes and more so in cannabis

334
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:56,549
than any crop I've ever worked with

335
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,890
anywhere in the world I probably worked

336
00:12:56,549 --> 00:13:01,049
with a thousand crops you know doing

337
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:02,129
what I do is a diagnostic laboratory

338
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,479
you know when growers would get into

339
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:04,889
trouble they'd send me stuff just like

340
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,379
I'm sure they do to you cough yeah and

341
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,449
so just the genetics

342
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:11,909
we've been breeding cannabis for sixty

343
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,920
five hundred years on this planet okay

344
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:17,219
and so the genetic diversity in cannabis

345
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,870
is ridiculous and therefore yes you need

346
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,210
to grow you need to learn how to grow

347
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,560
your strain both with fertility inputs

348
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,080
and lighting and irrigation and

349
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,149
microbial inoculants and just the whole

350
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,240
thing and I'm a believer in Flushing but

351
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:31,889
not everybody is and I respect that I'd

352
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,710
you hear from growers that when you

353
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:36,059
flush you get a cleaner end product

354
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,370
meaning if you even look at the color of

355
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:41,429
the ash it's white instead of dark and

356
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,470
it's allocated or are associated with a

357
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:45,569
high salt or chemical buildup

358
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,580
that's not burning cleanly and so I

359
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,800
think about that as just diluting the

360
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,900
salts that are taken up by the plant I

361
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,579
don't understand it well enough most the

362
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,939
growers that I talk to at least the

363
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:58,350
synthetic growers do flush the organic

364
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,710
growers not so much I don't think that

365
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:03,180
there's a real a real need to do that in

366
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,850
organic systems just because of the

367
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:07,709
nature of the of the or of the nutrient

368
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,060
inputs and it's harder to flush when

369
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,740
you're going organic of course please

370
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:12,719
understand I'm not against organic

371
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,500
growing in any way shape or form it's

372
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,790
just different and so you know but if

373
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,220
you do it right you can grow a heck of a

374
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:21,059
crop so we were talking about you were

375
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,990
talking about

376
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:27,329
foliar nutrient applications and they're

377
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,529
very popular in many crops especially

378
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,030
nitrogen and my question was

379
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:32,069
specifically is

380
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:33,480
they're different uptake for different

381
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,640
nutrients when you try to do foliar

382
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,230
applications and I think your answer was

383
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,230
yes you want to go into that the answer

384
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:43,050
is yes absolutely the corn and wheat

385
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,450
research shows that urea nitrogen and

386
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:47,449
potassium 50% of that can be absorbed

387
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:50,009
within eight hours of application the

388
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,740
micronutrients are really slow it's it

389
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:54,389
takes like four days to get 8% of the

390
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,039
foliar iron into a leaf at least in

391
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:57,629
those crops yeah some plants don't

392
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,149
absorb foliar nutrients well at all

393
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:02,519
plants with thick heavy waxy leaves like

394
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:04,470
rhododendrons or privets you know just

395
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,049
don't absorb very mother just figs yeah

396
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:10,080
yeah a lot of those things but it plants

397
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:12,599
with thinner leaves with thinner

398
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,310
cuticles you know absorb nutrients very

399
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,720
well palm trees are terrible at it yeah

400
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:17,699
you know I live in the tropics and palm

401
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,920
trees just don't absorb foliar nutrition

402
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,470
but some plants like cannabis which has

403
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,990
a pretty thin delicate leaf are pretty

404
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,060
good absorbance but the ratio and the

405
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,529
speed of absorption varies quite a bit

406
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,759
with the nutrient I have a follow-up

407
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,649
question you made a really good point

408
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,389
that when you add a foliar application

409
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:36,329
the nutrients are only going to be

410
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:37,769
absorbed whenever the it's still wet

411
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,440
when the leaves are still wet once it's

412
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:43,799
dried right no more absorption can yuri

413
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,920
wet the leaves to take up more than

414
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,689
solute yeah in outdoor agriculture once

415
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,389
it dries there's no more absorption

416
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,130
until you get fog or Dew or a little bit

417
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:56,399
of rain forgot it and so they if Yuri

418
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:58,080
wet the leaf absorption resumed yep so

419
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,240
that residual will become soluble and be

420
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,480
able to take up be able to be taken out

421
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,580
by the leaves yes yeah I also don't

422
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,620
believe in applying real high amounts

423
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,810
really high rates of foliar nutrition

424
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,159
like to keep the rates lower like what

425
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:15,839
is there a range that you could give

426
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:17,639
just very generally in cannabis if the

427
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,590
conductivity of your nutritional spray

428
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,899
is above about 1.8 I'd be a little

429
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,370
uncomfortable the reason is the other if

430
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,039
you spray real high rates of foliar

431
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:28,259
nutrients the osmotic concentration in

432
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:30,149
the droplet is such that as the droplet

433
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:32,909
dries and the salts become more

434
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:34,980
concentrated in the droplet noise Chur

435
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,689
is pulled again by osmosis out of the

436
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,700
leaf into the drop yet and so you're

437
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,440
actually promoting transpiration instead

438
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,170
of absorption yeah and

439
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,769
so I'd rather apply lower rates more off

440
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,259
yeah

441
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,818
also the absorption isn't that terribly

442
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,730
efficient for most of the nutrients yes

443
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:53,429
the analogy I always use is if this

444
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:55,110
microphone is a Pepsi bottle and I'm

445
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,448
trying to catch Niagara Falls in the

446
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,459
Pepsi bottle if I double the size of

447
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:01,349
Niagara Falls what goes in my Pepsi

448
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:03,599
bottle is still the same amount because

449
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,909
the Pepsi bottle to me represents the

450
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,370
limited ability to get fuller nutrition

451
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:10,829
into a plant polio nutrition is real

452
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:13,139
efficient in correcting deficiencies

453
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:14,879
whatever the plant isn't getting it's

454
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,069
real easy and efficient and

455
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,480
cost-effective to just put some foliar

456
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:26,519
on there I'm a big believer in foliar

457
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:28,890
nutrition in Moe in many plants it goes

458
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,750
in better from underneath the reason is

459
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,100
that a lot of the absorption takes place

460
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,380
through the snow mates which are those

461
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,939
little pores in the leaves many plants

462
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,220
have more snow mates on the underside of

463
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,630
the leaf than on the upper side honestly

464
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,308
I don't know if cannabis is in that

465
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,750
category or not do you have any ideas I

466
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:44,158
think that's true but I actually don't

467
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,869
know wonderful I need to get my

468
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:48,480
microscope out and have a look yeah but

469
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:50,639
number two there's more snow mates on

470
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,558
the underside be the spray stays wet on

471
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,000
the underside longer yeah so you're

472
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,158
gonna get better absorption from the

473
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,019
underside so to the extent a grower can

474
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,600
their folio nutrition should be directed

475
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:02,609
upward you made some really interesting

476
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:05,308
comments about silica applications using

477
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:08,069
a foliar spray to add silica alekan

478
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:09,899
silicon thank you so go to the beach

479
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:12,149
yeah there you go

480
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,659
silicon and there's some really

481
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,700
interesting functions that might be anti

482
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:18,990
pathogen or anti pest properties of the

483
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,509
silica where it fills in those spaces

484
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,519
and actually physically blocks infection

485
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:26,069
sites and I think there's an interesting

486
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,200
property of the pH it's very alkaline

487
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:32,939
typically the the silica do you think

488
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:35,370
the pH pressure itself would might

489
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:38,669
represent an anti microbial for example

490
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:41,009
against powdery mildew I think a lot of

491
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:42,870
the mechanism of that resistance in the

492
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:45,150
literature is from thicker cell walls

493
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:46,919
the alkalinity may have an effect yeah

494
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:50,850
you know

495
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:52,830
a lot of fungi grow better and I guess

496
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:54,719
in lower pH yep you know I was wondering

497
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:56,339
why can you put a bottle of Louisiana

498
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,798
Hot Sauce on a restaurant table for six

499
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:00,928
months it doesn't go bad it's the pH

500
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,579
bacteria don't grow well at low pH and

501
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:03,990
there's a lot of vinegar in there and

502
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:06,569
that's why it's hot sauce almost never

503
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,460
goes bad yeah it's well documented in

504
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:11,069
the literature that silicon helps plants

505
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,410
resist a fitzsimmons as well as powdery

506
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:14,460
mildew that's very well documented

507
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,870
scientifically and that's that's one

508
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,269
reason I like to have silicon in my

509
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:20,250
program yeah another reason is strong

510
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:22,470
shale walls for heavy bud formation it's

511
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,089
all about bud weight ultimately and then

512
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,240
the oil that you get out of there last

513
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:29,939
question for me regarding silicon do you

514
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,440
think it's equally effective being

515
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,850
applied as a root drench and or a foliar

516
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,679
both are fine okay

517
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:38,969
I mentioned the potassium silicon tends

518
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,570
to precipitate with other fertilizers

519
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,640
yeah so depending on a growers delivery

520
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:46,109
system sometimes I'll just say let's

521
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,600
just put the silicone on Foley early

522
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:51,058
yeah if they have an A&amp;B tank dual

523
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,909
delivery system yeah I can put potassium

524
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:55,829
silicate in with compatible nutrients in

525
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,960
the B tank so we don't have

526
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:59,909
precipitation but calcium silicate is

527
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,740
completely insoluble in calcium in

528
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,419
silicon and it's bombs away yep

529
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,400
could you add it in with that irrigation

530
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,960
on a day off for my fertigation another

531
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,630
way to do it yeah that's another way to

532
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,400
do it but I did I did all kind of

533
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,010
compatibility studies with my fertilizer

534
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,410
program I didn't have any problem with

535
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:18,569
anything until I put potassium silicate

536
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,009
in there for sure yeah so it doesn't

537
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:22,529
play well with others and so you either

538
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:24,629
need to put it on generally by itself

539
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:26,519
either through a drench or irrigation

540
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:31,040
application or as a foliar we're

541
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:31,039
extremely high dilution how would assume

542
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,799
corporate hundred gallons on most of the

543
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:39,089
products which is a one to four hundred

544
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:40,558
dilution yeah so you know and I'm again

545
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:42,178
I don't like to put a whole lot on of

546
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,710
anything of one time I don't want a

547
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,419
reputation of burning people's crops up

548
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,950
but for sure so I I'm a little

549
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,960
conservative in my application rates

550
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:51,150
yeah I have client to say whatever Lynne

551
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,798
does you just double it you know but I

552
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,480
don't like to take those chances so you

553
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,190
know can go on Foley early or it can go

554
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,690
through the roots your roots have to be

555
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,920
healthy yeah and functioning

556
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:05,410
so what Lynne is saying is less

557
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:07,390
is more yeah-yeah-yeah if I were a

558
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,150
cannabis grower commercially which I'm

559
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,920
not the medium that I would choose would

560
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,670
be a combination of coconut fiber

561
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,620
Canadian sphagnum peat and perlite

562
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:19,900
number one most container media have

563
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:22,239
multiple ingredients the reason for that

564
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,920
is as they fall together in different

565
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,539
combinations they create different types

566
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,920
of pore space for the roots to grow

567
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:31,569
within secondly Canadians Magnum is

568
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,920
naturally hydrophobic it repels water

569
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:37,839
coconut fiber is naturally hydrophilic

570
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:41,650
Magnum peat is a fine medium it's been

571
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,849
used for many many decades you grow a

572
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,009
heck of a root system when you have

573
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:46,750
coconut fiber in your mix that's partly

574
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:47,829
due to the physical structure of coconut

575
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,809
fiber and partly due to its high

576
00:21:47,829 --> 00:21:51,549
potassium content I like to put a little

577
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,460
gypsum in there for buffering and for

578
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:56,349
calcium and sulfur availability coconut

579
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,539
fiber is naturally high in potassium and

580
00:21:56,349 --> 00:22:01,299
low in calcium but it has a pretty good

581
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:03,460
pH in the 6s so it doesn't need dolomite

582
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:05,109
or limestone but to add calcium to it

583
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,090
gypsum is a great in an inexpensive way

584
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:08,559
to do that you get the benefit of

585
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:10,629
calcium and sulfur nutrition and you

586
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,389
also get some buffering to keep your pee

587
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:24,339
pH on

588
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:24,339
