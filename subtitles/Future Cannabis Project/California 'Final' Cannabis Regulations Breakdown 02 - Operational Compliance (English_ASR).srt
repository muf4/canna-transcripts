2
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:17,879
okay here at MLG there's kind of a

3
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:19,799
slight distinction between you know the

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,809
licensing side of things and then what I

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,778
called the operational compliance which

6
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:26,189
is kind of my my terrain is it's kind of

7
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:27,599
there's getting your license then

8
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,618
there's keeping it and not having it

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,899
taken away so a lot of this part of the

10
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,929
presentation is kind of a review because

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,969
so much of what happened in this round

12
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:42,090
is like everything we feared from the

13
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:45,390
last round happened so so we can review

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,399
that so I do like to start with let's

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,609
remember all the good news in the

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,429
positive things that happened one of the

17
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:56,628
big ones was that you can now put label

18
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:59,939
THC and CBD cannabinoid content after

19
00:00:56,628 --> 00:01:02,608
final form so the distributor's can can

20
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:05,128
label it so a significant percentage of

21
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,710
failures that was happening was because

22
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,079
of the label claims so this is a so this

23
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:11,819
is a big one that's going to help a lot

24
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,219
of products actually make it to market

25
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,929
without going through the loop of having

26
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,179
to real able because every test results

27
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,220
going to be slightly different

28
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,259
they made the exemption for tinctures

29
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:23,429
containing alcohol so that product type

30
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,810
got to survive

31
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,960
we got distribution to distribution

32
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,329
transfers thanks to SB 311 you have

33
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,669
retail to retail transfer clarification

34
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:35,069
so that a retailer an owner that owns

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,740
multiple stores can contract

36
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:40,529
distributors to move inventory between

37
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:43,949
those stores there's expanded events

38
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,890
location thanks to a be 20/20 evidently

39
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,680
for LA it's gonna be 20/20 right before

40
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,939
they get their local events they're like

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,649
there won't be any local events till

42
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,328
2020 and you're like no there's gonna be

43
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,700
a lot of them they just won't be

44
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:59,069
licensed a one another big win and this

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,649
one was that you can reject and accept

46
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,779
partial shipments there was a provision

47
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,509
previously that was either you had to

48
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,189
accept the whole shipment or reject it

49
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,618
if something was wrong now there's some

50
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:12,659
carve outs for if there's things that

51
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,289
aren't accurately reflected on there on

52
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,438
the shipping

53
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:18,810
FSU can not take those items if things

54
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:21,658
are visibly damaged you cannot take

55
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,158
those if it's non-compliant labeling

56
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:24,810
lies because your in taking you can

57
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:27,328
reject the non-compliant we labeled

58
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,949
goods and if things are past their

59
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:31,859
expired or best by date you cannot

60
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:34,229
accept those there's some remediation

61
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:36,959
for edibles so if you have I don't know

62
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:38,969
saya ten of blueberries in there over a

63
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,378
hundred milligrams you can actually take

64
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:41,878
a couple of blueberries out and

65
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:43,378
repackage it and be like now we got a

66
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:45,500
hundred milligrams so that's nice

67
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:49,828
instead of having to destroy it all oh

68
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,568
that's that's awesome there's some

69
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:53,519
higher action levels for the category

70
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:56,339
two solvents which will help some more

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,560
products make it to market as Josh was

72
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,789
saying lots of new forms it's gonna be

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,209
so much fun

74
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:04,949
filling those out and possibly a little

75
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:07,519
bit more clarity around some other

76
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:11,789
things and then there were other things

77
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,900
so I mean we still continue with with

78
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:18,289
the white-hot white labeling panic and

79
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:21,090
as Josh was saying like with the

80
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:22,858
expansion of definitions of ownership

81
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:28,348
and financially interested parties and

82
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:30,329
this detail in 50:32 be specifically

83
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:32,280
that licensees shall not conduct

84
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:35,069
commercial cannabis activities on behalf

85
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,348
of at the request of or pursuant to a

86
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:40,589
contract with any person that is not

87
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:42,689
licensed under the Act very problematic

88
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,500
for people who had white labeling

89
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:49,469
situations and less that they have a

90
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,620
license they're an owner or a disclose

91
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:54,389
as a financially interested party many

92
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,769
many people are thinking of many many

93
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:58,109
workarounds like well I'll go get

94
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,969
temporary event licenses and it's like

95
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:03,150
yet you still have to disclose the

96
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:06,539
owners in that situation too so the main

97
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,669
thing is the the thing that I see

98
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,959
overall and the revisions that they're

99
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:12,900
going through is you see that the

100
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,628
agencies are learning the agencies are

101
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,060
seeing where people are hiding money

102
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:19,379
where they're hiding owners where they

103
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,839
don't know what they're doing and

104
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,908
they're starting slowly but surely to

105
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,500
kind of like appeal a part of some of

106
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:26,649
those things some of these become really

107
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,168
problematic

108
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:33,549
because reactionary regulating is never

109
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:36,219
good for the long run but you you see

110
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,079
the process and you get to the concept

111
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,419
underneath it and the concept underneath

112
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:45,879
though this white labeling prohibition

113
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:48,250
is that if you can call it that is they

114
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,329
want to know who's playing they want to

115
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,668
know who's who

116
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:54,609
who's the participants they want and as

117
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:56,319
Josh said the warm bodies who is it

118
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,169
interested in not hiding behind entities

119
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:03,490
corporations you know not disclosures

120
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:05,649
whatever it's interesting you know they

121
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,319
in the previous version there was there

122
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:10,870
was rumor that like 50 32b was gonna get

123
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,519
struck they in the previous version they

124
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,800
had all of these kind of they laid out

125
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:16,959
the prohibitions of like what they meant

126
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,720
by commercial cannabis activities that

127
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,859
that maybe would be prohibited by non

128
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,470
licensees and this is got to be my

129
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,780
favorite thing if you read the final

130
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:32,560
statement of reasons it's beautiful

131
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:33,819
is that when they put that in and this

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,649
is from the final statement of reasons

133
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:37,329
from the BCC it says you know initially

134
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:39,310
they determined it was necessary to

135
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:40,779
assist licensees with determining what

136
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,680
types of activity by having these

137
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:46,509
examples however then they determined

138
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,120
that the inclusion of the examples

139
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:52,538
crossed more confusion than clarity so

140
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,550
they took them out that doesn't mean

141
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:56,439
that those examples are not legitimate

142
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,658
examples of what they mean by in

143
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,819
participating in cannabis and commercial

144
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:03,550
cannabis activity without a license

145
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:05,469
it just means that they if anything I

146
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,629
would suggest did not want to limit

147
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,930
themselves to only those definitions

148
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:13,360
that in fact this gives them a more

149
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,038
broad scope of being able to determine

150
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,069
on a case-by-case basis

151
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,629
what they consider to be engaging in

152
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:22,930
commercial cannabis activity without a

153
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:25,538
license now the funny thing is it I

154
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,240
don't know if they're just crazy or like

155
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:32,168
gaslighting us I have no idea but the

156
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,689
agencies say in conversations with Lorri

157
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:37,569
Ajax the the standard thing that we

158
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:39,939
understand as white labeling did not

159
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:40,449
enter their consciousness at all as what

160
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:43,899
they were

161
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:45,460
to prohibit so it's it's odd as we

162
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:48,399
proceed because they're not really

163
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:50,438
trying to shut down while the the

164
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:54,158
practice of white labeling as most of us

165
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:56,080
know it they in in one conversation it

166
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:58,478
was more that they went into retailers

167
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,709
and still found unlicensed product and

168
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,628
they were like we have to stop this

169
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:04,918
unlicensed product from getting into

170
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:07,658
retailers so this was their solution

171
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,938
there's a whole lot of other regulations

172
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:11,918
to prevent unlicensed rug from paying

173
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:14,710
out of retail locations so I'm not

174
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:19,180
really sure that that explanation is

175
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:20,888
sound but it's it's the one thing that

176
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,168
we know from all of the regulatory

177
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,999
agencies is they're not done regulating

178
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:26,829
there is still gonna be cleanup they're

179
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:28,629
still gonna be a new language that's why

180
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:29,978
I'm saying the permanent regulations are

181
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:33,430
never permanent because they're just

182
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:35,649
gonna keep refining this process but in

183
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,788
case just as a refresher anybody wants

184
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:39,430
to know when you're like well what's

185
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:41,498
commercial cannabis activity you can go

186
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,478
back to the definition of it from the

187
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:45,278
business and Professions Code which is

188
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:47,050
the cultivation possession manufacture

189
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:48,370
distribution processing storing lab

190
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,189
testing packaging labeling

191
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,168
transportation delivery or sale of

192
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:57,159
cannabis and cannabis products so any

193
00:07:53,168 --> 00:08:00,338
you know commercial cannabis activity we

194
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:04,509
saw the technology platform regulations

195
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:06,759
are stood and carried over so their

196
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:09,399
reasoning for this was that they found a

197
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,348
number of licensees were engaging

198
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,999
delivery services that were facilitated

199
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:14,949
by platforms but the use of the

200
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:18,430
platforms was creating confusion with

201
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:22,959
customers as to whether it was licensee

202
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:24,819
conducting that activity or not so some

203
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,069
technology platforms may create the

204
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:28,509
impression they hold a license and they

205
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:31,180
determined that it was necessary to

206
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:34,870
clarify that this is all from the final

207
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:37,000
statement of reasons so generally they

208
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,828
just kind of you know went a little more

209
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,528
granular this language was in the last

210
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:44,289
version in October that you know that

211
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:46,419
they can't sell or otherwise transfer a

212
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:48,818
good or licensed retailer through the

213
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:50,948
use of an unlicensed third party

214
00:08:48,818 --> 00:08:54,129
intermediary business broker or any

215
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:57,729
other business or entity but

216
00:08:54,129 --> 00:09:00,370
you can contract with the service that

217
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:03,519
provides a technology platform to

218
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,750
facilitate these sales and delivery and

219
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,730
then there's lots of step you know

220
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,950
stipulations in terms of what that has

221
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,170
to look like the products can't be

222
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,690
delivered by that technology platform

223
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:15,189
that technology platform can't share in

224
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,070
the profits of the sale of those

225
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:20,200
cannabis Goods or otherwise provide for

226
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,790
a percentage of the portion of the

227
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,900
cannabis good sales can't be provided to

228
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:29,349
them they can't advertise in conjunction

229
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:32,709
with the technology provider outside of

230
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,529
the platform and they cannot in the

231
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:38,290
technology platform can't use the

232
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:39,730
licensees license number to advertise in

233
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:42,339
any advertising and marketing that

234
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,310
primarily promotes that technology

235
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:49,210
platform incredibly specific they're

236
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:52,239
very very specific about this so in in

237
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:55,210
because back to that original reasoning

238
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,310
that it was to prevent the confusion of

239
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,430
knowing who you're buying from they

240
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:02,439
added in a lot of these disclosures that

241
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:04,599
those items offered for sale have to

242
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,330
disclose at a minimum the licensed

243
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,519
retailers or micro businesses legal

244
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,590
business name and license number

245
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,269
same thing with if it's ordered through

246
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,340
the platform they have to be able to see

247
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:16,629
the business name and the license number

248
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,750
that they are ordering those products

249
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:21,700
from before they make the purchase so if

250
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,200
you're on the platform and you're

251
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,030
looking at a product you need to in

252
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,700
advance of getting it and maybe seeing

253
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:29,589
it on the receipt know what licensed

254
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,230
dispensary is going to be delivering

255
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:37,000
this product that information has to be

256
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:38,710
on the receipt as well so so it gives me

257
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,269
good news about that I would say is it

258
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,310
gives a lot more visibility to the

259
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:43,750
retailers that are actually providing

260
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:49,419
the products that are being delivered

261
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:52,409
through these technology platforms so

262
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:57,099
one of the biggest wins obviously to

263
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:59,379
delivery was it was the delivery to a

264
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,110
physical address the part that held is

265
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:04,779
that you can deliver anywhere within the

266
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,730
state of California provided that such

267
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,528
delivery is conducted in compliance with

268
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,080
all delivery provision

269
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:13,028
I think that some of you probably saw

270
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,190
the League of Cities did the big one

271
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:17,769
during weed campaign with all these

272
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,980
beautiful cartoon children terrified of

273
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:23,649
the of the symbol so one of the

274
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,620
additions we saw was this subsection II

275
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:29,080
just to clarify delivery employees can't

276
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,470
deliver to a school so please don't do

277
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,709
that the kindergarten or one through

278
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:39,910
twelve college totally fine day care

279
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:42,429
center or Youth Center so the the

280
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:44,289
wandering weed site came down it's no

281
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:46,899
longer up they did it on Squarespace you

282
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:55,449
can tell by the lot of missing sight

283
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:57,458
signal so we saw the value that had

284
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,379
dropped previously from ten thousand to

285
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:02,169
five thousand of what can be carried in

286
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:03,519
the car at any time that stayed so you

287
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:06,579
have to have at least two thousand

288
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:11,159
dollars in orders to be sallying forth

289
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:15,089
on your delivery route the they had the

290
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:17,949
cage was clarified that the cage in the

291
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:20,470
delivery vehicles same as transportation

292
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:23,140
distribution vehicles now has to be a

293
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,660
fully enclosed separate box container a

294
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:27,939
cage then no portion of it shall be

295
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:29,949
comprised of any part of the vehicle or

296
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,339
trailer this is mirrored and

297
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:38,320
distribution that it has to be this

298
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:40,660
inside structure there's record-keeping

299
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,580
requirements for locations that stayed

300
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:45,189
in which is that the history of all

301
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,839
locations traveled while engaging in

302
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,730
delivery has to be maintained for a

303
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,890
minimum of 90 days so that's turn by

304
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:55,300
turn GPS records for all delivery

305
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:56,919
drivers has to be kept and kept for

306
00:12:55,299 --> 00:13:01,479
seven years because it falls under our

307
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:03,129
record-keeping provisions a super-fun

308
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,230
project for a lot of people is going to

309
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:07,809
be the now you can deliver to Catalina

310
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:13,889
the thing so good luck

311
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:17,399
this couldn't be fun there's a lot of

312
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:17,399
how they do it

313
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,179
a blonde was at the state of cannabis a

314
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,560
couple years ago and I was on a panel

315
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:26,859
she learned all this problem and get

316
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,599
them access and so what they found out

317
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,769
was that in Washington State and some of

318
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,528
these remote islands that they were

319
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,389
considering state-chartered votes to not

320
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:35,198
be federal water because you are on

321
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:37,720
state property

322
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:44,379
so that's other things about take care

323
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:46,209
of me not okay I'll not hold my breath

324
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:49,000
before they figure out how state

325
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:50,619
chartered boats is gonna work and what's

326
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,750
the fee structure for using a state

327
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:57,209
chartered boat to transport your

328
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,208
cannabis get some favor they want it

329
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,079
well yeah I mean it's interesting

330
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:03,458
because they'll have to be that's the

331
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:04,509
interesting thing that we've had is

332
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,250
there's gonna be have to be other

333
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:09,458
provisional carve-outs because it's

334
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,198
impossible in some ways to fulfill the

335
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:13,059
requirements for delivery such as a

336
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,469
vehicle with a cage and stuff when there

337
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:16,929
is not a single ferry boat that

338
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,389
transports vehicles to the island so

339
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:21,609
they would have to change all of the

340
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:23,528
transportation regulations for once you

341
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,769
get off the boat that you can hand carry

342
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:28,568
it to anywhere in Avalon and so so it's

343
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:30,370
it's a great concept and obviously the

344
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:34,139
people of Avalon deserve to have their

345
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,139
cannabis but it's but

346
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:10,819
in the constant the constant caveat in

347
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:12,889
everything we're doing is right now I'm

348
00:15:10,818 --> 00:15:15,048
talking about state regulations state

349
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:17,178
regulations are also a companion to

350
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:18,739
local regulations local regulations and

351
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:20,988
state regulations are a companion to

352
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:22,970
federal regulations and when all of

353
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:26,089
these things work together then we have

354
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:28,959
regulated cannabis so while it's fine

355
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:31,609
and good that now you can deliver to any

356
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:34,518
municipality in California that's great

357
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:37,069
certain localities have their own local

358
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:39,558
ordinances that restrict delivery for

359
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:42,498
example in the city of Bellflower you

360
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:51,078
can a delivery driver can only carry up

361
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:54,168
to 200 dollars at any time yeah yeah so

362
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:55,969
good luck ok good luck with your $3,000

363
00:15:54,168 --> 00:15:58,730
of goods in your trunk when you can only

364
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,798
collect $200 at any time to be in

365
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:03,619
accordance with the Bellflower local

366
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:05,298
ordinance so so I mean it's a much

367
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:07,069
greater conversation we'll kind of touch

368
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:09,379
on a little bit later of just like the

369
00:16:07,068 --> 00:16:12,198
problem of synthesizing the localities

370
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:15,918
with the state is immense and how in how

371
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:17,688
to keep in mind all that stuff in

372
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:20,619
general this is just some stuff about

373
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:22,730
advertising I know I know Wes knows this

374
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:24,439
whenever you can't find something that

375
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,699
you know is a regulation don't forget to

376
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:28,879
look in the business and Professions

377
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:30,918
Code because you can read the entire you

378
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,538
know cannabis regulations of the BCC and

379
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:34,308
think I don't have to put my license

380
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:36,288
number on a billboard no way there's

381
00:16:34,308 --> 00:16:38,480
nothing that says that guess what it's

382
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:40,399
in the business and Professions Code so

383
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,339
that's where you would go to look for

384
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,159
these statutory requirements such as

385
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:49,069
that all advertising and marketing has

386
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,078
to identify at a minimum the licensee

387
00:16:49,068 --> 00:16:53,238
responsible for that ad with their

388
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:55,219
license number a technology platform

389
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:57,619
cannot display an advertisement by a

390
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,850
licensee without a license number

391
00:16:57,619 --> 00:17:01,100
attached to it and in

392
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,170
door advertising company can't display

393
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,019
an advertisement unless they display the

394
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:08,869
license number so theoretically every ad

395
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:11,298
anywhere at all times you are seeing now

396
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:15,879
should have a license number on it

397
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:19,400
who's enforcing that who knows we'll see

398
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,689
the other prohibition that did hold and

399
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,089
came through from the last time was the

400
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:25,519
prohibition against marketing cannabis

401
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:27,230
goods as alcoholic products so you can't

402
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,329
sell or transport kamas goods that are

403
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,339
labeled as beer wine liquor spirits or

404
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:35,029
any other term that might create a

405
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:36,889
misleading impression this little

406
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:38,658
statements from the the final statement

407
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,159
of reasons they felt that was necessary

408
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:43,549
because since recently passed

409
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:45,380
legislation prohibits actually making a

410
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:47,690
cannabis alcoholic beverage they don't

411
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,870
want to confuse consumers by thinking

412
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:54,740
that cannabis wine is actually wine

413
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:57,168
so they they took that one away so they

414
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,240
and they extended that so they extended

415
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:01,490
the prohibition to anything that could

416
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,808
recreate the misleading impression that

417
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:10,519
the product may be an alcoholic beverage

418
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:13,038
so for retailers there was the limit on

419
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:15,710
the sale of non cannabis Goods state

420
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,509
this is a pretty limited definition of

421
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,640
what you can sell in addition to

422
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:22,730
cannabis Goods a licensed retailer may

423
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,270
only may sell only cannabis accessories

424
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:28,190
and any licensees branded merchandise so

425
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:29,538
in your retail store you can sell

426
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,940
cannabis you can sell cannabis

427
00:18:29,538 --> 00:18:34,429
accessories and you can sell branded

428
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,659
merchandise and then you can have

429
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:37,220
promotional materials they allow that

430
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:39,380
you can provide promotional materials

431
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,390
which is like informational pamphlets

432
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,880
things that have no monetary value that

433
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:46,788
are given to you by those organizations

434
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:50,299
in the final statement of reasons they

435
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:52,190
are incredibly specific so if you have

436
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:55,819
any questions about what exactly is a

437
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:57,500
cannabis accessory it's the the business

438
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:59,058
and Professions Code actually points to

439
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,650
the health and safety code for that

440
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:03,859
definition where it's still called

441
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:06,048
marijuana accessories and and kind of

442
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:07,879
broke that it has a pretty expansive

443
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:10,519
definition and that it's any equipment

444
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,299
products materials of any kind which are

445
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,099
used in ten

446
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:14,418
for use designed for use in planting

447
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:16,158
propagating cultivating growing

448
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,570
harvesting manufacturing compounding

449
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:19,850
converting producing processing

450
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:21,648
preparing testing analyzing packaging

451
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:25,099
repackaging storing smoking vaporizing

452
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:26,808
or containing marijuana or for ingesting

453
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:28,488
inhaling or otherwise inducing merry

454
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:31,788
introducing marijuana or marijuana

455
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:33,919
products into the human body it's

456
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:38,558
beautiful it's beautiful

457
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:42,919
so in the final statement of reasons

458
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:44,960
they get specific of what they mean that

459
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,028
cannabis retailers are licensed to sell

460
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,769
cannabis Goods the definition of

461
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:50,720
cannabis within the acts explicitly

462
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:52,548
excludes industrial hemp products

463
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,200
industrial hemp is regulated by the

464
00:19:52,548 --> 00:19:55,579
California industrial hit program under

465
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,278
the California industrial hemp farming

466
00:19:55,579 --> 00:20:00,019
act a retail license from the Bureau

467
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:01,608
other eise's retailer to sell cameras

468
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:03,499
goods and cannabis it does not authorize

469
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:05,918
them to sell items that are unrelated to

470
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:08,149
cannabis

471
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,980
so they're pretty clear you're not

472
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:13,308
supposed to be selling industrial hemp

473
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:16,159
products anymore they've been they've

474
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:18,408
been clear now branded merchandise the

475
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,019
thing that you are allowed to sell they

476
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:22,850
get specific on that to clothing hats

477
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,558
pencils pens keychains mugs water

478
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:27,709
bottles beverage glasses notepads and

479
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:30,408
lanyards and cannabis accessories that

480
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,389
are branded with the name and logo of a

481
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:34,220
commercial cannabis business that is a

482
00:20:32,388 --> 00:20:37,758
licensed commercial cannabis business if

483
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:40,308
it is not one of those listed items you

484
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,618
have to get written approval from the

485
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:44,839
bureau in order to carry that branded

486
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:46,668
merchandise you have to write to them

487
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:49,730
you have to send them a picture of it

488
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:51,769
and they have to approve it before you

489
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,058
can sell that additional branded

490
00:20:51,769 --> 00:21:03,829
merchandise and the branded merchandise

491
00:20:53,058 --> 00:21:05,628
has to be from a licensee sure a bong I

492
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:11,599
would say is a cannabis accessory it

493
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:14,418
goes under that definition of yeah

494
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,189
cannabis accessories is a subdivision of

495
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:20,710
branded merchandise so you can brand

496
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:20,710
your cannabis accessories as well yeah

497
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,509
that would not be something have the

498
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,279
SBCC about that would not be permitted

499
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:36,819
because it's not branded merchandise by

500
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,920
a licensee it would be if you viewed the

501
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:41,619
branded merchandise is and you know you

502
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,289
can't sell Nike sneakers you know cuz

503
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:46,629
that's branded merchandise or whatever

504
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:48,519
it it would be that if you wanted to

505
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,530
partner with an Instagram person and put

506
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:52,629
your name and logo and license number on

507
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:54,819
that then that might be where you could

508
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,170
get something approved in that way but

509
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:57,490
it seems that they're being very

510
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,070
specific that the branded merchandise

511
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,720
should be of a licensee this is

512
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,250
something I would ask you know your

513
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,440
friendly neighborhood attorney about

514
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,240
because in that final statement of

515
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,920
reasons when they're saying that

516
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,679
clarification that a retail license

517
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,870
authorizes you to sell cannabis what I

518
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,210
deduce from that is they're saying like

519
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:18,519
getting a retail cannabis license does

520
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,380
not give you authorize you to sell like

521
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:23,139
Coke and Doritos like you have to get a

522
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,400
city lease business permit that you have

523
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,410
to it's a different kind of seller's

524
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,769
permit you do that things and what a lot

525
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,029
of retailers are doing is segmenting

526
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:33,069
their businesses so that you have your

527
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:34,450
cannabis retail area where you're

528
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:36,460
selling your cannabis products and then

529
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,110
you have another non lace you know not

530
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,450
part of that area where you're selling

531
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:42,490
everything else and you can and you can

532
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,590
get your city business permanent and do

533
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,539
your thing there and pay your taxes that

534
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:48,250
way because of course for the amount

535
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:50,589
you're being taxed for your retail space

536
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:55,170
why would you sell Doritos there you

537
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:55,169
want to sell them somewhere else yeah

538
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:15,310
I mean if it's a cannabis well it's a

539
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:33,129
cannabis product at that point as long

540
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:35,440
as it's a business anything that is a

541
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:38,170
branded product is a non cannabis

542
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,880
product and they are very specific to

543
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:45,160
about those branded products it's not

544
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:47,410
food like you can't make it no no any

545
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:52,560
licensee yeah yeah so you can sell any

546
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:54,790
other licensees branded products exactly

547
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,409
exactly because I would imagine that

548
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:58,599
what you are gonna have is just like you

549
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,640
have manufacturing brands or cultivator

550
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:02,379
brands that are you know brands and

551
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,420
logos in themselves that they are going

552
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:18,490
to want to sell that branded merchandise

553
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:20,080
through retail yeah yeah well claiming

554
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,509
health benefits is a whole other ball of

555
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,960
wax you don't want a tussle with go

556
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:24,940
ahead

557
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,319
I mean it's a great question in terms of

558
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,150
what enforcement's gonna look like and

559
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:32,049
who's gonna be responsible and and

560
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:33,820
that's kind of the big issue I mean

561
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:35,740
especially for the compliance folks is

562
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:37,329
it's it's difficult to prioritize or

563
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,220
convince people that this is important

564
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:41,649
when there seems to be such a lack of

565
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,779
visible enforcement or that it's very

566
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:46,420
kind of pick and choose nila haystack

567
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:48,700
but we have had enforcement actions

568
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,200
happen where agencies are going into

569
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,259
retailers and pulling product off the

570
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,730
shelf that's non-compliant and and

571
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:58,299
they're getting more and more specific

572
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:00,490
about it my concern is always right now

573
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:01,899
obviously the agencies are in this

574
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,339
period of where they've got all the

575
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,470
temporary licensed applicator you know

576
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:07,569
there's a lot going on right now but

577
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:11,110
once they've been they are beating up

578
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:14,409
their teams they're having huge staff

579
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:15,769
increases and next year when they're

580
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:18,019
bored on a Tuesday

581
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:20,210
it's my concern as it becomes the new

582
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:23,808
smash-and-grab because it's like it's so

583
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:27,579
easy to walk into any retailer any

584
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:31,190
facility any way and find egregious in

585
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:33,918
gigantic compliance violations you know

586
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,149
it may not seem like a big deal but when

587
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,038
you start going through their

588
00:25:35,148 --> 00:25:38,959
disciplinary actions and their and the

589
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:41,269
penalties and fees that they can levy

590
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,679
you know the one that comes up later in

591
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:45,859
this I mean there's a there's an

592
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,140
administrative fine for record-keeping

593
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:50,240
that can be as high as $30,000 per

594
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,770
instance of not keeping accurate records

595
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,899
so it's like they have I mean which is

596
00:25:53,769 --> 00:26:00,679
like fear police but it's like it's it's

597
00:25:56,898 --> 00:26:03,709
really is a vulnerable position because

598
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:05,570
there's just so many nuances and

599
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,788
regulations and interpretations which is

600
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:10,129
why it's really critical to at this

601
00:26:07,788 --> 00:26:12,230
moment be practicing all of these things

602
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,450
for record-keeping for inventory for in

603
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:18,079
taking product all those processes and

604
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:20,509
also building your internal compliance

605
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,369
program your compliance team your legal

606
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:25,038
team making sure that those things are

607
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:27,048
in place because it's you know it

608
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:33,278
they've really got the industry in the

609
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:33,278
crosshairs in many ways yeah

610
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:50,609
like we're never gonna see like a

611
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,370
statewide campaign going against branded

612
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:56,399
schwag being sold at retailers but where

613
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:58,319
this might come into play is if they get

614
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,820
a complaint about you somebody complains

615
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,039
that you're selling to kids and they

616
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:03,839
send an agent there and while the agents

617
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,940
there you know they clearly see that

618
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,679
you're not selling the kids but oh by

619
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,480
the way while we're out here we noticed

620
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,730
that you have this unbranded approved

621
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,200
branded merchandise and that's where

622
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,240
they could just come up and cite you

623
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,930
because these enforcement agencies at

624
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:21,569
the end of the day they're driven by and

625
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:24,240
demographics and and demographics as to

626
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:25,980
like what types of discipline and

627
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,450
charges they're able to prove up because

628
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,490
they've got a budget they get it each

629
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:32,130
year from the state so they need to be

630
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:34,859
able to point to results and say that

631
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,870
we've you know identified ten thousand

632
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:39,539
you know infractions over the last year

633
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:40,769
we need more money because you know we

634
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,500
want to be able to get twelve thousand

635
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:45,150
infractions next year so you know it's a

636
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,009
roundabout way of saying that you know

637
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,560
they're on the books and and it really

638
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:51,779
becomes a tool for them to use when they

639
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:55,200
want to go after somebody but it may not

640
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:58,829
necessarily be like a statewide primary

641
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,660
enforcement mechanism yeah and in

642
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:02,879
something that I like to remind people

643
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,430
of is right now especially for licensees

644
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,290
that are really suffering within the you

645
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,779
know the unlicensed market and that kind

646
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:11,250
of competition where what you have is at

647
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:13,559
the beginning of an industry beginning

648
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,329
to howl for enforcement as a solution

649
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,339
and I like to caution people to be

650
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:18,839
incredibly specific about what you mean

651
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:20,609
when you ask for enforcement because

652
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:23,220
when you're asking the BCC for

653
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:27,059
enforcement the BCC enforces against

654
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,589
licensees what the illicit market and

655
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:30,509
the unlicensed market is a criminal

656
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:32,129
activity at this point and that is the

657
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:34,920
wing that would have to enforce against

658
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:37,080
that activity and we'll touch on this

659
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,570
later but obviously a lot of the problem

660
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,669
in those areas is about pathways to

661
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:43,980
licensure and how difficult that is with

662
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:46,110
local authorizations that there's a lot

663
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,940
of folks that would get licensed if the

664
00:28:46,109 --> 00:29:00,329
localities kind of made that

665
00:28:47,940 --> 00:29:02,220
a little easier yeah that is accurate

666
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:05,308
yes you are no longer supposed to be

667
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,259
carrying CBD products that are derived

668
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:09,599
from hemp that are not gotten from a

669
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:11,819
licensed cannabis cultivators

670
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,259
manufacturer producer all of the

671
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:14,609
agencies have been very clear you are

672
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:16,528
not supposed to have that stuff anymore

673
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:18,628
so if there is still a distributor that

674
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:21,450
is supplying hemp products actually if I

675
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:23,579
keep on going there's like I will list

676
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:27,200
the ways in which they tell you across

677
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:27,199
the board absolutely not honey

678
00:29:41,308 --> 00:29:45,970
yeah yeah I mean that yes it's a

679
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,679
different taxation but in the end that

680
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,600
there were people rampantly created

681
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,220
committing tax fraud knowingly because

682
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,659
they were placing excise tax on hemp

683
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,058
products they're not doing it on

684
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,890
cannabis products it's it's a messy

685
00:29:55,058 --> 00:29:58,990
problem that is gonna take a while

686
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:01,538
and it's only gonna get Messier now with

687
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,950
confusion around the relevance of the

688
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:04,298
farm bill and what that means and

689
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,730
different guidance coming from different

690
00:30:04,298 --> 00:30:25,058
places it's it's gonna be an ugly time

691
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:26,829
so yeah yeah if you have a shop on

692
00:30:25,058 --> 00:30:28,750
Venice Beach that is a non cannabis

693
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:30,908
dispensary you can sell a t-shirt with a

694
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:34,029
cannabis leaf on it all day long if you

695
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:35,770
are a licensed dispensary operating

696
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:38,230
under a cannabis license and in your

697
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:39,970
cannabis retail area you can only sell

698
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:45,220
branded merchandise that is branded by a

699
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:51,329
licensee so what if you manufacture you

700
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:51,329
can do that if you're a licensee no yeah

701
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:02,558
well this would be my question would be

702
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:06,490
where is this giant is it inside your

703
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:07,690
store yes so yes so these specific

704
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,480
things that I'm going through right here

705
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,669
is advertising and marketing so this is

706
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,529
kind of like there-there's exceptions

707
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:16,120
and you'd have to look at them closely

708
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:18,428
and get granular as there's things that

709
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:20,259
can happen inside your store that aren't

710
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:22,620
considered advertising and marketing and

711
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:25,029
then outside the store is so this

712
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:27,129
specifically is talking about that your

713
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:30,009
advertising and marketing cannot show a

714
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,929
depiction of a minor of inflatables of a

715
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:35,440
movie character of a cartoon character

716
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:38,769
that in your marketing you cannot do

717
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,230
those they cleaned it up you know and

718
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:43,389
this is they have some great thoughts

719
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,610
around you know what is appealing to

720
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,740
people or minors or anyone under 21

721
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:49,509
years of old age this is an important

722
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,960
fact to for anybody that's cleaning up

723
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:52,750
your old

724
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,360
list if you have had medical clientele

725
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,970
who are 18 years old between the ages of

726
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:59,648
eighteen and until they're 21

727
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:01,808
you cannot advertise to those people

728
00:31:59,648 --> 00:32:03,729
that they are not an advertising

729
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:06,190
candidate we only advertising people

730
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:08,048
over 21 years old so especially in the

731
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,028
case if you're doing direct marketing so

732
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:12,069
if you have a text list or you're doing

733
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:14,349
emails and you haven't cleaned up your

734
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:16,869
email list and you are direct marketing

735
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:18,730
to 18 19 and 20 year olds you're gonna

736
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:20,589
want to clean that up

737
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:22,599
because the people who used to be your

738
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:24,220
clientele and you were it may have been

739
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:25,418
telling them about deals and promos

740
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:29,950
you're not telling them about that

741
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:31,778
anymore so the one of the things that

742
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,419
did come through that's important for

743
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:36,609
record-keeping is that there was this

744
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,679
audience composition data this

745
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:42,038
mysterious audience comes with some data

746
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:45,159
that they request and now they have put

747
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:46,960
in that this your ads show be displayed

748
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:49,390
and this may seem like a no-brainer but

749
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,730
they're specific now after you've gotten

750
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:53,980
that audience composition data so and

751
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,750
not only do you have to have it you

752
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,038
really have to have it because much like

753
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,619
other records you have to be able to

754
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,119
produce it immediately upon request so

755
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:02,428
it's not like let me call the company

756
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,048
and I'm sure they have it somewhere

757
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:06,669
before you place an ad before you put up

758
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:09,158
a billboard you have to have that

759
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:10,330
audience composition data again look at

760
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:12,309
it closely because a lot of those

761
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:14,168
companies they do at eighteen plus

762
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:17,200
you've got to make sure that it's 21

763
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:18,730
plus on that composition data and they

764
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,890
added this line that used to be my

765
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:23,079
favorite line for employee training

766
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,700
which is there's another section where

767
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:27,908
it says and construing and forcing the

768
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,919
the act that any action omission or

769
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:31,750
failure on the part of an employee is

770
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,640
the licensees fault now they've added

771
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,740
that any action omission or failure on

772
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,110
the part of an advertising agent or

773
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:40,450
representative or contractor for

774
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:43,178
marketing and licensing is your fault as

775
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:45,069
the licensee so clearly is because the

776
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:47,110
BCC can't enforce against advertising

777
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:49,808
companies if you get the advertising

778
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:52,449
company to say hey we just say that it's

779
00:33:49,808 --> 00:33:54,700
21 up can you help me out here it is

780
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,700
your problem if that if that information

781
00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:01,149
proves faulty it is your problem so if

782
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,889
that audience composition data is still

783
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:03,548
there and I know I keep saying this

784
00:34:02,888 --> 00:34:04,868
every time

785
00:34:03,548 --> 00:34:06,940
we're all gonna do it together we're

786
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:10,298
gonna stop saying free you cannot

787
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:13,720
advertise you cannot advertise free

788
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:15,099
products tub it um no matter how craft

789
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:19,298
do you think you're being nothing's free

790
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:20,679
anymore so Dave Dave this is in relation

791
00:34:19,298 --> 00:34:23,230
to advertising marketing again you

792
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:26,099
cannot advertise free cannabis goods are

793
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:29,108
it giveaways of any type of products

794
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:31,088
including non cannabis products so not

795
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:33,068
only can you not say like get a free

796
00:34:31,088 --> 00:34:36,000
pre-roll you can't say get a free

797
00:34:33,068 --> 00:34:40,858
t-shirt you can't say get a free lighter

798
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,628
you depends where you are it depends it

799
00:34:40,858 --> 00:34:46,869
this is where this is where you cannot

800
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:50,798
advertise you cannot advertise that that

801
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:52,419
is happening so they get specific it

802
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:54,009
can't be buy one product and one product

803
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:57,098
it can't be free with donation it can't

804
00:34:54,010 --> 00:35:01,020
be contest sweepstakes or raffles this

805
00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:05,140
is my favorite reasoning in the whole

806
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:07,539
thing is in their statement of reasons

807
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:10,568
the reason why you cannot have a raffle

808
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:12,369
is because they have deemed that the

809
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:18,068
dissemination of promotional giveaways

810
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:22,030
may appeal to underage people so we

811
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:24,818
can't have raffles because a minor might

812
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:26,589
want to do it it might be likely to and

813
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:29,440
I was like you know you know what

814
00:35:26,588 --> 00:35:32,558
raffles and sweepstakes are appealing to

815
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,679
freaking older people who have jobs and

816
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:38,380
no money like that to my kid doesn't

817
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:39,368
care about a raffle election doesn't

818
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:44,079
even know what that means

819
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:45,700
that's it there's no I love the

820
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,700
statement of reasons it's brilliant it's

821
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:53,828
brilliant so so yes but back to your

822
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:56,558
statement George this their localities

823
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:57,818
it's a beautiful tear I had I almost put

824
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:02,319
it in again because it's my favorite

825
00:35:57,818 --> 00:36:05,679
slide the the state says you cannot give

826
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:07,568
away any free canvas goods yeah the

827
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,649
business and Professions Code says you

828
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:11,798
cannot give away Canada goods or

829
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:13,630
cannabis accessories Los Angeles says

830
00:36:11,798 --> 00:36:16,449
you can't give away cannabis Goods

831
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,900
canvas accessories or anything else so

832
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:20,269
depending on

833
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:23,829
accessories also a tobacco accessory

834
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:23,829
does it have to be 21 and over

835
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:35,799
granular legally I mean that um I mean

836
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:37,730
that's that's the thing if it is what my

837
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,130
understanding is is if it is in your

838
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:42,019
store as a cannabis dispensary it is no

839
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,730
longer a tobacco product because you

840
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:46,099
cannot sell tobacco products you know

841
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:50,590
it's a cannabis accessory but that would

842
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:50,589
be I mean that that kind of gets into

843
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:56,120
that's what I'm saying is it is depends

844
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,909
on the locality because you'd have to

845
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,949
look at local prohibitions like Los

846
00:36:58,909 --> 00:37:02,809
Angeles for example says you cannot give

847
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:05,179
away anything of any kind including

848
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:07,159
cannabis so they're like you can't even

849
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:08,649
give away t-shirt theoretically in Los

850
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:21,230
Angeles

851
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:22,880
ya know our you know dinner generally

852
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,590
generally I'd like to caution everybody

853
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,920
not to give anything away ever that's

854
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:29,450
like just don't do it but but that's

855
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,340
where it becomes critical that different

856
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:34,099
localities have different prohibitions

857
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:36,829
against certain things and the thing to

858
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:40,579
remember is that the state Trump's it

859
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:42,289
all the localities can have rules that

860
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:43,639
are more restrictive than the state but

861
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:47,469
they can't have rules that are less

862
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:47,469
restrictive than the state yeah

863
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:14,318
if you're in Los Angeles yes no that's

864
00:38:12,548 --> 00:38:16,059
anywhere that is now the state you

865
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:16,719
cannot have a contest of sweepstakes or

866
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:18,700
a raffle

867
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:20,828
you cannot and that's not just limited

868
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:23,139
to cannabis Goods that is nothing you

869
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:36,130
can't offer to give a free anything to

870
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:39,098
anybody for them I mean I love that

871
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:42,190
little silly I agree how they keep up I

872
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:45,250
don't know but yeah I mean it becomes it

873
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:47,980
because obviously everything cannabis

874
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,869
has been a population of people who are

875
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,210
pretty okay with certain kinds of risk

876
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:55,329
you know for a lot of years so for every

877
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:57,250
company it's fine what I would say is

878
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:59,109
now that they have put in that little

879
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:01,389
part that any act omission or failure of

880
00:38:59,108 --> 00:39:03,130
your advertising company that may be in

881
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:06,278
compliance with everything is is the

882
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:08,710
your licensees issue that's of concern I

883
00:39:06,278 --> 00:39:10,239
mean that requires because I know I know

884
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:11,889
it's like the new it used to be

885
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:13,868
everybody's like I know the best master

886
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:16,389
grower ever and now it's like I have the

887
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:17,980
most compliant POS ever I have the thing

888
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:21,759
my thing works too there you know it's

889
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:23,619
like compliance is a I'm thinking it's a

890
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:26,019
philosophical concept because it's kind

891
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:27,880
of like it's it's a difficult thing to

892
00:39:26,018 --> 00:39:30,939
wrangle because it's an ever-evolving

893
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,380
thing so they may be in they may be in

894
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,000
compliance with what the emergency

895
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,410
regulations are but I don't know how

896
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,130
they'd be in compliance with what just

897
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:41,129
came out and you know few days ago yeah

898
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,179
and gives France so there's there's no

899
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,858
kind of license we can have so which

900
00:39:48,179 --> 00:40:10,739
leaves us in a gray area because we're

901
00:39:49,858 --> 00:40:12,539
not I mean I may have used the term

902
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:19,189
prohibition through regulation a few

903
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:19,190
times in my casual conversations yeah

904
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:31,588
yeah I mean I don't want to go too far

905
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,859
down the rabbit hole in this because I

906
00:40:31,588 --> 00:40:37,259
have a lot more to cover but I would say

907
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:39,179
you need to look very very closely about

908
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,950
how these things interact with other

909
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:42,419
regulations because there's the branded

910
00:40:40,949 --> 00:40:44,489
merchandise and then there's no free

911
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,389
products and then there's other areas in

912
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:48,149
the regs where it's like a

913
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:49,739
representative of another licensee can't

914
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:52,200
give anything to anybody in your store

915
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:56,149
so so it's important to kind of tie them

916
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,149
all together and not just take one spot

917
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:01,949
yeah yes that's why I just AM like can

918
00:41:00,449 --> 00:41:03,868
everybody just stop trying to give

919
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:05,789
everything away for free because if you

920
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:07,050
actually have a transaction and a record

921
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:08,730
of a transaction and you fulfill

922
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,318
record-keeping requirements and you

923
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:13,139
carry the taxes over correctly for the

924
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,119
right items in in in large part problem

925
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:17,670
solved and that's where I just think

926
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,240
about think about the agencies think

927
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:23,760
about their fears and the fear is

928
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:27,179
diversion and like who's playing and cry

929
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,880
so it's like give them visibility on the

930
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:34,500
movement of everything and then you know

931
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,910
they see what they need to see so we we

932
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,679
have this engines the last one for the

933
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:41,179
BCC then there's many other things to

934
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:43,469
talk about the child resistant packaging

935
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:47,068
exit package 14 or whatever you want to

936
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:51,659
call it this is we we had a shift back

937
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:53,429
that's wonderfully confusing to package

938
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:56,239
or not to package that is the question

939
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:56,239
that's what I say

940
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:02,210
so the way they put it is it all

941
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:04,140
cannabis goods sold by a licensee

942
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:05,970
retailer has to be in compliance with

943
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:08,429
the packaging requirements those are

944
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:10,469
described in the CD pH and we'll go a

945
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:13,639
little bit into that so beginning on

946
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:16,289
January 1st 2020 you have to do the full

947
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:18,210
kahuna we do resealable tamper-evident

948
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:21,838
and child resistant with some

949
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:23,608
granulations around product type all

950
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:24,929
cannabis goods purchased by a customer

951
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:27,239
can't leave the relations retailer

952
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:30,598
premises unless it's in an opaque exit

953
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:31,798
bag and then they clarified they added

954
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,390
the clarifying line that the immature

955
00:42:31,798 --> 00:42:35,068
plants and seeds don't have to be put

956
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:36,509
into an exit bag please don't put a

957
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:40,769
little cloning next to bags let it

958
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:44,609
breathe so so those can go out and a

959
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:48,088
opaque bag so until that date because

960
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:50,338
that's Dan we're first 2020 this they

961
00:42:48,088 --> 00:42:51,298
inserted the line the child resistant

962
00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:55,019
packaging requirements

963
00:42:51,298 --> 00:42:56,909
may be met through the use of a child

964
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:58,588
resistant exit package at retail sale

965
00:42:56,909 --> 00:43:03,000
that's the department public health

966
00:42:58,588 --> 00:43:04,679
saying that the business and Professions

967
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,599
Code I mean what they're trying to do is

968
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:08,879
to comply with what's in the business

969
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:10,859
and Professions Code while providing

970
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,019
licensees with time to comply with

971
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:14,548
packaging requirements some of us are

972
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:15,809
confused because the packaging

973
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:17,880
requirements were supposed to be

974
00:43:15,809 --> 00:43:19,230
complied with back in July so we've been

975
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,430
complying with them for almost six

976
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:25,920
months but now they're like you need

977
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:27,989
more time so this again is it is a

978
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,119
greater you know if there's more clarity

979
00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:32,009
hopefully to come but the thought is

980
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,200
that because they're saying you may

981
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:36,480
satisfy the packaging requirement with

982
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:38,250
an exit bag that it would stand to

983
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,568
reason that a product already in child

984
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,880
resistant packaging could theoretically

985
00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:42,989
you leave in an opaque bag but a product

986
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,579
that's not in child resistant packaging

987
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:49,919
would have to be put in an exit bag most

988
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:51,450
attorneys I'm gonna guess advising their

989
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,750
clients are going to say put it in an

990
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:56,098
exit bag because how do you know and are

991
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,568
you gonna take the liability of like

992
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:00,720
whoops that wasn't actually he's child

993
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:02,460
resistant I was wrong I mean and as I

994
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,098
shared last time that that's the issue

995
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,230
is that we find ourselves in this Kafka

996
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:08,640
esque or a Boros of putting child

997
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,710
resistant packaging inside of child

998
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:15,118
resistant packaging

999
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:18,358
and and we're hoping on this issue that

1000
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:21,358
with the incoming administration in

1001
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:23,039
Sacramento and you know that possibly

1002
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,989
there will be some legislative changes

1003
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,338
there's talk about environmental groups

1004
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:27,719
getting involved in Sierra Club being

1005
00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:30,150
involved because obviously we just have

1006
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:32,669
an ecological disaster on our hands of

1007
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:34,829
of this this amount of packaging and the

1008
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:37,800
unsustainability and those issues but

1009
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:41,130
for now that's what they have there for

1010
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,980
the solution so a little bit that came

1011
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:46,260
out in the CD pH Department of Health

1012
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,358
for manufacturers it was interesting I

1013
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:50,310
love that they added just one word just

1014
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:52,920
one word in here which is homogeneity in

1015
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:54,480
terms of the definition and it's

1016
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,300
important because this is just something

1017
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,039
that from the agency from the department

1018
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,570
Public Health there's this kind of the

1019
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,639
best because you can tell that they went

1020
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:04,530
on some tours and they were horrified

1021
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,509
like they that's what you've read is

1022
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:10,260
you've read it and they're like what is

1023
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:12,359
happening so they put in homogeneity

1024
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,760
just so people would understand that

1025
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:16,108
your processes and procedures need to be

1026
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,660
developed with the in goal of

1027
00:45:16,108 --> 00:45:21,449
homogeneity uniformity THD throughout

1028
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:23,399
not just passing free from contaminants

1029
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:25,588
because they're obviously finding some

1030
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,930
some hot blueberries and it's like you

1031
00:45:25,588 --> 00:45:31,079
guys got to spread that out across the

1032
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:32,639
board I also find interesting this is

1033
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:34,199
back to the BCC we remember that

1034
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:35,639
designation of owner that Josh was

1035
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:38,338
talking about and they removed all these

1036
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:40,710
specifics out of it and there was a line

1037
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:42,329
in there that was wonderfully vague that

1038
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:45,240
said any individual that assumes

1039
00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:48,358
responsibility for the licensee could be

1040
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:50,879
considered an owner the beautiful thing

1041
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:53,250
is they move that line to the CD pH Rex

1042
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,930
so that one appeared over there so now

1043
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,030
in owners and financial adjust holders

1044
00:45:54,929 --> 00:45:58,858
and Department of Health we have the

1045
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:01,830
beautifully vague any individual that

1046
00:45:58,858 --> 00:46:04,559
assumes responsibility for a license and

1047
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:07,500
this was one again in the BCC that they

1048
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,119
put in there to clarify cause more

1049
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,800
confusion so instead of further

1050
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:15,150
clarifying they just took it out and

1051
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:19,220
it's like no more clarity for you so on

1052
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:22,230
the city pH side beginning January 1st

1053
00:46:19,219 --> 00:46:23,929
2020 everything has to be child

1054
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:25,159
resistant veiled I'm just going to

1055
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:29,568
through these because I don't know how

1056
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:32,088
many you can read it it's um they get

1057
00:46:29,568 --> 00:46:34,130
granular on what that's gonna look like

1058
00:46:32,088 --> 00:46:37,429
in 2020 this is the future man let's

1059
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:38,838
live in the present so they did add more

1060
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:41,210
clarification on what is considered

1061
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:43,818
child resistant in response to a lot of

1062
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:48,409
questions that they were getting a very

1063
00:46:43,818 --> 00:46:50,088
important thing in cannabinoid content

1064
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:53,509
labeling that I want to point out to

1065
00:46:50,088 --> 00:46:55,190
everybody is that with that now delayed

1066
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:58,278
possibility of putting testing results

1067
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:59,929
on after it's in its final form you can

1068
00:46:58,278 --> 00:47:02,298
have a distributor and can sticker it

1069
00:46:59,929 --> 00:47:04,419
after however they did add that the

1070
00:47:02,298 --> 00:47:08,119
manufacturer shall identify a location

1071
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:11,000
for the cannabinoid content label on the

1072
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:12,410
outer packaging of the product so this

1073
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,969
is just for everybody who's already been

1074
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:15,889
through a hundred designs of their

1075
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:17,838
packaging now you have to include if

1076
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:19,699
you're gonna have it sticker later you

1077
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:21,318
have to see if you have to demarcate

1078
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:23,239
where they're supposed to put that

1079
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:25,009
sticker some people may have already

1080
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:26,598
done that Lots I've seen didn't they

1081
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:30,079
then put it on there so now you got to

1082
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:33,740
put a spot they they put more clarity in

1083
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,930
terms of how to do cannabinoid content

1084
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:37,308
labeling for pre-rolls the CD pH didn't

1085
00:47:35,929 --> 00:47:39,469
really realize that they needed to do

1086
00:47:37,309 --> 00:47:42,710
that before they were like oh you want

1087
00:47:39,469 --> 00:47:45,318
us to tell you okay so now they got a

1088
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:47,119
lot more specific about how about is

1089
00:47:45,318 --> 00:47:50,420
expressed how cannabinoid content is

1090
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:52,579
expressed that it's one thing for flower

1091
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:54,789
and then you have an option with infused

1092
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:57,440
pre-rolls that you can either do it in

1093
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:59,869
milligrams or the flower expressed as a

1094
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,409
percentage in the additional concentrate

1095
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:06,318
asbestos they got a little because

1096
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:08,568
people like to be funny oh yeah and then

1097
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:10,940
they added this for THC CBD that's less

1098
00:48:08,568 --> 00:48:12,650
than two milligrams per package you can

1099
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:14,420
say less than two milligrams per package

1100
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:15,920
obviously companies that are actually

1101
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:17,869
doing micro dosing and want to be

1102
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:22,010
specific they don't have to but you

1103
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:23,568
can't so in the labeling restrictions

1104
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:25,039
there were a couple new things added to

1105
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:26,778
the labeling restrictions because again

1106
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,839
they're onto you guys would be being

1107
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:31,849
tricky so the name of a California

1108
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:33,679
County we know Appalachians you can't

1109
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:34,849
say it's from Humboldt if it's can't say

1110
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,739
it's from Mendocino if it's not a

1111
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:37,100
hundred percent you can also not use

1112
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:39,019
this

1113
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:41,029
similar name that's designed to mislead

1114
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:44,840
people so you can't say like min dough's

1115
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:45,650
with like a Z is like none of that don't

1116
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,510
do it

1117
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:49,789
same thing with candy and candies you

1118
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:53,930
can't spell candy with a K you can't be

1119
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:56,119
like candies but you doing it as you

1120
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:58,250
know edibles had to be an opaque

1121
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:59,900
packaging they also clarified you can't

1122
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:01,519
put a picture on what's in it on the

1123
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,200
package it's there's a reason they don't

1124
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:04,969
want it to be visible don't put a

1125
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:06,679
picture of the food inside on it you

1126
00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:09,199
can't do the same trickery with the word

1127
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:16,759
organic by putting in making it organics

1128
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:19,039
with an X don't do it just tub it so a

1129
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,990
lot of the stuff in the CD pH 2 was just

1130
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,059
it looks like a lot more new I think

1131
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:24,849
than it is because they really

1132
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:27,440
reorganize things and moved it around

1133
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:29,389
for the manufacturers you're gonna want

1134
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,730
to look at things like the Mannie Master

1135
00:49:29,389 --> 00:49:34,699
manufacturing protocol there was some a

1136
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:37,150
lot more kind of clarity and the need

1137
00:49:34,699 --> 00:49:40,569
for written instructions for mitigating

1138
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:44,420
identified risks is in there they added

1139
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:50,930
product quality control plan information

1140
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:52,369
in there the GMP s they welcome to the

1141
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:54,169
health and safety code they pointed out

1142
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:56,119
about 21 times in this new one to the

1143
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:57,470
health and safety code I put it on the

1144
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:59,509
list of things I never in my life

1145
00:49:57,469 --> 00:50:02,809
thought I would read as a child and now

1146
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:04,670
it's on there so they also added

1147
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:10,549
requirements for a quality control

1148
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:12,619
program this is you know these ones that

1149
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:14,269
are really telling that I've talked to

1150
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:16,029
some people at this CD pH about this

1151
00:50:14,269 --> 00:50:18,619
that you know you have to establish

1152
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:20,030
written procedures to document that this

1153
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:22,219
is for extraction that the closed loop

1154
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:23,510
extraction system is maintained in

1155
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:26,059
accordance with the equipment

1156
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:27,470
manufacturer specifications and ensure

1157
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:29,929
of routine verification that it's

1158
00:50:27,469 --> 00:50:32,809
operating correctly and continues to

1159
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:35,929
comply and you also have to develop SOPs

1160
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:39,139
and good manufacturing product practices

1161
00:50:35,929 --> 00:50:41,719
in a training plan prior to doing it

1162
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:45,230
like prior to producing the s tracks and

1163
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:47,059
any person using solvents or gases in a

1164
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:48,590
closed-loop system has to be fully

1165
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:50,900
trained on how to use the system and

1166
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:53,298
have direct access to the app

1167
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,619
workable safety data sheets so the

1168
00:50:53,298 --> 00:50:57,139
Department of Public Health was going

1169
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:59,599
into facilities and finding people who

1170
00:50:57,139 --> 00:51:01,670
got a manufacturing license and got a

1171
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,440
fancy machine and had no idea how to use

1172
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:05,389
it and didn't know you had to clean it

1173
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,789
and didn't know how to clean it and it

1174
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:10,190
never cleaned it so they were a little

1175
00:51:07,789 --> 00:51:13,130
disturbed so now they're asking for a

1176
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:16,400
lot more information under permissible

1177
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:18,289
extractions they added that co2 gas used

1178
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,858
for extraction has to be food grade and

1179
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:23,990
that you know volatile solvents that you

1180
00:51:21,858 --> 00:51:28,009
do you also have to use a closed-loop

1181
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:30,379
extraction system please and then they

1182
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:32,720
added a couple of things in prohibited

1183
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:34,730
products about thermally processed low

1184
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:37,429
acid cannabis products anybody know what

1185
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:38,690
that is thermally it's canned food

1186
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:41,598
that's what that is

1187
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:44,750
so canned food and acidified cannabis

1188
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,930
products is pickled food so that they're

1189
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:49,699
saying that anything of those things

1190
00:51:46,929 --> 00:51:51,169
my understanding of those terms you can

1191
00:51:49,699 --> 00:51:54,019
go to the Code of Federal Regulations

1192
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:56,180
and find your own solution but but

1193
00:51:54,019 --> 00:51:58,639
canned food pickled food it looks like

1194
00:51:56,179 --> 00:52:01,460
they're adding to the list of prohibited

1195
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:04,639
products there used to be you can't

1196
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:07,909
obviously add cannabis to fruit loops

1197
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:09,920
and make that available but they have

1198
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:12,889
added that you can put commercially

1199
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,630
available foods into candy or snack food

1200
00:52:12,889 --> 00:52:15,828
it as an ingredient but it has to be

1201
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:18,410
used in a way that renders it

1202
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:20,180
unrecognizable as that commercially

1203
00:52:18,409 --> 00:52:23,149
available item and you can't list it in

1204
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:30,828
the ingredients to say like M&amp;Ms isn't

1205
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:33,349
my stuff they so this is this is um this

1206
00:52:30,829 --> 00:52:35,180
is back to the kind of industrial hemp

1207
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:36,950
thing this is kind of what I call the

1208
00:52:35,179 --> 00:52:39,500
death toll for industrial hemp at this

1209
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:42,348
moment is that these three regulations

1210
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:44,239
so in the requirement for edibles it

1211
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:45,859
already had that except for cannabis

1212
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,108
cannabis concentrator terpenes no

1213
00:52:45,858 --> 00:52:50,298
ingredient can be used unless that

1214
00:52:48,108 --> 00:52:51,769
ingredient is permitted by the United

1215
00:52:50,298 --> 00:52:54,048
States Food and Drug Administration for

1216
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:57,019
use in food or food manufacturing and

1217
00:52:54,048 --> 00:52:59,630
also now has to be generally recognized

1218
00:52:57,019 --> 00:53:03,288
as safe under Section yadda-yadda-yadda

1219
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:04,610
so so for edibles that would mean non

1220
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:07,160
industrial hemp because it is

1221
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:10,700
not permitted by the United States Food

1222
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:12,649
and Drug Administration now they've also

1223
00:53:10,699 --> 00:53:15,829
added that it for topical cannabis

1224
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:17,809
products and concentrates they shall

1225
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:19,190
only contain well this was a can only

1226
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:21,380
contain ingredients permitted for

1227
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:23,659
cosmetic manufacturing and in in

1228
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,430
accordance with the title 21 Code of

1229
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:28,699
Federal Regulations guess what's not in

1230
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:31,730
there industrial hemp and then they

1231
00:53:28,699 --> 00:53:33,769
added now that a manufacturer licensee

1232
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:34,550
shall only use cannabinoid concentrates

1233
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:36,829
and extracts

1234
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:38,660
that are manufactured or processed from

1235
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:41,000
cannabis obtained from a licensed

1236
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:43,210
cannabis cultivator how many times could

1237
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,909
they use cannabis in the same sentence

1238
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:48,409
they that seems pretty specific that

1239
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:50,089
they're saying if you did not get that

1240
00:53:48,409 --> 00:53:51,409
cannabinoid and I don't know that we're

1241
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:54,530
gonna argue that CBD is in the

1242
00:53:51,409 --> 00:53:57,230
cannabinoid from a licensed cannabis

1243
00:53:54,530 --> 00:54:00,590
cultivator it is not supposed to be in a

1244
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:03,550
manufactured product they also have some

1245
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:05,539
stuff about like not lies Mac

1246
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:09,410
manufacturing preparing or packaging in

1247
00:54:05,539 --> 00:54:11,750
a food establishment or as a process

1248
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:13,190
food registrant and also not in a

1249
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,809
location that's licensed by the

1250
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:17,889
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control

1251
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:19,880
which feels like they're kind of

1252
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:22,940
pre-empting some of the coming

1253
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:24,530
consumption areas and you know somewhere

1254
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:27,470
like West Hollywood to be like just so

1255
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:32,420
you know you can't have your facility in

1256
00:54:27,469 --> 00:54:34,250
a bar or a restaurant there was some new

1257
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:36,230
definitions about tablets capsules and

1258
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:43,360
orally consumed concentrates which is a

1259
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:45,590
new category that got added they just to

1260
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,360
specify because obviously you can see a

1261
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:49,309
lot of people vying I remember that

1262
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:53,860
there's a there's a mint company that

1263
00:54:49,309 --> 00:54:57,079
was trying to call their mint a orally

1264
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:58,519
dissolving dehydrated tincture so that

1265
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:00,769
it could have the a thousand milligrams

1266
00:54:58,519 --> 00:55:02,599
limit so they created this orally

1267
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:04,519
consumed concentrate which is a

1268
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:07,639
concentrate intended to be consumed by

1269
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:09,440
your mouth and not otherwise edible so

1270
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:10,969
it can include tinctures capsules and

1271
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,860
tablets the line that they seem to be

1272
00:55:10,969 --> 00:55:14,389
drawing is it a capsule or a tablet is

1273
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:15,289
something that is intended to be

1274
00:55:14,389 --> 00:55:18,079
swallowed whole

1275
00:55:15,289 --> 00:55:20,690
you drink it like a like a Tylenol or a

1276
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,489
with some water there you go orally

1277
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:24,309
consume concentrate is more like a mint

1278
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:27,679
something that dissolves in the mouth

1279
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:29,779
and it has natural artificial flavors or

1280
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:31,309
sweeteners they're saying a tablet or a

1281
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:33,890
capsule under their definition doesn't

1282
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:35,449
have artificial flavors or sweeteners so

1283
00:55:33,889 --> 00:55:38,929
take a good look at those definitions

1284
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:41,989
because orally consumed concentrates max

1285
00:55:38,929 --> 00:55:46,069
out can be up to 500 milligrams of THC

1286
00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:48,049
per package but over 100 milligrams they

1287
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:52,309
have to be labeled for medical only and

1288
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:55,370
can only be sold to medical patients but

1289
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:57,889
a tablet that you swallow whole can be a

1290
00:55:55,369 --> 00:56:02,989
thousand milligrams it's makes total

1291
00:55:57,889 --> 00:56:05,750
sense across the board so the THC

1292
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:08,929
concentration limits that's what I'm

1293
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:11,510
saying in the 500 milligrams orally

1294
00:56:08,929 --> 00:56:14,089
consumed products containing alcohol was

1295
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:15,680
specified that's our tinctures those

1296
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:17,420
have to be in a container little no

1297
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:19,219
larger than two fluid ounces and have to

1298
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,450
have a calibrated dropper or a measuring

1299
00:56:19,219 --> 00:56:22,819
device that's kind of how they're

1300
00:56:20,449 --> 00:56:24,710
distinguishing a tincture from sneaking

1301
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:26,000
in an alcoholic beverage is that it has

1302
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:28,909
to have a little dropper and it has to

1303
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:35,059
be tight so you know like airplane booze

1304
00:56:28,909 --> 00:56:36,739
it's gonna be like that for track and

1305
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:39,320
trace system requirement this is the

1306
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:41,149
happiest thing in there I'm gonna say

1307
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:45,710
for manufacturers this brings me so much

1308
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:47,990
joy I can't even express it one of the

1309
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:49,909
things in the entire regulations the

1310
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:52,579
concept of research and development only

1311
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:54,710
existed in nursery the only people

1312
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:57,199
allowed to have anything for R&amp;D and one

1313
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:59,179
of the big questions was if you're a

1314
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:00,559
manufacturer developing a product and

1315
00:56:59,179 --> 00:57:01,940
you're trying out new things or new

1316
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,409
formulations and how do you know they

1317
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,429
work and what's going to happen and

1318
00:57:03,409 --> 00:57:06,649
maybe there's going to be some loss

1319
00:57:04,429 --> 00:57:09,559
there really was no accountability for

1320
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:12,110
that the CD pH has added this beautiful

1321
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:13,489
line that says one of the things that

1322
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:15,470
can be recorded in the track and trace

1323
00:57:13,489 --> 00:57:17,719
system within 24 hours is the use of

1324
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:20,209
cannabis or cannabis product for

1325
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:23,299
internal quality control testing or

1326
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:25,730
product research and development so the

1327
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,950
fact that they have acknowledged that

1328
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:31,490
that is a thing that exists is a

1329
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:35,389
beautiful beautiful thing indeed real

1330
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:37,789
quick for the CDFA the track and trace

1331
00:57:35,389 --> 00:57:40,159
requirements they did go to calendar

1332
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:41,989
days instead of business day so so a lot

1333
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:44,509
of these reporting requirements are like

1334
00:57:41,989 --> 00:57:46,519
when you have three calendar days to

1335
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:48,140
restore when connectivity goes down and

1336
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:50,570
you have to put in all your data you

1337
00:57:48,139 --> 00:57:53,839
have to report any change of disposition

1338
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:55,670
in three calendar days that's a long

1339
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,710
time especially if you're in the up

1340
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:59,360
north and you have to come down out of

1341
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:01,460
the mountain and get to internet you

1342
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,450
know reception and stuff it's gonna be a

1343
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,940
challenge

1344
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:07,069
meeting those calendar day requirements

1345
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:08,990
so just when you look at the regs be

1346
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:12,350
very very specific and and pay attention

1347
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:13,759
to win notifications any action is

1348
00:58:12,349 --> 00:58:15,019
requiring calendar days instead of

1349
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,720
business days

1350
00:58:15,019 --> 00:58:19,190
Josh touched on this there was some

1351
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:21,559
additions to the cultivation plan

1352
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:23,300
requirements there was clarifications on

1353
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:25,699
what can be shared and what can't

1354
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,740
so things that cannot be shared was like

1355
00:58:25,699 --> 00:58:29,719
immature plant areas processing areas

1356
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:32,449
packaging areas in that quarantine area

1357
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:37,039
he spoke of and then there was areas

1358
00:58:32,449 --> 00:58:39,409
that can be shared that that were

1359
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:41,989
enumerated he talked about the signed

1360
00:58:39,409 --> 00:58:44,029
attestation that states you're gonna do

1361
00:58:41,989 --> 00:58:45,769
the requirements for legal use of

1362
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:49,010
pesticides in Los Angeles for example

1363
00:58:45,769 --> 00:58:51,230
that requires getting a pesticide

1364
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:53,150
applicators license and an operator ID

1365
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:55,519
for your business so you have to contact

1366
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:58,849
your agricultural commissioner to know

1367
00:58:55,519 --> 00:59:02,750
what those requirements are I think much

1368
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:06,170
of this he covered the there was some

1369
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:09,380
new clarifications on cannabis waste a

1370
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:11,570
super bummer for outdoor growers is this

1371
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:13,280
line that stayed that outdoor licensees

1372
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:15,410
are prohibited from using light

1373
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,470
deprivation which means that they're

1374
00:59:15,409 --> 00:59:20,929
saying you can't even tent your plants

1375
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:24,139
if you wanted to use a non electrical

1376
00:59:20,929 --> 00:59:26,779
non light sense from the the best that I

1377
00:59:24,139 --> 00:59:29,108
can tell is this has to do I mean and

1378
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:31,700
that they consider this a moderate

1379
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:33,949
offense that can carry a fine I believe

1380
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:38,389
that one is like 500 to $1,000 per

1381
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:40,819
instance and then they determined that I

1382
00:59:38,389 --> 00:59:43,069
mean I I'm trying to get through the

1383
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:45,359
statement of reasons that part of that

1384
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:47,940
is that you know you'll get

1385
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:49,920
flowering cycles if you use that light

1386
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:52,259
deprivation technique and then they're

1387
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,900
trying to appropriately create scaled

1388
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:57,119
fees and the fee for an outdoor grow is

1389
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:59,009
less than the fee for a mix light grow

1390
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:01,318
so they want to take away that ability

1391
00:59:59,009 --> 01:00:03,028
for an outdoor grower to get multiple

1392
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:05,190
harvests it's pretty much what I'm

1393
01:00:03,028 --> 01:00:07,559
reading into that because if they did

1394
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:11,940
that then they'd want to pay higher fees

1395
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:13,499
if you're gonna yield more so this is

1396
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,420
the one I like to point out just as my

1397
01:00:13,498 --> 01:00:18,778
advertisement for why you need an

1398
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:20,579
amazing compliance team is that that

1399
01:00:18,778 --> 01:00:22,949
administrative action for record-keeping

1400
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:25,769
is up to a thirty thousand dollar fine

1401
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:27,598
per individual violation if your records

1402
01:00:25,768 --> 01:00:29,159
are not in shape that's just

1403
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:34,349
record-keeping there's a lot of other

1404
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:35,879
finds more fun things they change in the

1405
01:00:34,349 --> 01:00:37,650
BCC they change the definition of

1406
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,660
immature plant that held to anything

1407
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:41,009
over 18 inches so if you're a retailer

1408
01:00:39,659 --> 01:00:42,929
and you've got clones and they grow over

1409
01:00:41,009 --> 01:00:45,420
18 inches it's not an immature plant

1410
01:00:42,929 --> 01:00:48,239
anymore you can't sell it that does not

1411
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:50,249
go for the CDFA they have a different

1412
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:51,720
for cultivation there's a different

1413
01:00:50,248 --> 01:00:54,439
definition of a mature plant that

1414
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:56,759
doesn't impose that 18 inch line

1415
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:59,068
inventory reconciliation this was good

1416
01:00:56,759 --> 01:01:02,789
news changed from 14 days to 30 calendar

1417
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:03,838
days so now your your describes you

1418
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:06,390
don't have to do your reconciliation

1419
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:08,699
point but for every 30 days the

1420
01:01:06,389 --> 01:01:11,278
significant discrepancy definition went

1421
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:14,068
up a little bit to 3 percent of average

1422
01:01:11,278 --> 01:01:17,429
monthly sales instead of 2 there was

1423
01:01:14,068 --> 01:01:19,710
some clarity oh yeah this was about this

1424
01:01:17,429 --> 01:01:21,690
part did stay with the structures have

1425
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:24,028
to be permanently affixed to the land so

1426
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:26,519
you can't have like rolling you know

1427
01:01:24,028 --> 01:01:28,798
like RVs and stuff that you're using a

1428
01:01:26,518 --> 01:01:31,979
spaces or shipping containers have to be

1429
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:33,960
permanently affixed to the ground the

1430
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:36,539
there was some clarity around pre-rolls

1431
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,190
it's nice they've got specific that a

1432
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:40,109
licensed distributor can package and

1433
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:41,670
repackage and label and cannabis

1434
01:01:40,108 --> 01:01:43,949
including pre-rolls and that in

1435
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:45,509
manufacturing in addition to the

1436
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:48,598
activities a licensee can role in

1437
01:01:45,509 --> 01:01:49,380
package pre-rolls they did add the line

1438
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:51,599
though

1439
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:54,568
to clarify pre-rolls have to be rolled

1440
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:56,640
prior to compliance testing so you don't

1441
01:01:54,568 --> 01:01:58,139
test your bulk and then roll pre rolls

1442
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:58,960
and put them out you have to roll them

1443
01:01:58,139 --> 01:02:02,769
then test them

1444
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:04,690
then put them out yeah right well it's

1445
01:02:02,769 --> 01:02:06,880
you get it because we had it we had a

1446
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:08,289
big issue as people get bulk tested and

1447
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,610
then they mixed it with untested and

1448
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:13,119
then their pre-rolls didn't test right

1449
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:15,579
so until until we gained some trust in

1450
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,380
this relationship we're having it's

1451
01:02:15,579 --> 01:02:18,969
gonna take a minute and track and trace

1452
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:20,650
will help I mean it'll help with the

1453
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:22,329
visibility on those things where every

1454
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:26,019
component is tested and you can kind of

1455
01:02:22,329 --> 01:02:27,969
see it better one of the big is so

1456
01:02:26,019 --> 01:02:29,650
resampling was a big thing we had a big

1457
01:02:27,969 --> 01:02:31,779
issue and we continue to have issues

1458
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:33,789
with testing labs having issues it's so

1459
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:36,220
kind of one of those things that did

1460
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:38,259
they didn't see that coming that um what

1461
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:39,669
happens when a lab loses its license and

1462
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:41,410
they're sitting on all these samples and

1463
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:42,820
you're not allowed previously weren't

1464
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:44,529
allowed to transfer it and have somebody

1465
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:45,910
else sample it and test it so you're

1466
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:48,310
just sitting waiting for your product to

1467
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:49,949
be done and now they allow that if a

1468
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:52,210
licensed laboratory is unable to

1469
01:02:49,949 --> 01:02:54,730
competently complete the compliance

1470
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:58,750
testing after sampling you can contract

1471
01:02:54,730 --> 01:03:00,039
another lab to test your goods there was

1472
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:02,440
also the issue for a lot of

1473
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:05,529
manufacturers was that they removed this

1474
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:07,570
language about the plus or minus 10% it

1475
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:10,120
used to be for especially for edibles it

1476
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:12,850
was 100 milligrams per package plus or

1477
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,889
minus 10% and they and they took that

1478
01:03:12,849 --> 01:03:16,449
away which horrified many edible

1479
01:03:14,889 --> 01:03:18,039
companies because it meant that they

1480
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:20,109
would have to shoot for ninety percent

1481
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:22,630
so that all of their stuff would be like

1482
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:25,360
you know you know 90 milligrams of THC

1483
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:27,309
because they wouldn't want to go over

1484
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,559
the 100 threshold but that seems to have

1485
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:33,849
been corrected in the distribution

1486
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:36,610
section in 5307 point one where the

1487
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:38,529
distributor you can look at it for their

1488
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:40,780
Quality Assurance review any difference

1489
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:45,490
within plus or minus 10% is considered

1490
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:49,800
still okay so that's that okay I think I

1491
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:54,969
did it and Josh touched on the OSHA so

1492
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:58,000
so what so what now now what that's one

1493
01:03:54,969 --> 01:03:59,709
thing I have this is my little quick to

1494
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,179
do list because obviously there's a lot

1495
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:03,460
of things that weren't handled in the

1496
01:04:01,179 --> 01:04:05,079
regulatory process one of the most

1497
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:08,500
glaring ones is compassion and

1498
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:10,719
compassion programs Scott weiners going

1499
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,699
to reintroduce his compassion bill this

1500
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:14,828
year is anticipated which was SB 30

1501
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:17,078
for which was to allow for the donation

1502
01:04:14,829 --> 01:04:18,970
of cannabis products to medicinal

1503
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:21,039
cannabis patients without retailers

1504
01:04:18,969 --> 01:04:22,989
having to pay the full excise tax and

1505
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:25,900
the full taxes on those items so we're

1506
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:28,899
hoping that that goes this also kicks in

1507
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:33,099
the delayed feasibility study that the

1508
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:34,630
Bureau has to undertake under mikasa of

1509
01:04:33,099 --> 01:04:36,400
looking into the feasibility of a

1510
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:39,280
non-profit license type which would

1511
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:41,650
create another possible Avenue for the

1512
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:44,619
collective models for compassionate care

1513
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:47,289
for for businesses to be able to you

1514
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:48,940
know focus on the needs of patients in

1515
01:04:47,289 --> 01:04:52,119
the medicinal market without taking on

1516
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:57,789
the full you know necessarily fee

1517
01:04:52,119 --> 01:05:00,309
structure or tax structure of cannabis

1518
01:04:57,789 --> 01:05:02,710
commercial cannabis sovereign nations

1519
01:05:00,309 --> 01:05:04,570
was not solved at all in the regulations

1520
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:06,909
they still are like yeah waive all your

1521
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:09,430
sovereign rights and go for it

1522
01:05:06,909 --> 01:05:11,108
so I think there's still a lot of work

1523
01:05:09,429 --> 01:05:13,389
to be done in negotiating and figuring

1524
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:16,289
out how tribes can interplay and work

1525
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:21,279
with the commercial cannabis industry

1526
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:22,599
sampling is still just a ridiculous and

1527
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,280
sales process that was never

1528
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:26,769
contemplated by the industry of how

1529
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:29,829
products get to market and the fact that

1530
01:05:26,769 --> 01:05:32,230
you maybe need your distribution reps to

1531
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:33,970
have samples or be able to give it to

1532
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:35,740
people there's a still a lot of problems

1533
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:38,759
in that area that need to be solved that

1534
01:05:35,739 --> 01:05:41,559
the regulator's felt were out of their

1535
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:43,329
range of ability to deal with that stuff

1536
01:05:41,559 --> 01:05:45,159
because of the prohibition against free

1537
01:05:43,329 --> 01:05:50,500
products so it'll probably require a

1538
01:05:45,159 --> 01:05:52,328
bill or a new language the there's a tax

1539
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,530
bill that's going to be introduced some

1540
01:05:52,329 --> 01:05:55,210
people are thinking Lackey is going to

1541
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:57,670
reintroduce the excise tax bill to

1542
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:59,170
hopefully lower the excise tax because

1543
01:05:57,670 --> 01:05:59,740
obviously we all know taxes are out of

1544
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:01,809
control

1545
01:05:59,739 --> 01:06:03,669
banking is another huge problem and

1546
01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:06,818
Hertzberg is gonna reintroduce I think

1547
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:08,230
his banking bill to move towards the

1548
01:06:06,818 --> 01:06:11,500
creation of charter banks or some

1549
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:14,740
solution and then obviously just the

1550
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:17,679
glooming gloaming problem of pathways to

1551
01:06:14,739 --> 01:06:22,229
licensure they say 99 problems and local

1552
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:24,909
authorization is number one this that

1553
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:25,880
you know some of those questions are

1554
01:06:24,909 --> 01:06:28,519
starting to be contemplate

1555
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:31,670
how is this dual licensing system

1556
01:06:28,519 --> 01:06:33,440
working out with you know localities and

1557
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:35,389
them trying to get it together and those

1558
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:38,599
kind of complexities of not having those

1559
01:06:35,389 --> 01:06:43,429
things interface so that I think I did

1560
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:46,489
it I got through I did it so that's what

1561
01:06:43,429 --> 01:07:11,989
I have to say so obviously there's tons

1562
01:06:46,489 --> 01:07:14,569
more yeah yeah and I would also say no I

1563
01:07:11,989 --> 01:07:16,279
don't what Josh was saying is that there

1564
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:18,710
is nothing in the regulations about

1565
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:20,030
provisional licenses to explain how that

1566
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:22,610
system is going to work when it's going

1567
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:24,800
to start what you have to do all we have

1568
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:26,450
to go off of is the bill text so it's

1569
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:28,160
going to be critical to keep a close eye

1570
01:07:26,449 --> 01:07:29,960
on how they roll out their program

1571
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:31,849
they've been pretty mum about it even

1572
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:33,740
with the trade organizations and

1573
01:07:31,849 --> 01:07:35,420
lobbyists and all that stuff there's not

1574
01:07:33,739 --> 01:07:36,679
a lot of information mostly I think

1575
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,599
because they don't know cuz they just

1576
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:41,750
got passed as a bill and they're making

1577
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:43,579
it up so keep an eye on that and also I

1578
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:45,409
would say again keep an eye on what Josh

1579
01:07:43,579 --> 01:07:49,389
was saying about trying to get clarity

1580
01:07:45,409 --> 01:07:51,679
on how the agencies are interpreting

1581
01:07:49,389 --> 01:07:53,089
that how that provisional rollout is

1582
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:56,539
going to go in and when you're going to

1583
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:58,100
be obligated to submit your annual

1584
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:59,420
license because there seems to be some

1585
01:07:58,099 --> 01:08:02,690
different messaging from different

1586
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:04,099
agencies where the CDP H is saying oh

1587
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:06,260
you need to do it by the end of the year

1588
01:08:04,099 --> 01:08:08,900
and the CDFA is saying oh no you don't

1589
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:10,610
so there's a lot of chatter about those

1590
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:12,500
things so it's critical to kind of go

1591
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:15,440
get those answers in writing who like

1592
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:17,289
Josh was saying in the few seconds we

1593
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,890
have next if anybody has any questions

1594
01:08:17,289 --> 01:08:20,890
that's fine yeah

1595
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:04,529
not necessarily

1596
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:06,989
those would be things is there certain

1597
01:09:04,529 --> 01:09:08,969
limitations of like making sure that if

1598
01:09:06,988 --> 01:09:10,948
you can have unlimited brands but that

1599
01:09:08,969 --> 01:09:14,719
they're registered DBAs and they're

1600
01:09:10,948 --> 01:09:14,719
attached to the license number exactly

1601
01:09:15,859 --> 01:09:18,859
right

1602
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:38,100
yeah I mean it seems like there I

1603
01:09:35,789 --> 01:09:39,750
remember going in for an early like test

1604
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:42,329
of the licensing software and they only

1605
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:44,430
had about four product categories for

1606
01:09:42,329 --> 01:09:46,109
manufactured products so they've been

1607
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:47,970
expanding their understanding of what's

1608
01:09:46,109 --> 01:09:48,990
possible and what people are making and

1609
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:50,760
I don't think that there's any

1610
01:09:48,989 --> 01:09:52,199
limitation on products well you would

1611
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:54,960
have to look at though is if you are a

1612
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:56,849
licensed manufacturer they did add

1613
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,279
language in terms of notifications to

1614
01:09:56,850 --> 01:10:02,160
the CD pH where every time you create a

1615
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:04,079
new product a new formulation or release

1616
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:18,239
a new SKU you have to notify them an

1617
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:19,829
update yeah it doesn't have to be that I

1618
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:21,960
think that the main clarifications is a

1619
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:24,420
brand has to be attached to a licensed

1620
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:26,100
entity and in that attachment you're

1621
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,899
going to have to make a certain amount

1622
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:30,170
of disclosures and have things in in

1623
01:10:27,899 --> 01:10:30,170
place

1624
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:50,659
yep yeah I mean that's pretty much what

1625
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:53,420
the regulations give us is the new

1626
01:10:50,659 --> 01:10:55,189
roadmap of these are these are the rules

1627
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:57,560
as they understand them and now it's our

1628
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:59,809
job to find a way to navigate them and

1629
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,160
be creative which luckily is something

1630
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:21,680
that the cannabis industry has always

1631
01:11:01,159 --> 01:11:24,349
been really good at I would I would say

1632
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:26,360
a talk to an attorney because when

1633
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:29,870
that's why I think it's very important

1634
01:11:26,359 --> 01:11:32,839
to look at that definition of cannabis

1635
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:35,210
accessories the original definition from

1636
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:38,659
the health and safety code of marijuana

1637
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:40,250
accessories because in this would I tip

1638
01:11:38,659 --> 01:11:43,279
my hat to the lawyers in the room to

1639
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:45,590
read into that further but it describes

1640
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:48,439
a very exhaustive list of anything that

1641
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:50,930
helps you to consume prepare grow probs

1642
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:55,000
so so I would you know if I was a lawyer

1643
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:57,950
which I'm not I would say that cookbooks

1644
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,020
hell is is a method of figuring out how

1645
01:11:57,949 --> 01:12:01,369
I'm going to put cannabis into the human

1646
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:03,350
body which is exactly what that

1647
01:12:01,369 --> 01:12:05,300
definition is and learning how to grow

1648
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:08,870
cannabis is putting it into the human

1649
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:11,539
body so the the hair-splitting part that

1650
01:12:08,869 --> 01:12:13,970
it will be is if the agencies are going

1651
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:17,029
to be psychotic enough and I put nothing

1652
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:19,010
past them to say that any book cookbook

1653
01:12:17,029 --> 01:12:20,840
blah blah blah in a dispensary has to be

1654
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:22,430
by a licensed company and brand blah

1655
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:25,220
blah blah I don't see that happening I

1656
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:26,869
see it as an ancillary product just like

1657
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:29,720
you don't have to be a licensed cannabis

1658
01:12:26,869 --> 01:12:32,300
company right now to make a cannabis

1659
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:34,130
accessory and I believe that those fall

1660
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:38,020
under the definition of cannabis

1661
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:38,020
accessory but ask your lawyer

1662
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:51,089
branded by a licensee well I mean that

1663
01:12:45,149 --> 01:12:52,710
would be yeah I mean that would be that

1664
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:56,579
would be the solution if they're gonna

1665
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:57,840
split hairs but I'd my suggestion has

1666
01:12:56,579 --> 01:12:59,698
these would be things that we need to go

1667
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,779
to the agencies after they're done with

1668
01:12:59,698 --> 01:13:05,389
their Christmas break because they're

1669
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:07,380
like don't ask any questions until after

1670
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:09,660
that that we'd want to get further

1671
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:12,719
clarification to see are they seriously

1672
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:14,698
taking it that far or under the I would

1673
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,439
argue that under the definition of

1674
01:13:14,698 --> 01:13:18,509
cannabis accessory and how extensive

1675
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:21,509
that definition is in the health and

1676
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:24,600
safety code that the cookbook wouldn't

1677
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:26,690
fall under that thank you so much

1678
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:32,940
everybody thank you

1679
01:13:26,689 --> 01:13:32,939
[Applause]
