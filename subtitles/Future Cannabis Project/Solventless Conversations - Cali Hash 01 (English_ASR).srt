[Music]

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:14,190
it's really smoking and pietÃ  and

3
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:15,689
installing and this is traditionally how

4
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:20,368
they smoking really how they smoke it or

5
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:21,509
just means like this like this well it's

6
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:23,129
also when you're sharing it so

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,269
everyone's not limping it you know

8
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:27,439
that's actually the right way to do it

9
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:27,439
if it's Janet do you have wipes

10
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:43,140
yeah this is how people been smoking

11
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:45,328
hash forever right Nepal in Morocco this

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,210
though the Chilam yeah in fact I don't

13
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,200
smoke anything out of stone yeah and

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,549
this one's made from stone the

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,140
traditional ones are all stone I smelled

16
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:54,000
this one on a regular myself and I'll

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,140
just i basically buy one every two days

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,429
and just throw it when it looks dirty

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,270
but the problem with these ones is it

20
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:01,710
looks like you're taking other stuff it

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,180
makes you look a little bit dirty you

22
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:12,930
know so this one I don't know and even

23
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:17,188
now taking it out once again sturdy like

24
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:20,430
yeah - come on 31 awake yeah sketchy

25
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:22,469
that's where the Paki puffs come the

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:35,060
puffs go peak is so nice makes you look

27
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:35,060
less dodgy medium production

28
00:01:35,140 --> 00:02:03,158
I like what you posted this boarded with

29
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:08,289
some rosin I think the little jars was a

30
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:09,610
repose okay still it look good yeah to

31
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:11,079
see if you like that yeah sorry I didn't

32
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,700
do like a bit and then cup it and then

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:23,500
you just climb out of there exactly let

34
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:25,079
me light it for you going the holds the

35
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,370
whole crucial thing with the Chilam is

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:53,590
once you get a cherried let me get a

37
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:55,090
cherry for you uh-huh yeah you hold when

38
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,620
you get this perfect you cherry some of

39
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:01,090
it and then it just burned and you pass

40
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:03,299
it and yeah maybe the cherries nice Hong

41
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,229
bong - yeah exactly

42
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:07,060
anytime you can hash it I can cherry

43
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:13,359
some hash use a little tiny cup long up

44
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:15,069
there what I what I got was good though

45
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,930
like it's like as I tried doing that to

46
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,479
my hash like I have to make it bubble

47
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,849
smash it and and try to like smoke it

48
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,560
like that does it takes the same as you

49
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:29,049
if I were to dab it make rosin out of it

50
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:31,479
and dab it yeah yeah toy different

51
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:33,129
it's crazy what just that well heat and

52
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,959
pressure can do yeah I've been doing

53
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:37,030
this for like fucking almost 20 years

54
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,159
like making ash and or selling it for 20

55
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,650
plus and making it for probably 15 solid

56
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:44,318
and it's still a mystery

57
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:47,349
yeah there is always an artisanal aspect

58
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,969
always any professional hash person

59
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:50,889
whether it's Frenchie or anyone else

60
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:53,500
yeah I'll tell you the same thing it's

61
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:55,869
artisanal and that's the beauty and the

62
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,878
and some of the challenges because from

63
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,400
a commercial perspective it's very hard

64
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:04,030
to scale yeah it's all about small

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,620
batches with butane and distillate

66
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,870
you're just making fuckin you know you

67
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,680
know here's the thing I find interesting

68
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,719
like Frenchie talks about you know he

69
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,280
wants to find the best and then once

70
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,738
there's no longer the best source

71
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,639
material he's like tap I tap out I'm

72
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:25,598
done now you have 50 French cheese like

73
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:27,639
you guys and Asha and you know now

74
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:31,348
cookies and it's kind of like embark me

75
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:35,529
at some point the best

76
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:37,389
resin heads or trichome heads are not

77
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:39,939
going to be available so what do you do

78
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:42,329
do you create like a tier 2 product

79
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:45,579
almost like the ground crew and then the

80
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:47,199
the like the ultra premium that's more

81
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:48,699
expensive and then well I mean

82
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,099
personally my approach has always been a

83
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:53,360
little

84
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:55,670
more less philosophical and more numbers

85
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,100
based more of a business especially in

86
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,170
the 64 market you know we've built this

87
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:05,780
thing out in the last two years from the

88
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:09,590
advent of 2016 and we were very much

89
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:11,809
keen on getting the price point to an

90
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:16,250
affordable level and I love Frenchy to

91
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:20,060
bits but charging $60 retail for a gram

92
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:22,009
of good hash that's 65% total

93
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,680
cannabinoid in my opinion is a little

94
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:26,329
bit high so whore whole our whole

95
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,889
philosophy at Kelly Ashton nausia is

96
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:30,319
also they've just recently lowered their

97
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:33,110
prices is to really try to find a price

98
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,599
point and a quality point that not only

99
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,120
resembles the traditional hash that

100
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:44,180
everybody loves but is also you know

101
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:47,899
under $35 I guess more affordable the

102
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,879
rosin guys are doing and our and our

103
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:52,669
approach from the beginning was to start

104
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:55,730
off with that in mind but by all means

105
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:57,470
we have in the in the pipeline you know

106
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,970
a fresh frozen line that'll be our

107
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,820
premium line and essentially it comes

108
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,620
back as it comes down to total

109
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:06,980
cannabinoid percentages

110
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,500
now with cured material it's basically

111
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:14,270
impossible in my experience and opinion

112
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,529
to get anything above 70 72 percent

113
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:16,789
total cannabinoids and if you're getting

114
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:18,289
70 you're doing great because the

115
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,939
average is probably for the cold water

116
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,030
action yeah for cold water hash that's

117
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:24,379
not live resin that's fresh no it's just

118
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:25,549
a whole different process of different

119
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:26,810
it's a different product because it's

120
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,000
didn't part of curing process and you

121
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,579
get a different end result to get this

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,709
what is considered you know the most

123
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:36,349
closest representation to traditional

124
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:39,889
hash and what we're smoking on today you

125
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:42,020
have to use the cured product so hath

126
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,909
music you have to yeah and we do make

127
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:45,859
live product but it comes out so

128
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,320
different and that stuff you run lighter

129
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,580
in color it's much lighter it's closer

130
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,139
to a blonde like you know how

131
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:53,089
traditional hash you'll have three

132
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:54,709
different three main different types

133
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:57,859
you'll have a blonde / red and you have

134
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:59,930
a black and all that really are red yeah

135
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,900
Albany's all that really is is different

136
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,389
points

137
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:04,739
when the trichome is in development

138
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:09,139
that's all that that's all that really

139
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,910
is it speaks to the level of oxidization

140
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,650
I love it man that's a whole nother

141
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,240
Hache world though yeah so we're

142
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:17,219
definitely original Hache world I guess

143
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,788
right yeah first generation but let's be

144
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,440
clear we're not exactly doing hash like

145
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:25,469
they did it traditionally traditionally

146
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:27,149
it was a dry sip product and let's going

147
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,250
back to cannabinoid percentages none of

148
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:31,439
that would go higher than 35 40 percent

149
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,788
now what was it so just quickly you grew

150
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,139
up in Spain yes sir

151
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:41,399
so when did you first have ice-water

152
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:44,100
hash until I went to Amsterdam in my

153
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:47,299
late teens so when I saw later Bach

154
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:50,820
ballpark what year was 1999 okay and

155
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,199
before that it was all dry saved yeah

156
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,300
generally I mean not generally

157
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,389
exclusively at that time for Morocco you

158
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,280
were only getting very high-end pressed

159
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:01,199
dry set that's more the traditional

160
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,769
that's how they've made it forever in

161
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,629
Morocco you're also more likely to have

162
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:08,370
foreign object get into a dry sand right

163
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:11,418
and you are with the cold waters there's

164
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,418
a lot of foreign objects

165
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:19,319
is there still a market for dry stuff

166
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:21,719
like is there some appreciation like do

167
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,139
you absolutely I mean he can speak to it

168
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,909
as well because we operate in we

169
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,560
operated it extensively in the

170
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:32,038
traditional space and when I say that

171
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,679
I'm referring to the to15 medical space

172
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:38,668
so not the recreational sense you know

173
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:40,649
post 2016 space so working in that space

174
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:42,750
I got to learn that there still is a lot

175
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:46,079
of demand for these products like a very

176
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:49,379
specific replication of what people had

177
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,389
before is always wanted and now it's not

178
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:53,789
your average young American no way it's

179
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:55,500
your imported Saudi or your older hippie

180
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:57,899
you know so it's a certain demographic

181
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,269
without a doubt and it's a big bug yeah

182
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:02,458
I mean and again this is all niche niche

183
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,649
level products I mean we work with BDS

184
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:07,769
analytics and really the cold water

185
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:10,620
presses is representing 1.2 1.3 percent

186
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:12,958
of the market I mean it is small but is

187
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,399
it trending like exponential we would

188
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,349
like to believe so and

189
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,750
I mean and not only that our mission in

190
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,820
Cali hash is to do that and to educate

191
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,799
and to bring it back to the masses I

192
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,110
mean the reality of cold water extract

193
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,059
and it's most you know stepping back

194
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,919
from all this and its most philosophical

195
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,799
sense and it's and like what makes it

196
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,569
different why is it better all of the

197
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,639
other extractions and when I say that

198
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:40,650
I'm referring to butane hexane propane

199
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:42,809
ethanol rosin even they're all using

200
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:45,419
high pressure or high heat or a

201
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:47,339
combination of both and when you're

202
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:49,229
doing that you actually change the size

203
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,879
and the shape of the molecule and like

204
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,529
we know this because in our lab we

205
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,600
produce all of it we produce distillate

206
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:55,829
and a lot of things and we'll take all

207
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,690
these different products like co2

208
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,280
extraction and distillate and we'll put

209
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,350
it under the microscope and we look and

210
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,209
the molecules are very different they're

211
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,980
very long and they're jagged and they

212
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,930
essentially change completely now you

213
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,850
take a cold water hash product any cold

214
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:10,649
water hash product from bottom to bottom

215
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,420
from top to bottom and including dry

216
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:14,129
safe products and what you have when you

217
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,409
look under a microscope is a bunch of

218
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:17,549
really smiling trichomes that just

219
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:20,819
looked like they were on the plant but

220
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:22,019
it's collected together exactly so you

221
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,360
know and that's where I always go back

222
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,069
to in my entire career my entire you

223
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,500
know involvement in this industry is

224
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:31,560
based on that fact that you know the

225
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,840
best extract that represents the

226
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,509
original profile of the original plant

227
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,950
is Coldwater extract you know you're

228
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:39,629
getting rid of the chlorophyll and

229
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,030
you're retaining some of the plant

230
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:43,919
material and in my hip enos I still

231
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:45,240
believe some of those phytoplankton and

232
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,679
those little things in the plant

233
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,529
material I believe they're still they're

234
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,789
still important you know so yeah I mean

235
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:53,069
and going back to the original question

236
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:54,929
we are developing premium lines and

237
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,760
rasen lines because of course we want to

238
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:58,559
access those markets because there are

239
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,299
the younger demographic your average you

240
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,969
know 20 to 30 year old in America today

241
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:07,859
is daddy and exclusive rice so you know

242
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:09,840
well so within ice water

243
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,509
I almost want to call you a traditional

244
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:16,139
list Yeah right like their product is

245
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:20,189
obsolete ample balls don't not rosin jam

246
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:21,600
now so what what's your kind of so it

247
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,220
was two-part because of course I'm

248
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,440
passionate about this product because of

249
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,009
my involvement in in my life and my

250
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,420
childhood anyway

251
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:31,698
let's do that can we get the quasar

252
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:35,240
going fuck yeah all right join so first

253
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:38,389
of all let's talk about whatever first

254
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,339
thoughts on the quiz oh so I love the

255
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:42,230
look of it sleek look yeah I mean I've

256
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:43,910
seen it in videos but seeing it in

257
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,009
person just really brings it to life and

258
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:48,639
then mostly I mean it's just the

259
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:51,470
manufacturing of it is really impeccable

260
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,970
spot-on oh I see gang of the hash inside

261
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,680
the glass yeah we've already placed the

262
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,310
hash in there and this is lava cake

263
00:11:54,679 --> 00:12:02,750
which is a derivative of wedding cake

264
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:04,189
that is this hash here usually what

265
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,139
you're supposed to do with the coal is

266
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:10,449
you're supposed to heat it away from it

267
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:10,448
yeah we don't really have anything

268
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:17,838
Studios half built it's been a long time

269
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:21,889
since I smoked - ca' used to do a while

270
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,720
I was a little hyped back in my 2008 I

271
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:25,310
just never smelled the quasar before but

272
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,300
I've smoked a bunch of times especially

273
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:31,099
when I was younger insane I smoked hash

274
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:34,039
mixed in with the actual hookah tobacco

275
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:37,610
yeah we tried that is fantastic I mean

276
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:39,469
it lasts for four hours and I mean yeah

277
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,539
as long as you enjoy tobacco it is

278
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,129
killer always a good one in the party

279
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:44,599
scene and then you put levels of hash in

280
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,269
it so it's like different times you have

281
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,259
like really big head yeah it's fantastic

282
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:49,519
that'd be kind of coldest to be sitting

283
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:50,689
around well that was some of the things

284
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,310
we did in high school when we were kids

285
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,079
we you know we'd hang out at my house in

286
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:58,338
the roof and we'd just stash all night

287
00:12:54,078 --> 00:13:00,259
long and smoke the hookah was that's

288
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:03,319
kind of what I want to get going in here

289
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:06,019
is like having a hookah out all the time

290
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:08,929
where it's like it's so communal and I

291
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:11,539
so for me one of the big things is there

292
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:13,729
are people who appreciate hash how do

293
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:15,769
you introduce it to your average person

294
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,389
who's like how the fuck am I supposed

295
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:19,129
what am I supposed to do with it this is

296
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:25,519
the challenge of my entire marketing

297
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:26,838
team yeah and part of its the way you

298
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,568
know he can answer it very well because

299
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:33,139
Jo's in charge of our P ad team and part

300
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:35,389
of the answer is what he is it's a it's

301
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:37,460
a carryover from the traditional medical

302
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:39,919
market it stands for

303
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,980
oh yeah now they call them different

304
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:45,259
things but demos but I mean you almost

305
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,960
need like a guerilla marketing ground

306
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:50,210
and do like Frenchie cannoli every event

307
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,190
he has is hookah he has like the foot

308
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,230
like the octopus arms going yeah

309
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,690
everyone's mouth and he's like yeah

310
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,700
that's French he heavy right oh and he's

311
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,680
done great things for hash in America I

312
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,330
mean I don't know if I it's also

313
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:05,689
specific demographic to use it with a

314
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:07,639
hooker too but yeah friend she's done

315
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,680
amazing things and yeah I commend him

316
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,929
for his not only his teaching because

317
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,120
that's what he merrily does is his

318
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:15,949
classes and I love that you know sharing

319
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,179
the knowledge and not only by sharing

320
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,910
the knowledge you get these passionate

321
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:21,439
little little pools of people and little

322
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:23,299
networks of people that are I mean

323
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,330
there's a more and more people into the

324
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:27,139
hash products in America I believe it

325
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,520
especially my barely smoked flour

326
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:30,230
nowadays yeah

327
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,389
like I'm still recovering from Monday

328
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:35,570
night at the history of rosin I know you

329
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:38,000
guys like Spaniards right you roll

330
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,528
spliffs yeah right yeah I'm still

331
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,070
recovering from that I'm used to just

332
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:45,049
pure spliff expanded was in the room and

333
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,209
I and I was all stressed out because the

334
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:50,240
venue like tobacco is like there like

335
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:51,889
that yeah

336
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,870
I can't tell you the time they go to

337
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:55,309
parties and like if you light a

338
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,259
cigarette they're literally asking to

339
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:59,149
leave but if you light a joint 20 people

340
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:05,990
come to you it wasn't always like that

341
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:07,579
no it is also all right is it the coal

342
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:11,810
that's not we have is this the coal we

343
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:14,959
bought Chuck no okay but it kind of fits

344
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:17,509
the quasar nicely in Carmichael picture

345
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,669
the little sparks the flames what yeah

346
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:26,750
normally this would hopefully rogon's

347
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:31,240
not like super flammable so bit all

348
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:33,679
right so you move from Spain to likes

349
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,959
what what was your journey like Spain

350
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,889
yeah so I grew up in Spain I was born in

351
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,409
New York originally

352
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:40,909
I moved very young to Spain cuz that's

353
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:43,250
one of my father's from and where in

354
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:45,019
Spain we started in Madrid okay

355
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,139
my family's originally from the south of

356
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:49,149
Spain know from Critias I have like a

357
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:51,009
long heritage

358
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:54,250
but um but yeah I moved there when I was

359
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:55,990
quite young in the 90s went to you know

360
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,970
middle school in high school there and

361
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,430
then at the end of high school because I

362
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,290
was a native English speaker and I

363
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:03,929
wanted to get better at English and and

364
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:06,189
learning English then I moved to London

365
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:07,509
and I spent ten years in London I

366
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,250
studied in London for five and a half

367
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:11,980
years I did a philosophy degree and a

368
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,169
couple other courses and then I worked

369
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,360
for three three or four years there and

370
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:17,709
ii ended in the production thing and

371
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,360
then also i was in financial services

372
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,670
for two years I tend to be a broker

373
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,320
right out of the university though it

374
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:25,149
was just not for me I mean I was good at

375
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,890
it it just wasn't hey you try to have it

376
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:28,778
I tried it it was this insipid there was

377
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:30,220
no like creativity involved and I'm a

378
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:33,789
creative person so are you always

379
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,350
dabbling in hash oh yeah I mean I can

380
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:37,389
admit it now but during that time I was

381
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:41,230
imported from Spain and selling it on

382
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:44,769
the side so yeah in London in London so

383
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:48,430
talk before 2001 and for 9/11 and after

384
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:50,110
that I got tricky and this was all Marat

385
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:52,750
like where where was it coming from

386
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,580
wrong my contacts from Madrid they're

387
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,830
all I growing up in Madrid

388
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,870
I ended up becoming very close to my

389
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,520
dealers and they were all Moroccan and

390
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,560
you know I'm proud to call some of them

391
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,990
my good friends today and one in

392
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,818
particular goosey shoutout to goosey he

393
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,439
he was the one he would he was our main

394
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,509
supplier but yeah I mean these guys were

395
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,579
bringing in you know vast amounts it was

396
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:15,429
always in 200 grand bars so akela was

397
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:18,039
five bars and what's the current market

398
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:19,780
for the Moroccan hash is it just done or

399
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:21,609
you know I mean in Europe it's though

400
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:23,259
there yeah in Spain it's you know it's

401
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:25,509
getting a lot of competition now because

402
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:27,068
Spain is liberalizing and people are

403
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:29,470
allowed to grow personal amounts and

404
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:34,178
that allows other people to roam but but

405
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:35,620
so in let's say the Barcelona are they

406
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,269
coffee shot what do you call them in

407
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:38,678
bars collectives they call them still

408
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:41,079
because they're members they're member

409
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,960
member clubs member clubs I guess sounds

410
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:46,569
more like it's more like California

411
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,308
circa 2000 right if you want to try and

412
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:50,529
compare to something and it was before

413
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:57,009
2007 when we got everything more sorted

414
00:17:50,529 --> 00:18:01,539
out but so if you hit kind of any club

415
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:02,740
in Barcelona in the hash space and

416
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,288
actually in the flowers

417
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,870
- like what what what's trending up and

418
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:09,849
down like Morocco no I know but like

419
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:12,308
it's California weed in the in this fan

420
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:14,798
absolutely and not weed but genetics so

421
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:17,889
now the Moroccan growers and I know some

422
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,778
of these people they've all transferred

423
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,429
they've stopped growing their original

424
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:22,569
strains and the original genetics and

425
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:24,399
they're now all growing things that you

426
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:26,200
and I would know very well you know if

427
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:28,959
you go to Morocco now you you go to the

428
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,929
rift mouth and walkers it's skittles OG

429
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,149
I mean cookies I mean they really are

430
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:36,038
getting lemon cush they're getting stuff

431
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:37,599
so getting California genetics and

432
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:40,658
they're getting a lot of Amsterdam

433
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:44,288
genetics so you know but grown in Spain

434
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:46,390
no no this is all grown in Morocco the

435
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:49,750
Moroccan and the Moroccan industry in

436
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:53,950
Morocco is now shifting from try sift to

437
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:58,000
making proper bubble hash with ice and

438
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:00,429
that was another conversation and they

439
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,259
have to compete on their market has

440
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:04,840
always been Europe and it's a big market

441
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:08,648
for them I mean all of Amsterdam's hash

442
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:10,839
comes from Morocco and they've been the

443
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:13,808
dominant the dominant supplier for you

444
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:14,980
know at least 70 80 years now so and

445
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:16,990
there's still a market though for the

446
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,669
traditional Moroccan hash yes yeah I

447
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:22,899
mean I know for a fact right now you can

448
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:25,330
buy in London off the street else 1/8 of

449
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:28,599
hash Moroccan hash your normal average

450
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:31,139
hash for 20 pounds so it's actually

451
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:34,629
cheap much cheaper than it is here

452
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:37,149
you know the illegal market is is is so

453
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:39,370
established in Europe that the hash is

454
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:43,689
literally in every city and those

455
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:46,629
distribution channels are so varied and

456
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:48,100
you know and you know it's a little bit

457
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,659
old-school compared to over here as well

458
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:51,398
you know people there's still a lot half

459
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:53,590
of all of Spain's economy is under the

460
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:57,129
table I can say the same for Greece and

461
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:58,658
Italy and those are the California and

462
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,100
those are the entry points for in our

463
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:02,460
industry but those are the entry points

464
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:05,168
for for all the products so yeah I mean

465
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,890
to answer your question things are

466
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:07,538
changing

467
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,880
they're having to compete much more with

468
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:11,679
locally produced source material from

469
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,940
Spain but there's still a vast market

470
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,889
for Morocco and they're having to

471
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,940
compete so they're changing well what

472
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:18,069
what is what's in

473
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,080
testing to me as you also said that so

474
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:23,220
maraca you think traditionally like

475
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:25,839
their land race genetics there now like

476
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,569
California genetics like let's yeah

477
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:31,230
which is almost kind of we happen to you

478
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:33,428
know not in a way a lot of the very

479
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,139
affluent people that were in that

480
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:36,639
industry in Morocco they would send

481
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:39,038
their children for school because they

482
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:40,569
had money to Spain and some of the

483
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,919
people I went to school with happened to

484
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:43,808
be the children of some of the people

485
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,340
growing this product and in the Rif

486
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:47,048
mountains in Morocco so I actually have

487
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:49,178
gone there I've seen all this shit and I

488
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:51,668
mean and I and I'm in contact with some

489
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:52,750
of these people to this day so I'm fully

490
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,370
aware and they are they're getting

491
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,960
genetic some from us here and they're

492
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:57,489
getting genetics from Amsterdam and

493
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,500
they're understanding the new market and

494
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,359
they're consulting with me and why I

495
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,538
can't remember what was Morocco or

496
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:07,089
Lebanon but a do was talking about how

497
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:09,250
they like they grow in the land but then

498
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:11,709
they're also using salts like salt based

499
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,038
fertilizers which kind of destroys the

500
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:18,220
soil and so instead of having that

501
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:26,528
living soil it's non probiotic exactly

502
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:28,089
no and and it's almost unrecoverable if

503
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:30,069
you test your average Moroccan hashish

504
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:32,319
you'll find every contaminant and they

505
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:33,778
have I mean recently they did a study

506
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:37,569
and they tested I don't know how many

507
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:39,460
street-level hash from Madrid 80

508
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:42,220
something percent came back positive for

509
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,870
feces I think over eighty percent came

510
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,519
positives for for pesticides

511
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,500
it's the way they smuggle it that's how

512
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,339
to get the feces and then the way they

513
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,190
grow it that's how they get the

514
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:53,109
pesticides I mean it's extremely dirty

515
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,730
extremely bad for you luckily you're

516
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:56,229
smoking it so you're combusting some of

517
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,610
the badness away but if you're gonna

518
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,009
make edibles out of that stuff you'd

519
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:01,148
probably will get very sick I mean when

520
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:03,220
we were kids we didn't actually make

521
00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:07,058
edibles but if we had we probably would

522
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:08,889
have gotten very sick yeah yeah cuz the

523
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:10,388
way they smuggle it is they make little

524
00:22:08,888 --> 00:22:11,949
bail pass we call them bailed us in

525
00:22:10,388 --> 00:22:14,648
Spain these little eggs and they

526
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,659
swallowed them so they later than they

527
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:18,398
excrete them later but you know they

528
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:20,559
stink I mean even once you take all the

529
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:21,278
plastic off and I remember as a kid we

530
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:23,558
were in the plaza

531
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:25,179
know and you'd smell any be like is it

532
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:27,548
good and you see how shitty the smell of

533
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,370
it and then literally I'm not kidding it

534
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:30,470
smelled

535
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:35,808
is that it is that bad I hate to play I

536
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:37,430
got some fire so you know luckily things

537
00:22:35,808 --> 00:22:38,660
were changing luckily legalization

538
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,370
brings a whole new environment of

539
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,840
transparency where we can know what the

540
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:43,699
hell's in the product I mean right here

541
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,589
you can look at this you know all of

542
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,180
this is tested for 500 different

543
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:50,019
contaminants you know you have your

544
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:54,590
total profile of cannabinoids you have

545
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:56,210
herbicide oh yeah I mean even me now I

546
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:57,949
have a hard time smoking anything that's

547
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,799
not tested because I'm so scared because

548
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,840
I realize how much bad things we were

549
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:06,109
consuming I mean the vape epidemic right

550
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:09,319
now is a perfect example of it do you

551
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:13,129
guys have your own cultivation No so we

552
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:16,750
use we're exclusively sourcing all of

553
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:21,470
our biomass from three different major

554
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:23,710
producers Wonderbread i project cannabis

555
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:26,150
which is I don't know if you know them

556
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,769
they're also triple seven I have a bunch

557
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:31,040
of brands but project cannabis is like

558
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:35,629
the rule that's their retail name and

559
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:38,329
then and then uh yeah headwaters okay so

560
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,710
Wonder Bread is indoor in the valley is

561
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:42,409
everything indoor everything's indoor

562
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,450
okay we had bad luck because I'm

563
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:46,820
actually a proponent of fresh outdoor

564
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,429
this is where I'm going I love it I love

565
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:50,960
it I love it I love it my issue is and I

566
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:53,900
make some of my best material in the

567
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,670
north to this day and with that exact

568
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:59,780
material meaning like up in Emerald

569
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:01,429
triangle yes yeah I mean I've been

570
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:04,670
working exclusively with a guy who's in

571
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:06,440
his 50s and he is I mean talk about a

572
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,240
hash Master I think he could even you

573
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,789
know Eclipse our friend Frenchy in terms

574
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,240
of volume I mean I know for a fact he's

575
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:16,099
produced you know he's cool the bidding

576
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,569
is down he's growing his own no no he

577
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:19,939
went to school there he has access to

578
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:23,240
the market in general and anyway I was

579
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,890
segue in but point is yeah you get a

580
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,730
completely different product when you're

581
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:30,890
using outdoor as opposed to yeah and you

582
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:33,230
the really good stuff comes from really

583
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,590
good outdoor I've been told specifically

584
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,839
like light tap like that you get more

585
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:40,269
containment of the environment more

586
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,519
control but you still use that Sun yep

587
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:44,069
and I have I haven't had any outdoor

588
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,629
actually I do have some in the freezer

589
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:48,668
powers not on yet though we have vacua

590
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,960
shion's out down there yeah hopefully

591
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:52,509
it's okay a lot of people lost power

592
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:57,538
today up north as well there's a lot of

593
00:24:52,509 --> 00:25:03,819
Oh tell me your sucks yeah and the fires

594
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:06,400
yeah yeah I'm a proponent of sun-grown

595
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:08,019
now again when you're in making some of

596
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,000
the other stuff like when you're trying

597
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:13,329
to make non-traditional house when

598
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,390
they're trying to make you know your

599
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:18,730
rosin grade or your premium grade I like

600
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,230
to use indoor I prefer it now why were

601
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,028
using indoor and the south is because

602
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:24,730
that is the most accessible product and

603
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:25,929
it's and it's usually cleaner you know

604
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,429
we're having so we had some problems

605
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:30,700
with some of the source material coming

606
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:32,259
from some of these new Gardens because a

607
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,860
lot of these new Gardens in Santa

608
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:38,798
Barbara and you know in the greenhouses

609
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:41,079
they're retrofitted old farms so a lot

610
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:43,690
of them yeah we were in a cut flower

611
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:46,449
I was in Carpinteria yeah there's a lot

612
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,548
of dirt times in Carpinteria where you

613
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:51,548
know when people are growing cut flowers

614
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:52,569
like pesticides are everywhere yeah

615
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:54,158
exactly

616
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:56,079
because flowers you don't eat them right

617
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,880
so anything that was involved with

618
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,648
flowers you're right hey don't even go

619
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,000
near there you know take 20 years to get

620
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:03,069
the heavy metals out of the ground and

621
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,269
for me was the pesticides at first but

622
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:06,220
now it's the heavy metals that have

623
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:07,960
really common you know because we're

624
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,460
finding that when you're concentrating

625
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,440
and if you even have a little bit of

626
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,308
heavy metals in the source material when

627
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,600
you're concentrating you're

628
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:16,178
concentrating than either metals as well

629
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,709
and I mean and especially in California

630
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:20,080
California is by far the strictest

631
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:22,210
cannabis test yeah yeah it's not even

632
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,609
and to be clear let's make this a point

633
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:27,038
I mean we are testing every single unit

634
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:32,469
we're not like other states where they

635
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:34,720
can just test bulk you know a canned

636
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,640
stuff and then they take and they use an

637
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,440
algorithm to pick from the path from the

638
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,788
whole you know we'll give them two

639
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,659
thousand at a time and they'll have an

640
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:45,429
algorithm to pick we know the number

641
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:47,049
112-200 to make sure it's an appropriate

642
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:48,600
representation of the population and

643
00:26:47,048 --> 00:26:50,819
they'll test 15 in the

644
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,769
units to make sure yeah and I mean

645
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:55,200
anything that fills gets immediately

646
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:57,388
confiscated by the BCC and it's

647
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,798
destroyed and you have to pay for it to

648
00:26:57,388 --> 00:27:03,750
be destroyed yeah when we learned so

649
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:06,359
that's partly why we've now we were

650
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:10,980
trying to reduce those sort of issues

651
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:13,199
and working exclusively with with with

652
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,380
lice not just licensed always licensed

653
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,649
but with more reputable biomass

654
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,960
producers yeah and then we don't use

655
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:24,268
much you know if you compare us to you

656
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,829
know say distillate manufacturing like I

657
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:29,038
said in the beginning we're an artisanal

658
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:29,759
process we use small batches and that's

659
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,388
how we like it

660
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,740
you know the control factors and so

661
00:27:33,388 --> 00:27:37,138
we're you know right now with our

662
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,359
current demand you know we need anywhere

663
00:27:37,138 --> 00:27:41,788
from 300 to 600 pounds a month which

664
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,469
it's with you I'm sure no is absolutely

665
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:45,599
nothing I mean I have some biomass

666
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,278
sources that won't take my call unless

667
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,619
I'm asking for thousands yeah a week

668
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,329
yeah exactly so you know we're looking

669
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:52,979
for very fresh material we're willing to

670
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:55,589
pay a premium over the general market

671
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:59,669
but you know it has to specifically be

672
00:27:55,589 --> 00:28:02,730
you know a trichome dries out basically

673
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:04,950
within 30 days so you have are we won it

674
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,929
cured but we don't want it to dried out

675
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,819
so it's like that middle point do you

676
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:11,700
have the after its cured to a certain

677
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:13,349
point do you have them freeze it it can

678
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,350
I've learned over the years that

679
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:18,689
freezing is not the best thing so you've

680
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:20,278
heard of freezer burn yeah right so

681
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,679
freezer burn is another way of saying

682
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:25,740
that things are drying out it dries out

683
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:28,139
as well so what happens when you go

684
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,548
below zero and if you keep going more

685
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:32,099
and more below zero is you actually

686
00:28:29,548 --> 00:28:33,569
crystallize each trichome because the

687
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:35,908
liquid in it that's left that's the

688
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:37,319
important part the oil it crystallizes

689
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:39,750
and uncrystallized and during that

690
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,428
process it loses more more of its liquid

691
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:45,109
it's kind of like if you have a water

692
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:45,110
bottle in the freezer that's low it will

693
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:50,700
yeah the best opening exactly I was in

694
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:52,798
exactly and on yeah so all of our

695
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,139
freezers interesting we keep them at

696
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:58,500
just above freezing so the ideal

697
00:28:55,138 --> 00:29:00,599
temperature is 34 all right that's it

698
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,509
right so you keep everything at 34 and

699
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:03,250
your trichomes are

700
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:05,319
little babies interesting you don't even

701
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,670
have to like if I do have a freezer that

702
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:08,649
I have to use because maybe you're doing

703
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,090
a long-term or something and I can't

704
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,320
have its advantages you just have to

705
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:14,409
make sure you're freezing without any

706
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:16,240
air just nitrogen and you know doing

707
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,740
things like that yeah and my experience

708
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,019
freezing is actually detrimental

709
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,579
interesting now so other people would

710
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:23,859
disagree with that they would absolutely

711
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:26,589
yeah I think most of the guys on the

712
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:28,750
stage freeze right yeah that's was like

713
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:30,279
for me like I'm not like all right like

714
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,720
I said I have a few things different

715
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:33,579
from your average guys now I'll give you

716
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,440
another example Phil from the other day

717
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:38,529
Phil is remove I've worked with he's a

718
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,370
proponent of using wash bags within the

719
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:44,440
washers now I for me like mixing around

720
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:46,479
like a cube yeah like for me I've

721
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,190
experienced with those extensively and I

722
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,809
found that they are really really bad

723
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,759
you know and they really destroy my

724
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:53,319
product so I mean there's differently

725
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,640
but but what so what do you think

726
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:56,259
they're doing and then what do you do do

727
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,150
you just don't use anything no I don't

728
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:59,980
use anything I've always used ice as the

729
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,840
the best agitator you know and you want

730
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,360
that free flow of ice and water to make

731
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,339
that whirlpool I'm using ice he's just

732
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,109
also has in the bag and what happens is

733
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:09,849
you don't get this movement and you

734
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:11,439
don't get these the trichomes all of a

735
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,909
sudden start they start hitting each

736
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,100
other they get caught into the creases

737
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,930
of the bag what I actually end up in my

738
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:19,329
experience and filling Ives talked

739
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:21,490
extensively about it and he always

740
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:23,649
disagrees because you know this is all

741
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:26,470
masters have their different ways and

742
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:28,509
and yeah and my experience with that is

743
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,339
I'd always get less yield rate and the

744
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:32,529
quality was a little less now what it

745
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:34,240
does with the annoying side of it is it

746
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:37,450
the machines you have to clean them more

747
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,460
so it's more labor it's more dirty yeah

748
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,890
the same kind of same experience but I

749
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,779
hope I'm much like R&amp;D and hand washing

750
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,400
I got a small little bubble bag yeah

751
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:47,980
tried it with it my guys weights you

752
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,570
fast yeah we got too much yeah I like to

753
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,370
be more free-flowing and kind of control

754
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:52,689
well right now experimenting with a

755
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:55,959
whole new set up I don't know if you

756
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,519
guys know the brutalist eyes are on that

757
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,620
okay yeah we're looking at it as well I

758
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,529
guess everybody is and they don't use

759
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:04,869
bags and they don't use but if you talk

760
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:06,819
to Frenchie as well he swears bags off

761
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:11,169
just like I do so there's definitely I

762
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:12,970
mean not the collection that's an

763
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:16,550
unfortunately that's a necessary evil

764
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:19,230
for all of us there are people that use

765
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:22,859
unless you have whistler tech yes even

766
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:24,299
in the brutalist no the only way to not

767
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:25,979
use collection bags is to go to the

768
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,599
whistler tech out of canada and you drop

769
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,759
in

770
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:36,119
3:54 said you know anyone in LA who has

771
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:38,160
a whistler tech unit now so i do and

772
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:41,069
unfortunately it's someone that is a

773
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:44,880
partner with one of my partners and of

774
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:47,309
his exposure to my world he's now you

775
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,760
know coming to compete with us and he

776
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:53,730
bought a he has a $600,000 whistler tech

777
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:55,920
set up going in van nuys in the next two

778
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,289
months and he'll be producing you know

779
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,810
is this someone who's a confident like a

780
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:02,369
respected hash maker who bought the

781
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,619
latest and greatest technology is this

782
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:07,289
some illusion who has a lot of money

783
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:08,639
it's an opportunity okay but you know

784
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:10,349
again i mean in the end of the day

785
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,240
they're they're coming I have actually

786
00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:13,799
heard two other instances and them being

787
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,170
installed the thing with Whistler is

788
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:17,940
they're so massive and custom build that

789
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,950
they literally it takes like three or

790
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,990
four months to to purchase it you have

791
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,180
to they they come and see your site they

792
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,710
approve you they actually look at your

793
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,060
schematics they build out the lab

794
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,470
specific for you you know there's

795
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,849
certain little things they can change so

796
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,400
they build it specific for your space

797
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:34,109
and like I said it's like the minimum is

798
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,420
four hundred and what you really need is

799
00:32:34,109 --> 00:32:41,009
six hundred thousand so you know they

800
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:44,009
are expensive expensive so so talk about

801
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:46,740
like but having sorry to interrupt your

802
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:48,390
question having said all that about the

803
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,589
equipment the Whistler tech in a brutal

804
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,660
is I always love to tell this to my

805
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:54,000
partners and stuff some of the best

806
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,170
stuff from some of the best masters and

807
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,759
I'm talking about the guy up north that

808
00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:00,029
I've worked with his in 50s he's doing

809
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:02,730
it for 35 years he makes it not even a

810
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:04,889
horse trough and a paddle and that's it

811
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:07,860
I steel stainless steel horse trough

812
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:10,020
yep and he doesn't get twelve thirteen

813
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:12,119
percent yields but that's not as feeling

814
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:20,099
care he gets seventy percent but his

815
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:21,329
quality is amazing impeccable it's a guy

816
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,649
though that you could never get off the

817
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:24,629
mountain and never get him in the lab

818
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:26,220
and he never works with anybody you know

819
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,320
he's just gonna always be that he's very

820
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,850
happy but you know to give you an idea

821
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:33,369
he

822
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:36,230
produce alone five pounds in four hours

823
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:39,109
I've seen him do it and that's that's

824
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:42,579
that's remarkable not many people can do

825
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:45,559
that and is he with limited equipment

826
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:47,359
getting source material from friends or

827
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:49,099
is he growing himself he's still in the

828
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:52,899
traditional marketplace and he's getting

829
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:56,089
it all from medical friends friends yeah

830
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:58,220
oh so getting back to what we were

831
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:59,629
talking about before so you're working

832
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,829
with Wonder Bread

833
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,000
what were the other things whenever I

834
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:06,079
was starting to work with right now

835
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,349
we're receiving exclusively from triple7

836
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:13,549
and project cannabis and that whole team

837
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:16,460
and then headwaters okay so what's the

838
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:18,410
interplay between you saying I would

839
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:21,380
love you to grow these genetics because

840
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:24,170
they're the best for extraction well for

841
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:26,420
example here's what we have no great

842
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:28,400
questions so we love project cannabis

843
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,630
because they have 800 light facility

844
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,760
that's around the corner from our

845
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:34,039
downtown lab so what it gives us is

846
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,020
access to light to material that was cut

847
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:39,759
the day before and since we only need

848
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:39,759
small batches it works very well for us

849
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:46,789
the the first like couple weeks or no

850
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,750
you gotta put more in there I think

851
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:50,659
that's the problem guys

852
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,489
I think Frenchy I've never seen this a

853
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:55,250
little I think Frenchy just has it fully

854
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:59,389
passed I think he's just like put it off

855
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:01,449
and then if this pole is not working

856
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:05,569
great we have another one we could try

857
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:07,389
Hey Joe if you can handle this but yeah

858
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,350
I mean it's a long process getting a

859
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:11,119
reputable grower to rule your own

860
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:12,319
genetics but what we're looking to do

861
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,150
with project cannabis from already

862
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,820
negotiations with them because they have

863
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:19,430
like I said 800 light facility each of

864
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:21,080
their rooms is twenty thirty lights so

865
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:23,509
it's easy for them to dedicate one room

866
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:26,750
to a start and strain so we're very keen

867
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,470
on having them produced just exclusively

868
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,840
for us

869
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:32,019
Himalayan genetics you know so the

870
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:37,780
proper original indoor

871
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:39,940
exactly so like Afghani to talk about

872
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,530
one really Afghani is the one I'm most

873
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,869
keen on I mean I've been working with

874
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:45,700
Afghani strains from the north and I

875
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:50,319
have a good supplier out there who grows

876
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:54,189
in greenhouses but to actually to get

877
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:57,220
your own seeds from the Himalayas to you

878
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:59,170
know to take 30 or 40 of them and to do

879
00:35:57,219 --> 00:36:01,209
some genetic testing yourself and really

880
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,460
we've you know whittled down to those

881
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:07,690
two or three phenotypes that you want

882
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:10,570
that whole process is not only entirely

883
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:12,789
fun and satisfying on a passion level

884
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:15,100
but it's incredible for marketing and

885
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:16,119
free over sure yeah people wanna know

886
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:17,710
where it's coming from

887
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,179
oh yeah I am talking from my own

888
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,730
experience that's why I started doing

889
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:22,419
what I do yes like a source where it

890
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,130
came from

891
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,139
how was process or how to get to my

892
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:28,059
hands or in my lungs and as our market

893
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:30,369
evolves it's evolving in that in that

894
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:31,869
direction I mean very acutely recently

895
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:33,579
with the vape epidemic again you know

896
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:34,750
everyone's looking for holistic products

897
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:37,299
they're looking for products that

898
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,969
guarantee you know their source and

899
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,550
that's why I turn onto just the ice

900
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:45,069
water hash yeah you know if if I was a

901
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:46,450
soccer mom and I heard this this pen was

902
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:49,510
made from just you know no gas no

903
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:51,219
nothing just ice and water yeah it's

904
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,720
gonna people gonna take off absolutely

905
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:57,969
then if they also know it came locally

906
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:59,199
sourced up and you know I'm okay bill

907
00:36:57,969 --> 00:37:03,159
knew that like you're saying that's

908
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:05,289
that's worth well it's funny cuz I my

909
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:09,389
neighbor who doesn't smoke but he has

910
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:13,090
like a b-bow pen and he's like you know

911
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:15,460
this is what is currently for people

912
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:18,460
like me in him like considered a luxury

913
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:20,550
product like a Louis Vuitton bag and I

914
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:24,220
was like yeah that's like mid grade

915
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:27,789
concentrate for premium pricing like but

916
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:28,719
your soccer mom sees the style like it

917
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:29,769
looks elegant

918
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:33,609
it's what you want to be pulling out of

919
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:36,059
your purse alright we're just putting

920
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:39,880
everything in here now okay like it I

921
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:41,170
like it there's no turning back so what

922
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,450
we're doing now is throwing some raw

923
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:45,338
product on top and we have all the press

924
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:48,199
prog our knees so just add some aroma

925
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:50,269
so talk about we didn't really we blew

926
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:52,368
through all this stuff but sorry so the

927
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:55,818
first question well so with those

928
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:57,380
Himalayan languages have nanny genetics

929
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:59,269
yeah what do you like like are you

930
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,769
looking at the trichome head size and

931
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:03,559
structure like what are you looking at

932
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:05,659
that you like about that that makes you

933
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:07,970
want to make product out of that coal so

934
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:10,818
or versus something else other than the

935
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:12,798
fact that the traditional hash going

936
00:38:10,818 --> 00:38:17,239
back so long was made with these land

937
00:38:12,798 --> 00:38:18,949
races which is by itself but you I mean

938
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:20,689
you but your question was perfect cuz

939
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:23,779
you hit the other the reason it's been

940
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:26,210
so successful as a strain for making

941
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,519
hash is the trichome size and not only

942
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:30,619
trichomes size but the plant size and

943
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:32,088
one of the great things about these land

944
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:34,670
races from from that part of the world

945
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:37,429
is there they tend to be very squat with

946
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:38,930
really big trichomes so for us right now

947
00:38:37,429 --> 00:38:40,460
on the indoor world where a lot of us

948
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:42,588
are doing double canopies and triple

949
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,630
canopies yeah like these plants are

950
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:53,480
ideal so you know we're negotiating with

951
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:55,099
them and so from what you have here

952
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,900
talked about like the nuanced

953
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:59,420
differences between Michigan is

954
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:02,150
structure Kelly hi whatever else you're

955
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:05,510
looking at as a hash maker as you get

956
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:08,539
the source raw material of these three

957
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:10,549
different cultivars so source material

958
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:12,230
for this product in particular and it's

959
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:14,929
not live resin like we talked about this

960
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,519
cured product is you want it five six

961
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:17,989
days I mean if you can get it the day

962
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:19,099
off the trim table that's great but

963
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:21,048
usually that's not possible

964
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:22,280
you're wanting within a week and that's

965
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:24,019
generally when we get it that's

966
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,579
premiering that's awesome yeah from

967
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:27,858
coming off the train they've had it in

968
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:29,900
the fridge the whole time well all the

969
00:39:27,858 --> 00:39:31,848
rooms again the people I work with don't

970
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:35,420
freeze anything they just use 40 degree

971
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:36,588
control items most prefer most people do

972
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,930
I mean I don't know who doesn't these

973
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:40,219
days but yeah cuz again when you freeze

974
00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:41,539
and unfreeze things you're actually

975
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:42,949
destroying a track home when you're

976
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:44,779
making these products it's always very

977
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:46,669
useful extracts in general to think like

978
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,230
a tricorn I mean it sounds silly what I

979
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:50,358
like to do that's right you got to be

980
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:51,829
the Tri Coleman so what's the best

981
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:54,920
environment for a track home with stuff

982
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:56,089
to stay just the same you know you're

983
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,940
you're gonna do the freezer if you're

984
00:39:56,088 --> 00:39:59,219
reheating in

985
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,119
unfreezing you know in that process like

986
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:02,098
you were talking about earlier you

987
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,630
crystallized and uncrystallized you're

988
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:05,338
pretty stressed putting stress on the on

989
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:09,690
the on the lipid structure of each tribe

990
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:11,789
fragile is inside the head and once you

991
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:17,309
ripple in the head you're drying out the

992
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:19,559
oil yeah yeah it's um like that

993
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:21,630
that's awesome my I only work with right

994
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:22,980
now is dry material and you know it's

995
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:25,170
all I can get ahold of read them yeah

996
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,329
that's it's kind of luckily that's how

997
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,250
he I get it like with five six days off

998
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:30,810
the tribal that's the best from in my

999
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,489
opinion I freeze it so maybe I'll try to

1000
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:34,889
not freeze it and see what kind of

1001
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:36,568
results I get try not freezing it check

1002
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:38,789
it out see if there's any difference um

1003
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:40,559
I go you know I've gone back on that

1004
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:41,730
once and like I think a year ago and I

1005
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,259
started freezing again and then I went

1006
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,210
back so you know I'm not a hundred on it

1007
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,650
either like anything you know yeah you

1008
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,869
go you go you're always learning I'm

1009
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,338
always I have nothing set put people

1010
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:51,869
time what do you do how you do it Mike

1011
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:53,519
man it's are just different every time

1012
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:56,880
and you got to feel out though that

1013
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,440
specific biomass different yeah and

1014
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,880
different strain sizes different

1015
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,400
trichomes like you have a favorite

1016
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:05,099
cultivar or like so far yeah you like

1017
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,349
strain strain yeah I mean anything after

1018
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:09,869
Kenny I love so Gorilla Glue it just has

1019
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:11,130
one parent Afghani I love and you can

1020
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:13,140
get a lot of gorilla glue right now in

1021
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:15,900
the market so personally I get amazing

1022
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:18,179
results with that but GG for now yeah GG

1023
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,030
for sorry um and did you for yeah

1024
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:23,578
gorilla glue for but the parent of that

1025
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,710
the male parent I think is Afghani so

1026
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:27,030
okay so that's why I like that a lot and

1027
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,679
then the other one I've had an amazing

1028
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:31,769
success over the last twelve years in

1029
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:33,029
California was Sour Diesel I mean up

1030
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:34,588
north you have a lot of access to that

1031
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,849
plan and yeah it's just a TiVo and

1032
00:41:34,588 --> 00:41:38,130
people are like that but when you make

1033
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:39,869
hash out of it you get some of the best

1034
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:42,059
results I mean that's very sure about

1035
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:43,950
sativas and constant rains in general

1036
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:46,980
like even indica people will complain

1037
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:50,159
about sativas but people that like

1038
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,630
concentrates the sativa it still sedates

1039
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,279
you pretty heavily in the differences

1040
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:56,760
you get you get you get a lot more

1041
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,720
profile options yeah you just get more

1042
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:03,300
profiles yeah more and more variants

1043
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:05,309
much lock that most like guys not most

1044
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,690
guys but like those yeah the plate

1045
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:08,719
because that's the flip like the flavors

1046
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,849
is just attractive yeah

1047
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,348
that you just had now you said the word

1048
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:13,670
not a good yield everybody it's the

1049
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:17,240
flame yeah oh yeah

1050
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:19,190
change is not a good yelder so I like to

1051
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:21,679
mix it with like but great herbs yeah

1052
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,300
yeah I like it so we're looking for in

1053
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:25,009
hash because like one of the things that

1054
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,050
everyone associates with hash is this

1055
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:29,090
couch lock feeling like people tend to

1056
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:30,680
think that hash gets more of a body high

1057
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,608
and they're absolutely correct back in

1058
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:34,789
the day that's what that's what that's

1059
00:42:31,608 --> 00:42:37,340
what people like okay too much of

1060
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:42,349
glucose yeah but today you might want

1061
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:44,539
that more as well yeah but why that's

1062
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:46,670
associated is very specific reason so

1063
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:49,849
when you have live product live

1064
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:53,720
cannabinoids a lot of it is CBG yes a

1065
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:56,180
lot of it is THC a no CBD is the

1066
00:42:53,719 --> 00:43:01,879
precursor CC BG's precursor to almost

1067
00:42:56,179 --> 00:43:08,598
all the Seabees and with thecbs CBS now

1068
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:11,300
CBN is only produced naturally no by

1069
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:13,789
oxidization and what's oxidization it's

1070
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:18,380
just it's contact with oxygen so it's

1071
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:19,849
either yeah in a way but no

1072
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,619
decarboxylation is different so

1073
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:24,200
decarboxylation speaks to taking one

1074
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:26,780
carbon trichome off of the Molokai comme

1075
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:29,149
one carbon atom off of the molecule so

1076
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:31,130
on your Delta nine molecule you have an

1077
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:33,550
extra carbon molecule right now when you

1078
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:35,750
decarboxylate you're turning it into its

1079
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:37,490
bioavailable form you're taking off one

1080
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,380
carbon molecule and that makes it

1081
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:42,979
bioavailable I'm not a chemist Thank You

1082
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:45,380
extent exactly but this is slightly

1083
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:47,570
different what we're speaking to is old

1084
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,070
old weed does the same thing I don't

1085
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:50,150
know if you smoked old hippy weed and

1086
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:52,039
like gives you like how it's locked to

1087
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:53,809
work or old Jamaicans are they that's

1088
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:55,519
one yeah I'm like old Jamaican shit I

1089
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:57,139
used to smoke in england it would spend

1090
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,009
a year on a boat getting there and I

1091
00:43:57,139 --> 00:44:00,230
give it an anyway

1092
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:03,290
why does this get us so fucked up now I

1093
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:05,929
know and it's CBN and now I've come to

1094
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:07,460
appreciate fully why I love hash and it

1095
00:44:05,929 --> 00:44:10,069
and if you really come down to it

1096
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,929
personally for me it's CBN and and what

1097
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:14,420
we're learning is the more we age

1098
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:17,089
product the more CBN is created and

1099
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,860
naturally in the flour CBN when it's

1100
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:21,350
fresh is at point zero one point zero

1101
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:23,210
two by the time it's a month old it's

1102
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:24,619
getting the two percents and we've aged

1103
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:26,990
stuff to six months and we're getting

1104
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:29,389
into the six percents and that stuff

1105
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:30,919
really does not join your hat so if you

1106
00:44:29,389 --> 00:44:32,960
took a temple ball that was buried for

1107
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,940
like ten years and pulled it out not

1108
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,360
yeah I've never been able to save has

1109
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:40,579
for ten years but in my life right I

1110
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,530
think you would yeah I mean we're

1111
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:44,869
developing multiple lines right now some

1112
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:47,120
tincture lines that are CBN derivatives

1113
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:49,579
and that's the whole intention of that

1114
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,159
yeah I'm a big believer in CBN I'm I

1115
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:58,159
love the couch lock III go low to get

1116
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:59,750
high that's snapper yeah yeah I'm a very

1117
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,089
high per individual naturally so I love

1118
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:04,159
CBS I feel the same way super yeah I'm

1119
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:06,730
the opposite a TV beeps do you like

1120
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,730
going going

1121
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:13,400
yeah so that's it I mean that's also why

1122
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:15,050
we we prefer that the cured product you

1123
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,180
know and that's why people that's why we

1124
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:20,390
built this brand in in this form for

1125
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:22,699
that level was for it really is about

1126
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:25,849
the CBN and and the oxidization that

1127
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:28,369
occurs converting those molecules for

1128
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:30,469
you yeah

1129
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:32,480
I'm still learning myself as we all are

1130
00:45:30,469 --> 00:45:34,129
and you know one thing that's helped me

1131
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,889
a lot is all the testing we do now you

1132
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:38,780
know and I'm able to R&amp;D a product one

1133
00:45:36,889 --> 00:45:41,359
month three months six months in and

1134
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,100
really see how the profile changes and

1135
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,500
you really start understanding yeah and

1136
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:47,779
and another thing that that disappears

1137
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,699
is and I've come to appreciate is the

1138
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,130
terpenes in hash disappear when it's

1139
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:53,960
cured over time and oxidized over time

1140
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:56,059
you you end up with what people say is a

1141
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:59,119
hash smell well there's actually a

1142
00:45:56,059 --> 00:46:00,769
terpene called hashing and it's that is

1143
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,380
the terpene and so some of the terpenes

1144
00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:05,780
change into this hash in terpene and

1145
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:07,269
that carries with it its own potential

1146
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:10,410
effects and

1147
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:10,409
I actually have a little half drawers
