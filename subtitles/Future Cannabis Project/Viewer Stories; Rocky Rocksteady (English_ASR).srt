1
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:23,348
how y'all doing over here with

2
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,770
Rocksteady cannabis cultivation I'm

3
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:28,689
rocky aka rocky slick well you're trying

4
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:30,460
to talk about these uh phenotypes that I

5
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:33,009
have with his THC bomb this is a video

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:36,100
that was requested by a future cannabis

7
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:37,869
project you know I love what you guys do

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,219
and I just wanted to oblige what you

9
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:41,320
guys asked for it you know I mean him

10
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:46,088
but I offered to you so this right here

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,978
is one phenotype the THC bomb this was

12
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:51,070
actually a seed that I had and as you

13
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:52,600
can tell it's a season over here by take

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,969
a look at the stem it's just huge and

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,489
thick I have these in 25 gallon plastic

16
00:00:54,969 --> 00:01:00,268
grow bags with dr. earth dry amendments

17
00:00:57,488 --> 00:01:02,828
a couple other things I use you know I

18
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:05,618
gotta say man organic is the way to go

19
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:08,439
man they'll never find flavors and

20
00:01:05,618 --> 00:01:10,060
tastes and just strong plants like like

21
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:12,519
you would somewhere else with chemicals

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,490
you know these plants have been trained

23
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:18,239
and taught you know I do a lot of a lot

24
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:22,359
of training man you know so I can get

25
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:24,640
organic no-till method I just don't have

26
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:26,769
a mulch layer up right now you know if

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,879
you're curious about some of the some of

28
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:32,829
the nutrients that I use I use a mixture

29
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,629
of a few things I use fermented fruit

30
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:37,840
fertilizers that would be the jar right

31
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:40,839
there that's cantaloupe meat and organic

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,489
honey and raw unbleached sugar and you

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,259
put it in that mason jar and you let it

34
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:46,810
do its thing for a little while and then

35
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:49,868
for my nitrogen boost I use this Alaskan

36
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,649
fish fertilizer and then over there

37
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:53,390
further down is going to be here

38
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:55,700
and more of a pumping girl I use that

39
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,009
for pH control 2 for my water instead of

40
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,450
using anything else I use that for pH

41
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:01,280
and you know just for a quick added

42
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,500
boost you know it's a good to feature

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,478
microbes you know also down here in the

44
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,009
bottom I got the compost from dr. earth

45
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:08,719
man I've gotta say this stuff is great

46
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:09,500
you see the plants blow up really really

47
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,780
fast man

48
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,628
I also use the dry amendments the dr.

49
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:18,318
earth brute fertilizer tomato herb and

50
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:21,859
vegetable and I also use the flower girl

51
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,030
which is like a two nine six or

52
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,670
something to that effect but it's

53
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,110
definitely for flower and these plants

54
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:28,548
need to be watered right now once they

55
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,110
need to you know when they're thirsty I

56
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:32,269
let him tell me so that they can you

57
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,239
know pull everything out of the ground

58
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:38,530
like they want to you know you know

59
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,530
they've been up for a little while now

60
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,579
you know this medication just came to me

61
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,319
out of nowhere this strain man I was

62
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:47,360
actually trying to get some power

63
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:49,369
cookies and some sherbert man and my

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,780
friend tossed this to me kind of

65
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,069
accidentally he said and it ended up

66
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,650
being a blessing my wife has

67
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:56,328
degenerative disc disease she's 41 years

68
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,340
old and sometimes can't walk you know

69
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:01,099
it's really bad we have four kids and

70
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,780
this specific strain not only the

71
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,579
cannabis plant itself of course helps a

72
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,909
lot but this specific strain really

73
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:09,139
gives my wife quality of life man I mean

74
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:11,449
we have four boys and we wouldn't be

75
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:13,969
running around and doing we had to do if

76
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:16,649
it wasn't for the strain that just was a

77
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:18,598
blessing in disguise you know

78
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,060
this other Fino i have over here is

79
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,719
definitely showing good traits I mean

80
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,039
it's so thick strong you know I gotta

81
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,289
say this is like no other strain I've

82
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,269
ever grown when it does flower out it's

83
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:33,509
like you can't trim me I have to get

84
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:35,939
teflon coated nonstick Fiskars to be

85
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:38,909
able to trim and it's just insane man

86
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:41,009
it's the dry sift and if you guys are

87
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:42,060
doing hash or dry sift or anything with

88
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:45,689
this pressing it

89
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,269
this plant is built for concentrates I

90
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:50,939
mean when you lie to join if it it just

91
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,680
catches on fire because of so much resin

92
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,949
and oil production inside of the plant

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,810
itself you know this is what I want to

94
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:59,548
do really man this is gonna be my

95
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,759
profession I'm just kind of starting how

96
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,930
slow and low you know and I really want

97
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,548
to know what you guys think about what

98
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,959
I'm doing here you know and if you have

99
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,730
any more questions or you guys want

100
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,310
access to any other genetics I do have

101
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:13,409
that and I'm happy to oblige especially

102
