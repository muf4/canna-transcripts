2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:20,640
my name is Maureen Smith in Boston

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:27,660
Massachusetts and embarked on a travel

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:30,839
nursing career in 2018 I decided that I

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:36,269
was going to change my life and I became

6
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:39,329
a cannabis nurse educator I don't have

7
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,670
one-on-one consults with patients I

8
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,878
advocate for the plant I advocate for

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,460
cannabis education and I advocate for

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,488
people to understand that cannabis

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,640
medicine is a viable alternative to

12
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:58,849
Western medical pharmaceuticals for

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,409
chronic and lifestyle disease management

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,588
my name is Judy Tillman and I'm a

15
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:06,719
medicinal cannabis educator based on a

16
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:09,420
graduate degree in public in education

17
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,670
but more based on my activism in support

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,618
of health care as a right and in

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,659
understanding traditional medicine I

20
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:18,090
don't think that cannabis as an herb and

21
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,770
as an herbal remedy is an alternative

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,689
the pharmaceutical industry's the

23
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:23,489
alternative and we need to be fighting

24
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:25,829
for the traditional return to

25
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:29,158
traditional medicine which worked for

26
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:31,438
various various diseases and conditions

27
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,000
for 5000 years but we didn't understand

28
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,069
the reason why it worked until the

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,379
latter part of the 20th century I'm very

30
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:40,169
happy to work with healthcare providers

31
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:42,509
in the allopathic tradition as well as

32
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,700
patients public and the industry itself

33
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,228
my background is international

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,240
solidarity movements piece of social

35
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:50,819
justice working in South Africa and

36
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,140
Nicaragua and the old Soviet Union to

37
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,789
bring human rights and health care

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,549
rights to people around the world so

39
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,409
this is my passion and we have a

40
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,170
dispensary a holistic wellness center

41
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,939
that's been alive for eight years now

42
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,439
and before that for nine years I was a

43
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:08,848
cultivator and that's me so you want to

44
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,098
know what's the biggest thing on our

45
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,929
minds today with and you said with

46
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:15,539
medical cannabis well person

47
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,370
my biggest concern is that people don't

48
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,039
understand that all cannabis is medical

49
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,569
I don't think that when people go home

50
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,429
at the end of a stressful day and have a

51
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,530
martini or two they're doing anything

52
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,299
beyond self-medicating for stress and

53
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,209
it's the same with what's called

54
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:33,060
recreational because the history of

55
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,920
cannabis in Western culture particularly

56
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,378
but Eastern culture as well has been one

57
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:40,589
that was us care using cannabis as a

58
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:42,750
source of inspiration for jazz music and

59
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,299
art and all of that we've associated it

60
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,769
so much with the pleasures of the

61
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,450
creativity that you get from getting

62
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:51,359
high that we forgot that there's a

63
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:54,780
medical motivation in the plant behind

64
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:56,760
that so my but being more direct about

65
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,938
your question about what's on my mind is

66
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:03,298
begin to continue to fill the gap of

67
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:05,400
knowledge both within our farmers who

68
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,780
are growing the medicine our medicine

69
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,370
makers who are trying to craft these

70
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,378
great medicines out of them those

71
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,200
medicines try to begin to bridge the gap

72
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:16,018
between them and the researchers such as

73
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,429
the you know cannabis clinicians and

74
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,120
many many researchers around the world

75
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:24,239
who are figuring out how cannabis heals

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,959
and treats certain conditions so there's

77
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,810
a big gap between those two the

78
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,739
knowledge gap continues throughout the

79
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:38,370
entire Western medical healthcare system

80
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:40,469
I had been speaking to you that there

81
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,019
about sixty percent of American adults

82
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:45,139
live with a chronic medical condition

83
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,579
and that forty-two percent of those

84
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:50,120
sixty percent have something that we

85
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:53,069
rn's called multiple comorbidities

86
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,049
multiple comorbidities there are 30 of

87
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:57,628
them associated with poor dietary

88
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:01,139
choices especially when coupled with

89
00:03:57,628 --> 00:04:03,658
weight gain and sedentary lifestyle this

90
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,370
includes insulin resistance type-2

91
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:07,560
diabetes high blood pressure high

92
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,408
cholesterol heart disease stroke sleep

93
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,829
apnea gallbladder disease GERD pain and

94
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:16,649
some cancers and insomnia these chronic

95
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:18,509
health problems have a negative impact

96
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,038
on quality of life and they lead to

97
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:23,550
depression and social stigma and

98
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:26,370
discrimination it is a result of toxic

99
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,480
and work-life stress

100
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:32,280
as many to use excess food and alcohol

101
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,860
as a coping mechanism

102
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,589
these poor choices are made under duress

103
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,350
because quick energy is needed to fuel

104
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:42,239
these hectic lifestyles

105
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,639
none of these are hypothetical scenarios

106
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,160
I have taken care of people from all

107
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,759
walks of life in every condition known

108
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,490
to man

109
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,000
every three nights for 12 hours a night

110
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,460
for 14 years and I know they are on

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,019
several different classes of

112
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:00,989
pharmaceuticals and that each particular

113
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:04,079
drug has the potential to cause another

114
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,668
disease state this is a national

115
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,719
healthcare crisis that we can actually

116
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:12,870
fix let's see what cannabis has to do

117
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,090
with us this is great this is the

118
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,410
tremendous opportunity and this is

119
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:19,168
probably the first interview that I've

120
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,990
done in in joint work with another

121
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:23,909
cannabis educator medical practitioner

122
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,340
like Maureen this is the perfect

123
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,110
marriage of two different knowledge

124
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,750
bases and we're both on the same page

125
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,850
about the value of cannabis and the

126
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,000
terror I'll use the word terror of

127
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,129
pharmaceuticals so everything that I

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:55,110
agree a thousand percent with everything

129
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:57,930
Maureen just said first this time um I'm

130
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:01,110
I hate to be a pessimist but I've done

131
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:03,660
presentations to doctors and nurses all

132
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,419
over the place I was at st. Jude's

133
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,950
Hospital down near San Clemente I was

134
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:10,019
presenting to a group of doctors and

135
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:11,939
nurses and there are about 25 doctors

136
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,319
and nurses in the room and about 3/4

137
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,240
through my presentation about the

138
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,740
wonders and the science and the richness

139
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,780
of what we understand about how cannabis

140
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,400
works a nurse raised her hand and she

141
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,809
says this is such good information we

142
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,459
were never taught this in nursing school

143
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,530
she says when do you think we'll be able

144
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:27,449
to integrate this into our clinical

145
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:29,429
practice as Western practitioners and

146
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:31,439
she was like really earnest about it I

147
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,759
took a really deep breath trying to

148
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,408
figure out how to answer her question

149
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,418
and a gentleman in the back of the room

150
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:38,519
an MD raised his hand and said we'll

151
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:39,699
never be able to do it and I'm like whoa

152
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,949
I wasn't gonna be that pass

153
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:44,529
why do you say that and he says because

154
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:46,810
the insurance industry will not allow us

155
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:48,489
to spend more than 15 minutes with each

156
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,780
patient and write a prescription that's

157
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,829
what we're supposed to do that's the way

158
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:55,209
the system is structured I as a patient

159
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,889
counselor when I sit down with a new

160
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:58,719
patient at DraganFlyer anywhere in

161
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:00,579
California or on the phone from

162
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,050
Australia to a group of artistic

163
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:08,289
children in on the East Coast

164
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:11,079
whenever I spend time with new patients

165
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:13,660
it's a minimum of 45 minutes and you can

166
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:16,060
see his point then I'm like wow how is

167
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:22,030
the system going to allow this change to

168
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:22,839
take place you answer the question Maury

169
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:28,689
please

170
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:30,579
I was thinking very similarly when I

171
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:32,939
woke up this morning that when you go to

172
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:36,370
a doctor Oh

173
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:39,189
traditional conventional doctor with a

174
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:43,149
serious problem on serious concerns and

175
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:45,639
you're looking for solutions they the

176
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:49,620
last two visits I've been at for my

177
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:52,419
personal you know to go to my doctor I

178
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,310
believe that I wasn't hurt at all that I

179
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,100
wasn't even listened to I think they

180
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,500
have in their mind which prescription

181
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:03,010
they're going to write for you to walk

182
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,899
out the door and I am no longer walking

183
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:07,599
out the door with a piece of paper the

184
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:10,239
prescription it's within us and it is

185
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,860
the endocannabinoid system and it is

186
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,689
through natural healing and it is

187
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:18,430
through time and it is through lifestyle

188
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:21,519
changes the sparks are being made there

189
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:27,129
are a lot of people in the medical

190
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:29,289
community who are catching on it Western

191
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:33,129
conventional medicine will always be an

192
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:35,860
option for some they just have to go

193
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:37,629
that route that's okay we just need to

194
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,759
get the message out to the people who

195
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:46,360
are willing to change and are who are

196
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:50,439
willing to nurture this type of medicine

197
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:53,089
for life to thrive for the community for

198
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,800
the people you know I

199
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,939
couldn't agree more and going back to

200
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,490
what you were saying in your previous

201
00:08:55,938 --> 00:09:00,769
comment about how it also depends on how

202
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,959
you manage stress about nutrition

203
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:05,659
exercise all of those things when we

204
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,578
started dragonfly in 2011 it was a group

205
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:10,159
of women there was a Tai Chi instructor

206
00:09:07,578 --> 00:09:12,498
a yoga instructor an herbalist Lib

207
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,028
manual lymphatic drainage instructor

208
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:16,189
they were like all of us and then

209
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:18,350
somebody everybody said I want to do my

210
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,519
practices my holistic natural healing

211
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,499
practices but I don't want to run a

212
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,899
dispensary so I got voted in to be the

213
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:26,120
admin person and which was thanks a lot

214
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,980
but but the point was we could have

215
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,470
carved out a tiny piece of real estate

216
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,420
much cheaper and become a pot shop just

217
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,160
like many dispensaries are in this but

218
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:36,769
we decided we would have space for a

219
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,509
classroom for yoga classes we would have

220
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:40,909
a practitioners individual room where

221
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:43,100
you could have massage or acupuncture we

222
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:45,169
decided we would go the extra effort to

223
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,019
make sure that cannabis was integrated

224
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:49,370
into a holistic lifestyle and we're

225
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:50,990
still struggling we're not there yet

226
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,389
we're still struggling to offer all of

227
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,459
the things that patients need to by way

228
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:56,930
of information because it doesn't do any

229
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,558
good to come in and just say oh I've got

230
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,299
cancer

231
00:09:57,558 --> 00:10:00,860
give me some cannabis for it know if

232
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,389
there's a million other if you're not

233
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,100
doing all these other things for

234
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:04,879
yourself and you're living an unhealthy

235
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,889
lifestyle

236
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,420
you can eat all eat or smoke or drink

237
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:09,889
all the cannabis in the world and it

238
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:11,899
won't do any good so I'm really an

239
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:13,730
agreement with the framework that

240
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:18,438
Maureen is suggesting about holistic

241
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:20,778
healing veterans are a powerful group

242
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:24,528
and they are moving this message forward

243
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:27,678
in a very strong way a lot of them are

244
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:30,198
healing from cannabis through cannabis

245
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:32,600
they're healing their PTSD but sorry

246
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:36,588
they're healing from PTSD through

247
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:42,800
cannabis and are becoming like you know

248
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:46,339
very vocal advocates the VA is actually

249
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:48,349
following suit they are looking for I

250
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,689
forget what they call it but they're

251
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,759
it's um they're looking at different

252
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:56,748
modalities and they're actually funding

253
00:10:52,759 --> 00:11:01,329
different modalities so I think and

254
00:10:56,749 --> 00:11:04,129
there's lots of veterans bills up in and

255
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:06,528
wherever bills go up sorry I'm not a

256
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:07,999
political person in Congress in the

257
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:10,789
national-level you're right there are

258
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:12,889
some bills proposed that are very met

259
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:14,059
with very positive attitudes on both

260
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:17,810
sides the aisle Republicans and

261
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:20,679
Democrats yeah and what I'm finding that

262
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:23,599
in practices that state-by-state the VA

263
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,609
heads of the VA will do kind of a Don't

264
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,079
Ask Don't Tell look the other way with

265
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,789
some of them and then some of them are

266
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:30,349
absolutely ideologically opposed to

267
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:32,778
cannabis in any way shape or form so

268
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,579
it's gonna be the VA is a kind of a

269
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:37,578
little bit like the state's it's gonna

270
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:39,888
be you know chipping away at it to get

271
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:42,438
it to open up but Maureen's absolutely

272
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:44,959
right the V the vets are powerful voice

273
00:11:42,438 --> 00:12:05,240
and and we work with vets as well it's

274
00:11:44,958 --> 00:12:07,369
great well I'm a member of the American

275
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,129
cannabis Nurses Association and we just

276
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:14,120
had to write an essay for a scholarship

277
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:17,829
to their first conference in New Orleans

278
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,318
and the nurse there was one for a

279
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:23,179
student nurse somebody who hadn't become

280
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:25,938
a practitioner yet and there was one for

281
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:29,958
an advanced practitioner and the

282
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:32,838
advanced practitioners essay was just so

283
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,549
heartfelt about the first time that she

284
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,339
had treated a patient with medical

285
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:40,789
cannabis it was a hospice patient but

286
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:42,970
that patient found relief and you know

287
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:48,469
was able to transform you know from

288
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:51,110
being alive to passing on in a much more

289
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:55,970
spiritual and comfortable way and this

290
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:58,339
nurse was moved so much that she decided

291
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:03,439
to devote her life to this type of

292
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:05,990
medical sorry I'm losing words but also

293
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:09,318
in Michigan I know that there's a format

294
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:10,938
in a long term nursing care facility

295
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:15,399
where they are allowed to treat with

296
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:19,519
cannabis I gave a lecture in Ukiah and a

297
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,299
woman came up to me and said that she

298
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,789
was interested

299
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:25,699
using CBD and somehow she is able to use

300
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:27,799
CBD with her mother who has dementia and

301
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,960
I have heard from her and her mother is

302
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:32,120
sleeping through the night and you know

303
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,620
and they're hoping like in six months

304
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,750
time to get her off some of her

305
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:39,889
antipsychotic meds because she's doing

306
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:42,710
so well so I think that the answer lies

307
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:46,370
deep within our cellular matrices that

308
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:49,509
has a profound ability to use beneficial

309
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,669
molecules without fretting about

310
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:54,980
political or religious or cultural

311
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:58,879
ideologies and once people get those

312
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,639
molecules and find the change and start

313
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,669
benefiting from chronic conditions that

314
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,799
they've had their entire life that was

315
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:09,379
only exacerbated by pharmaceuticals

316
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:12,259
these people are the people start

317
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:15,289
advocating so when I tell when I talk to

318
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:18,110
people I say if you get it if it works

319
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:21,409
for you if it changes your life in the

320
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:25,009
most profound way please grab somebody

321
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:28,519
else's hand and teach them what you know

322
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:29,659
that is so true it the most inspiration

323
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,090
that we've seen in all the state

324
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:34,250
legislatures were about up to 31 states

325
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,530
that have now legalized medical cannabis

326
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,179
but the patient's the parents of

327
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:40,399
children with epilepsy the patients who

328
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:42,229
come forward and speak those moving

329
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,909
stories just as Maureen is saying but I

330
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,889
would just add one little extra thing

331
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:47,870
aside from telling everybody you know

332
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:50,539
your family and friends about how it's

333
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:53,179
worked for you the orgonite organization

334
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:55,639
I'm a political activist a political

335
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:58,370
organizer for 30 years and when we work

336
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,039
with the hospice groups I've presented

337
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:04,970
to the American the Mendocino cannabis

338
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,959
Nurses Association the the Parkinson's

339
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,580
support groups

340
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:12,400
the vets groups for 20 we have six six

341
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,070
target populations and they each have

342
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:19,970
groups that represent and lobby for the

343
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:22,190
patients so whether it's hospice seniors

344
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:25,519
anyone over 65 that have particular

345
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:29,330
needs parents of children with autism

346
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,240
epilepsy athletes use this no pain no

347
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,309
gain either

348
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,829
get out get back in the game kind of

349
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:36,328
thing and I said that went wrong get rid

350
00:15:34,828 --> 00:15:39,599
of the pain get back in the game that

351
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:41,789
kind of pets are another big big big and

352
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,329
and then that's I did I get all six

353
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:46,469
anyway they each have organized

354
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:48,539
grassroots organizations that are

355
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,639
lobbying on the state level and on the

356
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:52,980
national level and people need to plug

357
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,470
into those because they it's with unity

358
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,730
that they add heft to their individual

359
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:01,949
patient voices also on a positive note

360
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,110
in that direction the National Council

361
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:05,969
for the State Boards of Nursing

362
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:09,539
regulations did come out with their 2018

363
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:11,369
guidelines for medical marijuana so key

364
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:13,409
to those guidelines are that nurses

365
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:15,240
nurse student nurses and advanced

366
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:17,129
practice and nurses must learn the

367
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:22,169
endocannabinoid system cannabis

368
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:24,269
pharmacology that cannabinoids and the

369
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:26,639
AMA has not come out with such a

370
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:30,448
statement the American you know so in

371
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,459
Canada nurses are leading the way and I

372
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:36,958
think that that's going to be the case

373
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:40,469
in America too in fact I asked a leading

374
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:43,649
researcher dr. Ethan Rousseau how are we

375
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:48,420
going to bring the medical cannabis to

376
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:52,649
the dispensaries and he said a good

377
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:55,798
doctor always listens to his nurse in

378
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:59,220
that moment I decided it was gonna have

379
00:16:55,798 --> 00:17:01,019
to be me the nurses really do lead the

380
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,298
way in elip a fee in Western medicine

381
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:21,959
they really do and that it's an Ethan's

382
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:23,338
a great a great advocate as well well

383
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,110
we've been focusing on the medical

384
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:26,788
because that's what we're about right at

385
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,958
the moment but I have three hats and one

386
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:30,269
of them has to do with policy and we

387
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,370
were talking about this earlier farmers

388
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:34,079
are the best farmers and the best

389
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:37,288
medicine makers of second and third

390
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:39,569
generation are being suppressed and

391
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:42,720
stopped by over-regulation and

392
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:46,109
ridiculous taxes people can't

393
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,929
this very high-quality craft cannabis

394
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:51,089
flour that we need for good medicine as

395
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:52,440
we have in the Emerald triangle unlike

396
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:54,178
anything else in the rest of the world

397
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,058
they can't create it they can't get in

398
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:59,159
the game and become regulated and legal

399
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:00,658
because the it's too onerous it's too

400
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:02,549
difficult it's too much money to get

401
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:04,289
involved too many taxes too much

402
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:06,450
infrastructure that's the state or the

403
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:08,490
counties requiring them to build so on

404
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,590
the cultivation level and then I know of

405
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,058
at least six medicine makers who for the

406
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,069
last eight years I've used their

407
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:16,500
medicines very effectively with patients

408
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:20,700
very good high CBD tinctures and SABS

409
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,048
and cancer THC oils they can't produce

410
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,600
their medicines under the current

411
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:26,190
regulations so we're losing very

412
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:28,558
important medicine makers for our

413
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,230
patients because of ridiculous

414
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,269
ridiculous regulations now ironically

415
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,159
both on the county level in throughout

416
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:36,690
the state of California and on the state

417
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:38,400
level we're starting to see the pendulum

418
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,919
swing back to a little bit more

419
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,840
reasonableness in the regulations

420
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,190
because not because they get it that

421
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,359
they're hurting patients but because

422
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,950
they get it that they're not getting the

423
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,629
tax revenue that they want because so

424
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,400
many people are staying in the

425
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,320
underground market because why should

426
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,059
they get legal and compliant when they

427
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,428
have to deal with all of this nonsense

428
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:58,139
you know so I think they're finally

429
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,600
beginning to get it and that's what we

430
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,890
have to advocate for to protect there

431
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,619
are not many places in the world where

432
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,299
you can get pure and potent cannabis

433
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:08,009
medicine other than the Emerald triangle

434
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:09,750
for reasons that you know I could go

435
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:11,640
into but we won't right now but

436
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,589
elsewhere Salinas Valley Tennessee

437
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,259
wherever they're they're growing things

438
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:18,230
in soil they're growing cannabis in soil

439
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:20,730
that has had previously treated

440
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,620
agricultural crops chemical nutrients

441
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,990
chemical pesticides and all kinds of

442
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:27,209
other toxins that we don't want as the

443
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,069
root cause of our medicine so we have

444
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:32,009
the unique possibility here in the

445
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:37,349
Emerald triangle to support and sustain

446
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:39,808
the most pure and potent in the best raw

447
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:41,579
materials for cannabis medicine in the

448
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:43,048
world bar no other place in the world

449
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,329
where it's a reputation that we have

450
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:47,548
around the world and if everybody

451
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:49,980
doesn't protect that and cry out to

452
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:55,170
protect it we're gonna lose it to Big

453
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:58,710
Pharma and other forces so

454
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:01,440
I came up in the time of dare and I

455
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:05,610
raised my children in the time of dare

456
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:11,490
and then I became a nurse and I had to

457
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:13,439
put veils on to sort of be able to exist

458
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:19,410
in in a culture that I didn't really

459
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:22,860
believe in I wish I had known more about

460
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:26,160
the plant and so that's the next journey

461
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:30,109
for me is to integrate the plant one

462
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:33,450
thing I do know about the plant is that

463
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:34,949
in Israel the strains are a little more

464
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,410
controlled and they're a little more

465
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,000
medicinal I don't know if controlling

466
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,430
the strains are making them more

467
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,430
medicinal rather than more marketable

468
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:47,970
through like high THC strains you know

469
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:50,789
is possible or viable or even a solution

470
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,860
I think if we create a market for

471
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:55,440
medicinal marijuana then the farmers

472
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:57,299
will grow the more medicinal varieties I

473
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,210
don't know if that's true because I'm

474
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:02,039
not a plant person unfortunately not yet

475
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,840
I want to get my hands in the ground I

476
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:06,029
want to get my hands on that plant but I

477
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:09,709
just haven't had the opportunities yet

478
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:12,869
but I I do believe that there are

479
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:15,360
cannabinoids we don't know about Israel

480
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:16,409
has been studying these cannabinoids for

481
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,459
the 80 years that we have been

482
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:21,750
prohibiting it so they know which

483
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,569
cannabinoids actually cure which

484
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:29,180
prostate cancers through the biomarkers

485
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:31,259
and they're growing to that yeah and and

486
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:34,019
absolutely right Mirena is absolutely

487
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:37,319
right and not just Israel but University

488
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:39,059
of Bonn and potency in Madrid and Oxford

489
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:40,799
and Brazil is doing a lot of really good

490
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:42,720
work as well everywhere in the world

491
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,019
where they didn't have this silly war on

492
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,789
drugs that also included marijuana you

493
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:49,139
know it's just just it's a crazy Alice

494
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:51,240
in Wonderland world in the United States

495
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,130
right now it'll end with time that will

496
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,900
change but it does take time to change

497
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,970
people's attitudes the one thing I would

498
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,740
say is that this I think there's a false

499
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:01,500
notion that the dispensaries have

500
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,630
recreational marijuana and we're trying

501
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,730
to get medicine in there I again will

502
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,890
say that I think all cannabis is

503
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,549
medicinal the question of which is the

504
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,890
best to live

505
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:12,960
system which are the best ratios which

506
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,490
is the best dosing all of that can be

507
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,340
done within the products that are being

508
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:19,259
created now and we just need to educate

509
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:21,569
our staff in these various dispensaries

510
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:23,369
so they can give honest good information

511
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:25,200
to the patients there's a huge gap there

512
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:26,759
23 licensed types of the state of

513
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,799
California but there's not one of those

514
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:30,779
licenses that has the state of

515
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,879
California has has directed any

516
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:35,789
resources toward public and patient

517
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,890
education zero zip so we're on our own

518
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:39,480
out here and having said that there's

519
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,830
still a big gap between the research

520
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,529
that's being done in places like Israel

521
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:45,210
and what our farmers are cultivating and

522
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:47,009
are what our medicine makers are making

523
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,259
we need to close that gap so that we

524
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:50,819
begin to see it's not just a question of

525
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:52,170
the markers and figuring out because

526
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:54,539
even with that study on pancreatic

527
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:57,060
cancer in Israel they ran into a problem

528
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:59,190
halfway through the study because the

529
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:01,919
cultivator hired on contract by the

530
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:04,650
Israeli government switched one nutrient

531
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,660
in that very controlled indoor grow and

532
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,680
all of a sudden they had completely

533
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,150
different results and they couldn't

534
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,920
figure it out but fortunately they were

535
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,790
able to trace it back I was on an

536
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,350
international webinar that where they

537
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:19,139
talked to the person who was doing that

538
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:20,849
study and he says we spent we were going

539
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,710
crazy 24/7 trying to figure out what did

540
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:24,990
we do wrong it was one little variable

541
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,880
so there's a lot of science that still

542
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,769
needs to be applied to our cultivation

543
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,780
and to our medicine making and we're not

544
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:32,779
that those structures aren't set up yet

545
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:40,379
system is under genetic control so it's

546
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:43,440
it's gonna be personalized and different

547
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,270
for every single patient which is a good

548
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,529
at a bad thing because what we know

549
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:47,609
about herbal medicine that's

550
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:49,559
fundamentally different from

551
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:51,479
pharmaceuticals is it's individuated

552
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:53,099
from a suitable treat patients like

553
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,329
we're cookie cutters take two aspirin

554
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,219
every four hours no matter what's wrong

555
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:57,960
with you how big you are how small you

556
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,880
are male female child and whatever

557
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,200
that's crazy medicine it doesn't it's

558
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,970
not the way our bodies work so that's

559
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,690
there's a good in a bad part to that

560
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,690
yeah for sure

561
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,819
well I have a lot of fantasies but

562
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:22,649
they're not fantasies that are mine

563
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:25,109
alone because there are groups that are

564
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,390
organizing around some key aspects of

565
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:30,449
where do we go next in cannabis

566
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:32,100
regulation and such as if you look

567
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,798
through the state of California those

568
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:37,709
counties or those sectors of different

569
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:40,980
counties who have had strong trade

570
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:44,400
associations have achieved the most

571
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:47,730
traction in Sacramento and in their

572
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,110
local county seats so here we have the

573
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,700
coming together of a couple of

574
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:52,798
grassroots organizations in something

575
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,048
called MCA the Mendocino cannabis

576
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,539
alliance now what we need to focus on is

577
00:24:55,048 --> 00:24:59,759
menace as MCA and becoming a very strong

578
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,769
voice on behalf of our farmers our

579
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,440
cultivators our medicine makers our

580
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:06,569
distributors our dispensaries all of us

581
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,470
in not just Mendocino but our entire

582
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:13,019
Emerald Triangle area a region is we

583
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:16,009
need to focus on lifting these onerous

584
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:18,660
regulations treating it as a regular

585
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:21,240
agricultural crop get the helicopters

586
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:24,090
out of our backyards lift the tax burden

587
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,250
that welcomes invites people to become

588
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:29,279
compliant and legal make it easier for

589
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:32,329
them to do that support an Appalachian

590
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,980
system that would create a protective

591
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:36,449
envelope around the craft cannabis that

592
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,950
exists in the Emerald triangle that's

593
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,720
unique and different from anything

594
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,580
they've when they throw seeds into the

595
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,960
dirt in Salinas Valley or Kentucky or

596
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:45,779
wherever they're throwing seeds into the

597
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,120
dirt these days it will distinguish the

598
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:51,750
the high quality and the purity and the

599
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:54,000
potency that becomes the basis of our of

600
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,829
our medicine we don't have to create a

601
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,839
market the market is out there just

602
00:25:55,829 --> 00:26:00,210
since January 1st 2018 with the

603
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,769
legalization in California people are

604
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,808
coming out of the woodwork because they

605
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:05,129
have there's patient needs patients are

606
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:08,129
coming out of the woodwork and saying I

607
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,690
want to try cannabis instead of being

608
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,610
dependent on all these pharmaceuticals

609
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,650
that have all these side-effects so we

610
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:15,959
need to organize ourselves as an

611
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:19,169
industry and have a strong voice at the

612
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:23,100
table to create a supportive at a

613
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:24,900
supportive fiscal of tax and regulatory

614
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:26,879
environment for our

615
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:31,920
people in the industry to keep making

616
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:35,520
those hi craft hi heritage value pure

617
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,590
and potent materials by biological

618
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,170
materials I'll just be brought about it

619
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:42,929
biomass flowers everything that we need

620
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:47,910
to create these medicines so we need we

621
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:49,980
need that kind of organization my

622
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,990
personal belief is that everybody has a

623
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,190
right to thrive up to their level of

624
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,769
their ability

625
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:59,940
I believe the Western medical model does

626
00:26:55,769 --> 00:27:05,369
not believe have the same belief many

627
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:08,370
are caught in a trap of working in a

628
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:10,859
toxic work environment coming home

629
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:14,219
stressed taking their stress out on

630
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:16,919
their families you know and the cycle

631
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:23,430
just continues and you know people are

632
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:26,640
turning to opioids alcohol food even

633
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:30,210
hectic lifestyle as an addiction many

634
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,440
are depressed many are anxious we have

635
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:36,180
the highest level of stress in ten years

636
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,990
cannabis medicine can bring the change

637
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:43,950
that we need to our culture to our

638
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:46,170
society we've just gone mad we have gone

639
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:49,230
mad with collective madness with all

640
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:51,650
this trying to keep up with the Joneses

641
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:54,210
trying to buy the best couch like

642
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,490
constantly watching TV our kids are

643
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:59,009
feeling it our kids are stressed

644
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,490
overweight and pre-diabetic

645
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:04,700
there needs to be a cultural shift

646
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,700
cannabis will
