[Music]

2
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:21,169
some of the practitioner and business

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:23,689
person where do you see it going yeah I

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:27,589
mean unfortunately I think the Golden

5
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:30,588
Age of innovation is kind of behind us

6
00:00:27,588 --> 00:00:31,309
just in California in general like I

7
00:00:30,588 --> 00:00:32,539
still think there's going to be

8
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:34,399
innovative products things are still

9
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:36,409
going to happen but it's not going to be

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,850
a proliferation and at the rate that it

11
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:40,179
has been in the last three years and

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:43,100
yeah or the last five years right and

13
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:46,189
and primarily because once especially

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,750
what's metric kicks in right track and

15
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:49,369
trace and Rd and the costs associated

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,329
with it are gonna be kind of stifling

17
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:51,968
because there's not going to be an

18
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:54,018
abundance of cheap readily available

19
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:56,058
biomaterial that you can just experiment

20
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:58,460
with and then you know compost right so

21
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:59,899
I think that the technological

22
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,179
advancements are going to be far more

23
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:04,760
scientific as we attract scientists into

24
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:07,070
the industry which will be great but the

25
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,509
the amount of products that are on the

26
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:10,639
market now I think you're gonna see

27
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:11,989
decrease but there'll be new ones you

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,579
know to replace them but just not the

29
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,658
abundant amount that we've already had

30
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:16,599
and you're seeing that already in

31
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,009
California you know there's

32
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:20,719
significantly less types of products and

33
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:22,250
left skews than there was in December

34
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,618
you know my company for example we cut

35
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,688
half of our SKUs we may bring them back

36
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:28,310
but with the testing and the inventory

37
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:30,228
requirements you know many many

38
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,379
companies have dropped what aren't their

39
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:35,450
top producers and sellers so and you

40
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:38,149
know I also see it going to Canada so

41
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,500
you know it's kind of sad because I

42
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:41,329
always felt like California should own

43
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,879
the United States marketplace especially

44
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:45,679
the California marketplace and you know

45
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:48,228
because we don't have access to you know

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,750
basic tools that most other businesses

47
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:52,938
get such as banking and loans and

48
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,540
deployment of capital or reasonable

49
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:56,089
rates

50
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,439
you know Canadians are coming in and and

51
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,090
for better or worse they're actually

52
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,798
allowing a lot of us to survive because

53
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,240
they can bring in institutional capital

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,210
and allow us to scale our businesses and

55
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:08,689
get through this trying time right now

56
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:10,699
you know 2,500 plus clients in the

57
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:12,740
entire state in December shrunk down to

58
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,060
400 now so there's 6,000 plus

59
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,620
manufacturers in the state

60
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,420
that are trying to sell the same 400

61
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,860
dispensaries and we can't charge more

62
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:22,219
money for our product and our margins

63
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,599
are less than they've ever been so you

64
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:26,359
know I think we'll get through this and

65
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,310
it'll be a strong strong place but you

66
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,680
know it's things are changing and

67
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,060
they're changing fast so you know what

68
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,800
trends have you noticed in the last

69
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,509
couple years that have kind of like come

70
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,550
on and fizzled out or replace the other

71
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:39,318
thing so you know rosin was like the

72
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,480
cannabis equivalent of quell back in

73
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:43,629
2015 everybody was talking about it so

74
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:47,090
we're you know where are we at now I

75
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:50,150
mean for us had Eden labs you know we've

76
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:53,239
made ethanol extractors since the

77
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,590
beginning and that was kind of what we

78
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,590
built the company on then it kind of

79
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,479
faded out and it was all co2 from 2010

80
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,920
until a year ago and then all of a

81
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,609
sudden ethanol made this roaring

82
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:06,409
comeback and so you know we've we've

83
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,569
made some adjustments to the systems to

84
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:11,030
for the modern cannabis ethanol

85
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:13,189
extraction and we've come up with a

86
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,110
system of being able to steam distill

87
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:17,299
terpenes first and then do the ethanol

88
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,910
extraction and that's been the major

89
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:21,769
change we've seen within our company is

90
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:24,349
all of a sudden people wanting ethanol

91
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:26,599
again so it's a I'd love selling the co2

92
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:28,909
and the ethanol systems I'm really happy

93
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:35,299
that they've made a you know a comeback

94
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:37,699
and that's the main thing I don't know

95
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:41,209
how these trends start I mean the

96
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:42,738
industry's got a lot of like things just

97
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,670
kind of appear out of nowhere

98
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:49,459
and he can since these things actually a

99
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:52,369
processor you know we we find out quick

100
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:55,960
and we offer a new product but I don't

101
00:03:52,370 --> 00:04:00,580
know how the trend got started

102
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:03,730
I think I think I think a/c wants to

103
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:07,600
come join us yes so much to say over

104
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:09,219
there no I think you know I think

105
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,129
primarily the trend with ethanol really

106
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:14,069
uptick does distillation we came on to

107
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:17,050
the scene and become more commonplace

108
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,819
it's a very wonderful solvent that plugs

109
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,460
really well into a thin film or

110
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:23,409
molecular distillation or short path so

111
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,149
it's the most efficient way to just get

112
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,700
a bulk extract that you can short path

113
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:33,879
right predominantly the reason why it's

114
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:39,389
been so popular yeah so I think some of

115
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:42,579
the trends start with someone having a

116
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:44,979
success and then it's sort of broadcast

117
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:49,029
I think the ethanol comes on because of

118
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,560
the hemp a products coming through hemp

119
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:52,899
is not a clever product

120
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,250
it's got CBD in it and you're trying to

121
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:56,739
get CBD and make sure you're not having

122
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,269
the THC you're not trying to get out the

123
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,560
terpenes most of the time from the hemp

124
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:02,859
product so it's not a very clever

125
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,389
product and so with ethanol and you can

126
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,180
do it at room temperature you can do it

127
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:09,370
at zero degrees 10 degrees minus 10

128
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,699
degrees minus 20 minus 30

129
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:16,000
so between minus 38 minus 43 it starts

130
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:17,649
to act like subcritical co2 and the

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,439
timing will be about the same so you'll

132
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:22,599
have the same sort of process so if you

133
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,550
look at that that it kind of moved from

134
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,189
that very non clever and then you

135
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,870
started to have more of the distillation

136
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:31,269
which for you know for myself as an

137
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,889
organic chemist it's just it's not a

138
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:34,479
very clever process either you just

139
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:36,819
bring it over and at some vapor pressure

140
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,550
it comes over and drops into the other

141
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:41,379
side where I think things will move

142
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,680
towards a more clever side isn't is not

143
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:48,339
using ethanol as a distillation but

144
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,560
using it through organic filters so

145
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:52,689
taking organic filters there's a process

146
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,220
where if I even have ethanol no matter

147
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:55,930
where it came from its a four to one or

148
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,730
if it came from an ethanol extraction at

149
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,650
whatever temperature I can bring it

150
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,870
through something that's a 600 molecular

151
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:04,500
weight ethanol filter and everything

152
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,790
greater than 600 stays on this side

153
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,459
everything less than 600 goes through

154
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,080
the path now I now I in essence I

155
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:13,739
taking out my lipids and I taking out my

156
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,909
waxes and I haven't done anything

157
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,560
extracted I haven't done any heat I've

158
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,840
just pushed things through a filter then

159
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,089
you move to the next one you take that

160
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,818
and you move it through a 200 micro a

161
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:26,379
200 molecular weight filter and now

162
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,669
everything greater than 200 stays on

163
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:30,098
this side of the filter and everything

164
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:32,469
less than 200 stays on that side ethanol

165
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:34,089
is less than 200 molecular weight so now

166
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,160
you haven't done a distillation you've

167
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:38,258
just separated it through a filter and

168
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,419
all you're left with is between 200 and

169
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:42,939
600 and cleverly enough the cannabinoids

170
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:44,469
are between 200 and 600 and so now

171
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,240
without having anything you have about 2

172
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,310
percent ethanol without having to do any

173
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,250
extraction so I'll see that as a as a

174
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,319
flow through process and the and the the

175
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,788
smaller ones will still do separate

176
00:06:53,319 --> 00:07:01,209
modules when you start to move towards

177
00:06:56,788 --> 00:07:02,348
350 acres of different hemp now you're

178
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:03,638
going to have a process where you're

179
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:06,848
just going to move - this thing is an

180
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,259
entire process now your your chemistry

181
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:10,000
works better so I see the innovation

182
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,759
salt I'll take one more exception and

183
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,259
that is is its I don't think it's over

184
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,788
yet I mean it's the same thing as you

185
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:17,740
know everything's but ever it's been

186
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:19,810
invented it's been invented that is not

187
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,430
the case and I think that the NICS I

188
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:26,800
think the next generation out there

189
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:29,110
that's between 25 and 40 and the and the

190
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,400
older ones be well Fritz is still under

191
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:35,229
60 right just under well I'm not and so

192
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,000
next year I get to collect medicaid but

193
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:38,468
on my side I'm seeing the the organic

194
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,060
chemists come through and they're the

195
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:41,228
next innovators so now you have the ones

196
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,519
in the middle that are paying for

197
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:44,439
college they're not gonna risk anything

198
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:47,379
to move through a career but but those

199
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:50,439
25 to 30 year olds oh they are gonna

200
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:52,149
come through and just ramp up this this

201
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,098
entire thing and I think the next golden

202
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:55,448
age comes from that I think that I think

203
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,129
there's so much innovation out there

204
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,300
that what we don't know we don't know

205
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,038
and I think that they're gonna come out

206
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,848
with themself like they like the filters

207
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:05,050
where you're not having to do

208
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:07,389
distillation I think also you know just

209
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,978
continuing breeding for a certain

210
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:12,158
cannabinoid level you know if I've

211
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:14,228
fantasized about having a THC v carts

212
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,098
cartridge in the marketplace for years

213
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:17,740
now and

214
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:20,050
you know so really working with

215
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,400
selective breeding or you know I'll say

216
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,038
it because I'm crazy but CRISPR

217
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,418
technology right I mean terrific to to

218
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:27,278
have innovations where these more

219
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:29,829
obscure harder to find cannabinoids now

220
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:32,469
are able to be easily produced easily

221
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:33,578
cultivated may be grown in yeast but you

222
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,750
know I think that you'll see a lot of

223
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:36,750
innovation around that

224
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:46,828
