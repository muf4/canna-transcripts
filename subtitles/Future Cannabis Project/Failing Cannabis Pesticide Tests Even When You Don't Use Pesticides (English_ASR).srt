2
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:19,350
can you talk more about the residual in

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:22,198
specific pesticides and it seems like

4
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,730
some growers have been surprised that

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,539
there

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,099
the test results are coming back as

7
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:32,160
having contamination from pesticides

8
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,840
when they weren't even using those

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,009
pesticides so talk about some of those

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,359
surprises and and why that's occurring

11
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:41,009
mostly when it comes to when it comes to

12
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,530
growers who get surprised at their of

13
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:45,058
their product was dirty a lot of them

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,429
are surprised that it's dirty because

15
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,558
they sprayed it early in its cycle and

16
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:53,579
so they're surprised that it didn't go

17
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:55,619
away it's it's typically not pesticides

18
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,530
that you see move downstream it's

19
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:00,390
fungicides and fungicides reason being

20
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,939
is that indoor cultivation doesn't

21
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,099
really generate using ultraviolet and

22
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,109
ultraviolet is what's needed to break

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,688
down some of these fungicides into a

24
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,340
more inert form and so when you can when

25
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:12,750
you apply something like Eagle 20 my

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,060
computer and all to an indoor grow in

27
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,409
any capacity meaning your mom ops or

28
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,469
always indoor

29
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:24,270
all of these situations we found create

30
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:27,839
reserve maybe up to five to seven years

31
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:29,218
to where the facility itself has

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,200
contaminated meaning that there's

33
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:34,048
particulate of like a boots are all

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,420
present in the space and pieces of it

35
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,599
break off and land on your cannabis and

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,609
so runes that we used prior that we're

37
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,909
having been used in years are coming up

38
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:47,309
hot and so any of these facilities that

39
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,689
were priorly used they're they're

40
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,060
registering hot because there's

41
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:53,368
contamination that won't break down for

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,439
most of the growers that are coming up

43
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:56,519
with problems now in concentrate for

44
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,648
them which is really where you see it

45
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,908
it's almost you know sixty eight percent

46
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,549
of the issues might have you turn off

47
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,259
and and and I would say probably these

48
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,719
forty the first percent of it's coming

49
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,329
from the mothers so what you have is you

50
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:12,750
have this incredible quantity of

51
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:15,420
nurseries that are using tools to give a

52
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,189
stellar appearance but that product

53
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,809
cannot be used in the concentrate

54
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:20,340
industry and so what we know is the

55
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,370
nursery is that I get borders all the

56
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,549
time to fill clients who have bought

57
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,980
products that have then blown dirty and

58
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:32,909
they can even test the clone and a clone

59
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:34,918
will not detect any levels so you can't

60
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:37,109
test the mom or test the clone it won't

61
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,299
come up in veg you have to literally

62
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:42,090
take that product and make it into a

63
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:43,919
super concentrate and accentuate it and

64
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,689
then you'll know if you can use it or

65
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,980
not and it makes it really difficult

66
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:51,568
because it's when you ever you receive

67
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:53,129
any cologne stock you have to actually

68
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:55,229
find out you know hey how was the mom's

69
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,168
been treated and who honestly wants to

70
00:02:55,229 --> 00:03:01,139
tell you hey they cheated on the job

71
00:02:57,169 --> 00:03:03,240
right or even you're saying even if they

72
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,949
and it turned out but the producer would

73
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,780
know the producer would know see the

74
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:10,019
bottom line is if the producers move in

75
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,090
stock that's dirty how did they get

76
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,490
forward then the producer so if you're

77
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,840
producing the material there is no way

78
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,510
you didn't know what was the input

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,460
material and and for us we're licensed

80
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:22,109
through the Department AG for spray

81
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,820
meaning the night we have a spray

82
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,470
license this is a you know I have a

83
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,889
degree in nursing practice this is like

84
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:30,629
actually nursery and what it does is it

85
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,489
lets us have a very now we're running

86
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:35,069
all organic spray methodologies but

87
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,080
every single thing we use is documented

88
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,449
and given to the AG department monthly

89
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,969
so everything we use how much we use

90
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,399
what's fragrance what intensity is more

91
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:47,520
patterns what we used it for I mean an

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,239
entire program is created to monitor all

93
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,580
of this there's no way you're you're not

94
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,709
aware what you're doing and everyone

95
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,290
says well a worker did it well what

96
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,840
worker is so inclined to kill the

97
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:03,449
businesses money without direction from

98
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,599
the leadership and so what I know is

99
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:08,339
that people who pick up the stock in a

100
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,590
way that it nursery could make the stake

101
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,219
is they get clonal material from someone

102
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,780
to start the mother process that's a

103
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:17,879
tough one because you basically have to

104
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,600
almost throw the plant that came out

105
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:24,389
flour some of it below it test it if

106
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,460
it's a zero you can run it you see the

107
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:29,519
project it's an extremely time-consuming

108
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:31,579
process that's why so much of the stock

109
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,639
that I sift in clonal forms

110
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:36,228
seed so I sift clones but I get them

111
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,139
from people like me that are organically

112
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:41,089
based meaning living soil biological

113
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:42,918
predation so this way what we know is

114
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:45,560
that the material used by me or anybody

115
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:47,180
else like me is shareable but if it's

116
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,189
coming from strangers I have no idea

117
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,800
what it is and so basically I have to

118
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:53,120
run it and then blow some of it to see

119
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,478
below mean and turn him into a

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,329
concentrate to see is a clean source but

121
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,788
if I go from seed then I can get around

122
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:03,500
that but the public doesn't want seed

123
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:05,029
they don't want differentiation they

124
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,968
want very similar products otherwise

125
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:11,478
Nike wouldn't be Nike gonna be sneakers

126
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:12,860
but its Nike so people want Nike and and

127
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,089
in the market you have to understand

128
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,038
that and that's where seed becomes

129
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:19,038
difficult because seed lets us sift for

130
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:21,110
progeny pulls out phenotype but it

131
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,120
doesn't allow us a stability yet and so

132
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,560
for a lot of individuals you know you've

133
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,620
got to make sure you understand where

134
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,879
you gather in the source stock from and

135
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,490
where you're producing it and if you're

136
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:34,310
inheriting old buildings were they used

137
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,949
previously and if these buildings we use

138
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,418
previously we gets into another problem

139
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,978
is now you have let's weigh abroad and

140
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:41,329
Russert might sly because they used to

141
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:42,949
be through it and Russert like that came

142
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:44,718
from all the other agricultural

143
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:47,060
industries prior any nursery is going to

144
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:49,218
have them and then now you have an

145
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,588
incredible concentration of russet might

146
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:55,610
being applied to Humble Trinity Mendel

147
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:58,528
or for the species annotation of star

148
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:01,139
thistle so they've used

149
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:03,058
might control in Canada for decades and

150
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,709
now they're using it heavily in our area

151
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:07,229
to control you know these these

152
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:09,778
unnatural plants where they calm

153
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:12,028
invasive species but the problem is it's

154
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:14,759
it'd be like if you went and sprayed for

155
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:17,338
a vase of species in Napa and you shot

156
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,788
out you know the lacewing or the or the

157
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:23,189
great borer or whatever the nasty

158
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:25,528
pathogen is for grape that's basically

159
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:27,149
what happened for us here and so the

160
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:29,488
Russert might became such a massive

161
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:32,098
issue because it holds dormant well and

162
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:34,228
when it comes out it's unlike anything

163
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:36,209
anybody seen no one knew how to identify

164
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:38,038
it and because it's microscopic in size

165
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:40,559
you can't see it moves too fast and if

166
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:43,318
you can tidy the damage or the silicon

167
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:45,838
module egg blamin then you really can't

168
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,569
pinpoint what it is but what we found

169
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:50,189
with russet light is really in

170
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:52,679
vegetative form as sulfur works

171
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:55,588
fantastic so either micronized sulfur is

172
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:58,168
dry or or or wettable sulfur sprayed wet

173
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:58,939
and it absolutely tears these things up

174
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,099
and

175
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:03,949
we can spray them out we can control and

176
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:07,400
then what we did for flower is where you

177
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:09,920
can't use sulfur as you get into

178
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,389
biological predation and by biological

179
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,400
predation is getting a hold you bug deal

180
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,259
up and what you're gonna do is you're

181
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,969
gonna work out a strategy of what bugs

182
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,339
to use and they're gonna be combinations

183
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,110
of juveniles and adults so the juveniles

184
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:23,299
can hatch over a twenty thirty day

185
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,000
period and come out sequentially and the

186
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,560
adults are already tree starved and so

187
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,290
when I had wrested mites at my farm this

188
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,670
year and so we they blew in they must

189
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,740
have blown over a mountainside how many

190
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,750
farms around me so they win more and

191
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,430
they can move four miles and they land

192
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,170
that on the bench and we saw some pirate

193
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,600
bugs and pirate bugs typically let you

194
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,160
know you have other bugs that are being

195
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,810
eaten by the pirate bugs because they

196
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,160
don't just colonize the example above

197
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,290
higher their yellow with a little black

198
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,430
dot on so they just named Oh pirate bugs

199
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,870
but they're in there it's just like if

200
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,910
you have ladybugs all over the place

201
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,610
odds are there must be a third somewhere

202
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,470
so when you when you look at predators

203
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,090
if you have a lot of wolves in your

204
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,860
neighborhood you probably have some deer

205
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:03,529
you have a lot of beer you probably have

206
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,780
trash there's they're going after

207
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:08,689
something and so predators let us find

208
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:10,819
prey easier than we see prey because

209
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:13,310
printers are always bigger so predators

210
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:15,829
let us see on bugs we can see the thing

211
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,439
we're looking for and then we can say

212
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:21,359
okay that's a sign and so my my farm

213
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:24,750
guys spent located the

214
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,090
the Pirates we did the ID found the

215
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,459
rustle and what we did was an aggressive

216
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:32,038
biological attack on where we went in

217
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:34,199
three times the normal pressure so if it

218
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,778
was to add you know a thousand sachets

219
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,278
we went up to 3,000 sachets and what it

220
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:41,639
did was it allowed me this incredible

221
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:42,750
ability to actually out fight the

222
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,028
infestation

223
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,769
so as the infestation was increasing I

224
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:50,129
was I was running at a much higher level

225
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:51,709
of predation so literally I just blasted

226
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:55,528
him right out so I might have only lost

227
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:58,109
you know maybe 3% of the total to

228
00:08:55,528 --> 00:09:00,870
Russert damage and I would have lost you

229
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,129
know 40% so they will be talking radical

230
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,139
differences and we're not talking huge

231
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:06,509
money a normal application of bugs for

232
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,139
me would be about 3,500 it cost me 10

233
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:10,799
grand

234
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:13,078
- absolutely seal it and if I had

235
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,059
realized it and I should have known what

236
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:16,559
do I know from this lesson that next

237
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:18,689
year when I put the plants out we just

238
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,509
lay out all the beneficial sachets with

239
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,250
the crop the whole time and that way the

240
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:24,929
release is just continuous and we just

241
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,379
know that russets will come back and

242
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:30,028
that's how it is but as we control the

243
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:31,769
vegetative plants with sulfur so that

244
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,720
we're not having any issues we get them

245
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:35,519
into the garden organically boost them

246
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,110
up so that they're healthy add the

247
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,289
predation and now we have a biological

248
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,209
balance

249
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:42,188
and so that it's not the issue that

250
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:44,018
people thought it was but it is when you

251
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:45,969
don't know how to control it and most

252
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:47,709
people miss diagnose it terribly because

253
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,239
they see the browning of the pistols and

254
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,308
they think that the plan is prematurely

255
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:53,649
flowering they don't realize that it's

256
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:55,418
just straight diet and because they're

257
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:57,519
miss diagnosing it they don't have the

258
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:59,399
ability to actively fight it by the time

259
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,808
they really realize what they have

260
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,038
basically it's like having stage 4

261
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:05,948
cancer that's how much you can do at

262
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:07,899
this point it's it's aggressive so you

263
00:10:05,948 --> 00:10:08,948
have to catch it when it's stage one you

264
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,778
got to get the freckle when it's

265
00:10:08,948 --> 00:10:13,688
misshapen not not when it's a giant

266
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:15,578
tumor the size of a grapefruit and I

267
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:18,009
don't think people are familiar enough

268
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:20,409
with the real cultivation practices of

269
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:23,019
this type of thing because we're all

270
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:25,629
learning really new predation meaning

271
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:27,639
what we use new paths new pathogens one

272
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:30,100
of the things we're fighting and new

273
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:33,548
tools what can we what can and can't we

274
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:37,190
use so new and new and new creates

275
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:48,428
problems but if it's workable

276
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:48,429
