1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,199
what's going on guys brandon rust i'm

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,799
going to show you guys how i

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:09,919
am making a biological fertilizer out of

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,620
green waste from temple or cannabis so

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,780
the first thing i do is i mulch up the

6
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:14,779
[Music]

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
material

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,840
really easy i bought this off of amazon

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,720
i think was like 175 bucks

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,480
you come over here you come check out

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,759
the material

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,200
you see it's mulched up pretty fine

13
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,479
um and what i'm going to do is i'm going

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,600
to fill up this five gallon bucket

15
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,199
and it'll fit about 12 pounds of

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,800
material i've already done the

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,320
measurements prior to the the video

18
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,320
when i've made this before

19
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,799
you just fill that all the way up like

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
so

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,200
it's okay to pack it in pretty tight

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,760
and you want to fill it all the way up

23
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,920
now

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,080
after you have all of your uh your

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,600
bucket filled up with your material

26
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,759
you go ahead and fill it all the way up

27
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,959
with water

28
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,560
it's approximately uh two and a half

29
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,199
gallons

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,200
of water

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,759
and this will actually make all of the

32
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:44,319
minerals and nutrients

33
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:47,040
bioavailable and it will also

34
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,239
create lots of different amino acids and

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,840
enzymes

36
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,959
that will help increase the microbiology

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,719
in the soil

38
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,399
so it's kind of two for one you get the

39
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,158
biology

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,478
plus you get the minerals and nutrients

41
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,040
you get amino acids you get enzymes you

42
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,519
get

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,320
plant hormones you get different types

44
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,599
of

45
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,359
you know oxen cytokinin tuberic acid

46
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,079
all that stuff is all contained within

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,080
this material

48
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,919
and then the next step is you're gonna

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,759
use

50
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,280
a thousand milliliters of molasses

51
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,840
i'm just gonna go ahead and dump that in

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,840
there

53
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,159
and last but not least a liter 1000

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,519
milliliters

55
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,799
of microbe plus from my company bokashi

56
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,560
earthworks

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
these are the microbes the consortium

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,120
that will

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,840
ferment this and break this down into

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,879
its basic

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,878
components i'm just going to get

62
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:05,839
it's kind of messy i recommend doing

63
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:05,840
this outdoors

64
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:11,840
i feel like that's good and then one of

65
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,280
the things that you want to make sure

66
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,800
that you do is you want to make sure

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,959
that you have one of these

68
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
uh screw-on lids and you want to make

69
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,840
sure that your seal

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,360
is intact because you want to make sure

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,479
that there's no oxygen

72
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,599
in this in this mix because these are

73
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:31,280
focused anaerobes they need low or no

74
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,000
oxygen conditions to break this material

75
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,759
down and ferment

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
it properly so i'm just going to go

77
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:39,120
ahead and screw this lid on right here

78
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,239
you want to screw it on really really

79
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,360
tight

80
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,360
make sure that you get a

81
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,879
firm seal

82
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,239
and it's okay if some spills over it's

83
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,878
going to happen

84
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,000
this is going to expand as it ferments

85
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,000
so you're going to want to

86
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,840
you're going to want to crack open the

87
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,479
seal

88
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,920
maybe once a day and then you just leave

89
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,238
this

90
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,399
for 20 days it'll be completely broken

91
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,640
down and then you can extract the liquid

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,760
out of here and use it at a rate of 1000

93
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,438
to 1.

94
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,438
so there is how you make uh

95
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,079
bio biological nutrients out of cannabis

96
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:24,799
or

97
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,800
hemp green waste
