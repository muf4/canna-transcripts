13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,520
thank you for having me

14
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:48,718

do at rosin tech so we worked for rosin

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,620
tech is one of our affiliates so I work

17
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:57,479
for show labs we have a distribution and

18
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:00,328
manufacturing license in the state of

19
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,069
California under our manufacturing

20
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,260
license what I've which I directly

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,090
oversee is a rosin techlabs we produce

22
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,070
high-end live raisins ice water hashes

23
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,618
one of our main brands is rosin techlabs

24
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:17,158
so Nick mentions rosin tech rosin tech

25
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:18,629
products which produces rosin presses

26
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,630
for everything from the home user to

27
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:24,289
large-scale manufacturing was a company

28
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:26,158
that we started with and just through

29
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,390
evolution through the cannabis industry

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,430
we were finally able to get our

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,849
California license to start putting our

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,060
product onto the legal market so I head

33
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:36,839
up the manufacturing and other aspects

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,659
of shell labs

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,430
so this guys come a long way I actually

36
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,740
you know have watched him do all the

37
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,110
demonstrations since day one with rosin

38
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:48,989
tech products doing live pressing

39
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:50,879
demonstrations and it's beautiful to see

40
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:53,609
where they've come today and see this

41
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,500
guy making moves in the license world in

42
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:55,938
California they got yourself appreciate

43
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,549
it

44
00:01:55,938 --> 00:02:03,328
and all the way from Barcelona Spain

45
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:07,350
Barcelona Spain over here to my left we

46
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:09,329
have my longtime bredrin I do ed who is

47
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,219
a blue ice tech now blue ice tech

48
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,800
California is working out of cookies

49
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:18,270
Maywood and I do what are you doing over

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,390
cookies well hello guys I'm from Spain

51
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:24,000
and has telling you I'm working at

52
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:29,069
cookies right now I'm trying to figure

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,250
out what we can do there because they

54
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:35,219
don't have a non-solvent lab they was

55
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,379
doing just some solvent extracts but not

56
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:42,419
non solvent and they had like tons of

57
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:45,000
dreams sitting there on the floor just

58
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,699
trying to figure out what to do since

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,889
they realized that the solvent market is

60
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,839
going down

61
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:53,669
they thought that they have to do

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,750
something with non solvent with all this

63
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:59,669
trim so they called me to help them a

64
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,090
little bit so they brought out the big

65
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:04,519
guns so this is a new blue ice tech this

66
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,110
man's been around for a long time

67
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,230
winning multiple cannabis cups in fact

68
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,760
last year he judged spannabis in Spain

69
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:15,869
this man has been making hash this is

70
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,039
his passion and big up edu for coming

71
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,520
all the way out from Barcelona Spain

72
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,169
baggage and everytime for real and I

73
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,659
wanted each of these gentlemen on stage

74
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,519
to kind of talk about what rosin means

75
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:29,459
to them when they first learned about

76
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,469
the term rosin when you first started

77
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,900
pressing rosin some of the difficulties

78
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:37,229
you encountered what you learned and how

79
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,450
you learned it let's start with Ben over

80
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:43,469
here you know when did you first hear

81
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,909
about rosin uh so yeah we you know I

82
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:46,469
grew up on the East Coast

83
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:47,969
I'm a he's coast guy grew up in

84
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:49,229
Connecticut everyone had sure like I

85
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:51,930
might be the youngest person on the

86
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:55,829
panel here so I might be kind of like

87
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,510
new school right to the to the solvent

88
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,580
less world in cannabis right as we you

89
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:03,719
know cannabis years are like dog years

90
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,400
like seven years and one really and I

91
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,889
was making BHO just like everybody else

92
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,539
on the East Coast and I had sent a photo

93
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,089
to my friend I had some really nice kind

94
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:14,519
of like yellow shatter that we had made

95
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,189
which was kind of the in thing at that

96
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,720
point and he had text me a question back

97
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,519
I sent him this photo that was this

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,590
beautiful yellow slab and he's like he's

99
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,079
like oh is that rosin hey what the fuck

100
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:26,259
is rosin I was like you mean resin like

101
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,209
what are you talking about

102
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:29,949
and from there if you know we obviously

103
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:32,430
started to have that discussion is where

104
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:35,079
actually started to hear about Nick and

105
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,670
you know started to dive deep into all

106
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:39,069
this it was a new thing oh there's like

107
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,800
you know we didn't have to use butane on

108
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:44,259
my mother's back porch we can use just

109
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,259
heat presses and ice water hash to get

110
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:49,420
that full melt level and to actually

111
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:53,980
have it be far superior than abusing in

112
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:55,810
my opinion you know so to be up here on

113
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,710
the panel is actually I mean really

114
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,879
exciting to come that way from I mean

115
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:02,199
that may mean it seems like yesterday

116
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,209
but I want to say it was like five years

117
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,769
ago or so when you guys were starting to

118
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:08,289
blow up with putting rosin on two

119
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:10,359
different social medias and youtubes and

120
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,120
different forums you can find like

121
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,090
little really like threads of

122
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,019
information that if you knew like resin

123
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:22,149
and knew making extracts you know things

124
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:24,339
will start to pop oh shit a hair

125
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:25,870
straightener you know like there was I

126
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:28,689
mean the amount of hair straighteners we

127
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,220
went through ridiculous a lot of us

128
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:32,410
started with oral tradition a lot of

129
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,050
this started with just trying it for

130
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,430
yourself you know the hair straightener

131
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,870
tech you know and I like to bring it

132
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:43,540
back to Mila Jansen the hash Queen from

133
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:46,149
pollinator when I first started learning

134
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,740
from Mila back in the early 2000 there

135
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:50,259
was nothing written about this there

136
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,300
were a few forum posts in 2001 and

137
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:54,399
really it was about oral tradition it

138
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,410
was about going to these hash makers and

139
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,149
talking to them about their experiences

140
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,000
in Morocco and their experiences in

141
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:03,159
Europe and their experiences in India

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,990
and really just hearing what they had to

143
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,060
say that pushed me to want to learn

144
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,460
further I think that's still what it is

145
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,990
even with like jar tech right now it's

146
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:13,029
like a simple thing you throw it in the

147
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,230
jar tech but like if you're a hash guy

148
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:16,509
what solvent list like what you say

149
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:18,040
we're trying to compete with come come

150
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,230
back with like these butane guys making

151
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,730
sauce it's like you put it in a jar

152
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,410
what that's it just float it into a jar

153
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,720
and seal it for a little bit like it's a

154
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:28,210
relatively simple advancement but it's

155
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,680
like fascinating and and really not that

156
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:31,509
simple if you think about it and you

157
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,069
mentioned you know blasting butane tubes

158
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:34,569
on your backyard we all started there I

159
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:38,560
feel like you know to be completely

160
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:42,099
honest I did too you know

161
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,110
a hash 2003-2004 i bought a honeybee

162
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,540
extractor off the back of a High Times

163
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,919
Magazine little plastic looking free

164
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,660
butane cuz I heard it was the best

165
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,399
butane out there and I definitely

166
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,840
blasted butane on the back porch from my

167
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,029
house in Boulder Colorado I'm putting it

168
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:56,859
out there you know but we all started

169
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:57,789
somewhere because it tated me it taught

170
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,759
me so much

171
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:02,410
it was plastic a polymer of some of some

172
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,879
sort I don't know I'm not sure like I

173
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,150
said honey bee extractor I'm giving them

174
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,879
credit back at High Times magazines 2003

175
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:11,829
2004 but either way you know that's what

176
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,740
pushed me to want to do something else I

177
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:16,240
actually made that honey oil on the back

178
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,350
of my porch and I started giving it to

179
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,418
all my friends and my friends were

180
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,189
getting goofy like a little too fucked

181
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:23,168
up you know I was like wait what's in

182
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:25,240
this what are we doing here and I

183
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:27,609
started actually trotting to Europe and

184
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,250
I made trips to Amsterdam to learn from

185
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:33,280
Mila in fact one of the first cafes that

186
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:36,220
gave me any information as to what was

187
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,888
that product was the Bluebird Cafe

188
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,290
because back then in 2004-2005 is when

189
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:43,120
they started kind of seeing this butane

190
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,400
product of this honey oil hit the market

191
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,050
started banning it in places and there

192
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:49,019
were not a lot of people talking about

193
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,189
it there was not a lot of research done

194
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:53,889
Bluford cafe was one of the only places

195
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:55,389
that soymilk too hot you know but you

196
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:56,769
find these Henny little spots and these

197
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:58,120
people willing to talk about it there

198
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:00,009
was a scientist there that was doing

199
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,740
some testing and he was finding a ton of

200
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:05,439
heavy metals in there honey oil that was

201
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,060
on the Shelf being sold so people found

202
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,339
ways around that they started mixing the

203
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,319
honey oil with their bubble hash you

204
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:13,689
know and calling it jelly so I don't

205
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,668
know if anybody remembers jelly from mid

206
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:17,350
2000 early 2000s but there were ways

207
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:23,019
they people start around that's with

208
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:25,600
morroco hash exactly but we started

209
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:28,089
learning that the butane at that point

210
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,560
there was not enough education there was

211
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:31,119
not enough knowledge there were heavy

212
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,440
metals that we were putting into the

213
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,389
product we were concentrating those

214
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,240
heavy metals and that's what pushed me

215
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:39,580
to try and recreate that color and that

216
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,918
consistency without the use of chemical

217
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,870
solvents you know so there is value to

218
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,059
what we were doing on the back porch

219
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,649
because we were all there so I just

220
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,179
wanted to touch on that that's where

221
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:50,709
that tangent came from pick up your cell

222
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:53,809
phone

223
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,250
good yeah I actually used the the the

224
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:57,469
hottest commodity was a stainless steel

225
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,028
turkey baster and then you'd cut a

226
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,290
screen out of the back porch like you

227
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:02,120
talked about heavy metals not even

228
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,588
thinking about it could there be holes

229
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,560
out of my screen and I went the wrong

230
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:08,839
way you know we all came from somewhere

231
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,359
all right we all actually just consumed

232
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,650
some of this gentleman's hash who flew

233
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,589
all the way out here and he's utilizing

234
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:17,000
dry material we all preach fresh frozen

235
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,970
whole plant material as we were

236
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,830
mentioning and now the man's on stage so

237
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,379
I wanted him to talk a little bit about

238
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,480
what he's doing in the lab specifically

239
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:28,838
because we really have all preached this

240
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,930
whole plant fresh frozen since I learned

241
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,310
from this gentleman named Joe Petri I'm

242
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:37,219
actually gonna talk about that a little

243
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:39,169
bit further right now but Joe Petri kept

244
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,550
yelling at me being like your hash isn't

245
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:42,019
mine you know you're making it with

246
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:43,519
butan we were posting pictures on the

247
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:45,679
forums at this point getting kicked off

248
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,960
of water hash forums because our water

249
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,359
hash started looking like butane hash

250
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,740
oil it was gold and gooey and people

251
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,459
didn't believe us to be completely

252
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:58,310
honest I went to the legends of hash in

253
00:09:54,458 --> 00:10:02,689
2009 and I almost got kicked out this is

254
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:04,309
an Amsterdam and skunk man Sam's pulls

255
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,690
me aside he's like this isn't water hash

256
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:07,429
this is butane hash oil you're not

257
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,380
allowed in this contest is only for dry

258
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:12,679
seft butane hash oil and tries to kick

259
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:14,659
me and harold AKA banff extractions out

260
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,219
of legends of hash ease so there was a

261
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:18,799
lot of like trials and tribulations we

262
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,870
faced with this new technology with

263
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,549
controlling the variables of the ice and

264
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,620
the water and the input material

265
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:26,479
utilizing fresh frozen but to get back

266
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,039
to joseph Pietra he was like you don't

267
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,200
make real hash because he thought we

268
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:32,750
were making butane from our photos he's

269
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,879
like I make live hash I was like what is

270
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,289
that what does that mean live hash and

271
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,970
at that point I think I cut the guy off

272
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:40,370
I was like I'm done with this crazy kook

273
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:44,089
yelling at me on Facebook this is before

274
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:46,879
Instagram and I was like but there's

275
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:50,000
something to his live hash we had a

276
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:52,580
messed up run in 2010 around that time

277
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,470
when I was running a laboratory in a

278
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:58,100
place called pink house blooms we had

279
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,839
our own garden on site and at day 40 45

280
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,570
we started noticing some hermaphrodite

281
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,830
plants and these plants started throwing

282
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,970
pistols and throwing things

283
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,950
we didn't want to see that we didn't

284
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,019
want to bring to fruition as flowers and

285
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,310
so the boss was like yeah just do what

286
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,740
you want with that row we're gonna throw

287
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:15,109
it away it was a little early granted

288
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:18,019
but it was alive these plants were alive

289
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,810
and I was like oh it's just kook I put

290
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:21,889
this word live into my head these plants

291
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,779
are live what are we gonna do so I

292
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,850
literally took these plants I took a few

293
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:28,039
big Leafs off of them but I chopped him

294
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,840
at the root and I grabbed the base of

295
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:31,339
these plants I put them in my cold water

296
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,330
bucket and just started spinning with my

297
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,639
buddy Stephen Lewis

298
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,930
just two of us for like eight hours and

299
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,889
we took the whole row down we're like

300
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,870
fuck oh they're throwing the shit away

301
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:40,580
we're gonna just try this and we didn't

302
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,500
this wasn't fresh frozen yet but this

303
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,360
was live plants as far as we were

304
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,610
concerned took him straight from the

305
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,399
root and started mixing them and the

306
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,019
product that came from this was amazing

307
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,970
it started really really looking like

308
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:56,210
butane at that point it was really

309
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,590
really hard to handle and it became so

310
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,570
hard to handle we were like okay wait

311
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,940
let's pull it back a little bit how do

312
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:05,420
we handle these live plants and that's

313
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:08,930
really where fresh frozen came from or

314
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:11,419
live resin in the butane world live

315
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:13,309
rosin in our world there's so many

316
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:15,139
different terms that we like to touch on

317
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:18,529
and there's still a little time up here

318
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:20,689
but fresh frozen became a commodity live

319
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:23,389
whole plant fresh frozen for not only

320
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,580
the live resin guys utilizing butane but

321
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:28,279
for us solvent lists are live rosin

322
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,290
people we were able to retain a lot more

323
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:32,750
of the terpenes present in the plant

324
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:34,639
while it was growing by running it live

325
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,289
so pick up Joseph pietre if you're

326
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,179
listening out there you know it's got

327
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:39,860
love for a hater because he's the one

328
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:41,870
that flipped the switch you know and

329
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,539
that's when I started teaching Europe

330
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,820
about processing live or fresh frozen

331
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:48,769
product I feel like it's where giddy up

332
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,140
and a lot of them got that inspiration

333
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:53,659
to run their fresh frozen material in

334
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:55,610
their hydrocarbon units aka live resin

335
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:58,819
that's all family it all happened around

336
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,649
the same time in Colorado but Eddie over

337
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:04,310
here is doing magic so without further

338
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:06,559
ado no he is utilizing dry material and

339
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:09,409
I just rolled up a spliff I couldn't

340
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,179
even handle it it's still on my hands so

341
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:13,699
we want to know how you're preserving

342
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:16,120
the terpenes and you know really what

343
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,830
you've learned coming out here and

344
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,240
experiencing some of the strains that

345
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,100
were running compared to the strains

346
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,960
you've ran in Europe you know give a

347
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:27,490
little background about what you've been

348
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:37,930
doing okay um seems all of you know I'm

349
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:43,960
from Spain sorta for my bank in Spain we

350
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:48,129
smoked hash for long I think since 726

351
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:51,040
year when the Arabs came to Spain they

352
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:53,320
came with hash and also I think the word

353
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,740
hashish in is coming from that because

354
00:13:53,320 --> 00:14:02,320
they was smoking the hash before they

355
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:04,450
came to the war they were smoking hash

356
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,879
before battle yeah hashish in that's

357
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,170
where that term came from exactly so

358
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,789
he's bringing it back this is his

359
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:11,439
culture this is where we came from this

360
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:13,990
is really what we've been mimicking this

361
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,060
entire time is is this culture in this

362
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,519
generation that that came from you know

363
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:22,389
this man's hometown so bring it back for

364
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:25,990
us so we've been smoking a hash for long

365
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:28,629
and there has that we wasn't smoking it

366
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:31,419
was has mostly from Morocco from Indian

367
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:34,990
from Pakistan and the quality of that

368
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:37,299
hash now now we know that it was low

369
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,269
quality but on that moment was the early

370
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:43,299
only type of highs able to smoke so we

371
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:45,429
thought that the hash was amazing and on

372
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,708
that time we'll learn from them from the

373
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:50,259
Moroccan people that we have to smoke

374
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:53,019
with tobacco's so the way we smoked in

375
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:56,319
in Spain is with tobacco where all the

376
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:59,799
highs with the tobacco so people in

377
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,740
Spain they used to use like half gram of

378
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:04,870
hash in a joint so they smoked four or

379
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:09,399
five John's a day so two or three grams

380
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:13,629
a day so people buy hash at five ten

381
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:15,850
dollars a gram so now we have these

382
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:17,830
amazing products that we can do as you

383
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,620
say with fresh frozen whole plants but

384
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:23,110
we all have that market in Spain ready

385
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,029
to pay hundred bucks for a gram so that

386
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,399
make us a little bit difficult to

387
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:30,059
improve and to grow as a hash maker

388
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:33,269
doing top-quality six-star pros

389
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:36,659
so since the beginning I've been doing

390
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:42,269
highest just with trim and that trim was

391
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:44,669
trim from plants dry so we know that the

392
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:46,829
quality is not like when you use fresh

393
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:49,229
frozen materials because you have

394
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:52,259
mortars on that because during the dry

395
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:55,500
process you lose a lot of terms but that

396
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:56,850
was enough good for us if we compare

397
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,450
with the moroccan highs that we was

398
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:03,180
smoking before now so that's what I do I

399
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:06,600
try to do as you say magic with with

400
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:09,299
trim I try to explain to the growers

401
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,180
that they have to keep the trim fresh

402
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:14,429
they have to trim when the plan is fresh

403
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:17,549
and keep that that trim on the freezer

404
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:19,319
for me but it's a little bit her but

405
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:22,019
yeah at the beginning people was

406
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,970
throwing away that trim I was asking

407
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:26,250
them for that trim I was giving back

408
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:28,920
money or hash to them so they was really

409
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,899
happy now they realized that I'm making

410
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:32,729
money with that so they charged me they

411
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,819
charge me money for that trim so it's

412
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,769
been a little bit hard for me to do

413
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:40,860
high-quality product and be able to sell

414
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:43,860
it at a fair price for me and for the

415
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,500
customers no I think this has been an

416
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,080
issue over generations you know in

417
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,179
reality as I was mentioning you know I

418
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,370
started up in Mendo in humble humble

419
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:56,159
County where I was collecting trim off

420
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,929
the side of the road it was all dry trim

421
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,159
that the farmers didn't even want on

422
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:01,199
their property because that was just

423
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:03,509
more weight that they could possibly get

424
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,640
in trouble for and it's crazy where the

425
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:08,029
education has come you know we're where

426
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,470
we started where it was just garbage

427
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:13,740
previously and now we're turning it into

428
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:21,450
gold and really yeah it's all about

429
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:23,940
education what are your first

430
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,778
impressions of the LA like the u.s.

431
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,140
slash always

432
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:30,819
and then kind of globally what you guys

433
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,940
yeah so the question is uh what are your

434
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:36,788
first impressions on the LA scene versus

435
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,590
like the global scene and it's

436
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:41,528
interesting that you say that it's

437
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:43,389
harder for you guys to get $100 a gram I

438
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:45,609
actually want to touch this real quick

439
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,350
because in Colorado when we first

440
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:49,778
brought these solvent list products to

441
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:53,079
market I mean I was stoked if I was

442
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:57,398
getting 40 a gram so the education and

443
00:17:53,079 --> 00:18:00,970
the slim amount of amazingly protected

444
00:17:57,398 --> 00:18:03,278
and curated material has created an

445
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,509
increase and demand in this product

446
00:18:03,278 --> 00:18:06,460
along with the regulation the

447
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:08,019
over-regulation and everything else that

448
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:12,149
comes with the licensing in California

449
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:15,700
but you know to get back to the question

450
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:18,579
what is what have you noticed here in LA

451
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,519
or in the United States as the market

452
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:23,139
compared to the global market I mean

453
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,690
I've been coming to America a few times

454
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:28,110
during the last five years I used to

455
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,929
came for the expose like high times

456
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:34,509
seems like that and now that I'm here in

457
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:37,750
LA I feel like it's a little bit like

458
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:39,908
Barcelona in a Spain if we compare we

459
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,648
have a Spain that we have all these

460
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:43,870
cannabis clubs and all this cannabis

461
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:46,359
culture and we have Barcelona that is

462
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:47,949
like the center of everything now I feel

463
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,139
like a ladies a little bit the center of

464
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,269
everything here in America there's a lot

465
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,270
of market here and people ready to

466
00:18:52,269 --> 00:19:00,038
invest and ready to spend money on the

467
00:18:55,269 --> 00:19:01,210
that high quality products I agree I

468
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,429
mean especially here in the United

469
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,370
States is what we have seen is a lot of

470
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:08,200
the hype a lot of the education a lot of

471
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:09,599
these products start on the coasts

472
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,298
whether we're talking about California

473
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,490
LA San Francisco or New York you know

474
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:17,079
whether we're talking about style trends

475
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:21,460
whether we're talking about trends in

476
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:23,678
hashish trends in food coastal trends

477
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,019
are real as far as what I've experienced

478
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,390
yeah I think that that $100 a gram

479
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:31,960
hundred twenty allogram that's a very la

480
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,940
or California thing even in Colorado it

481
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,279
seems to be much cheaper than that but I

482
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:40,269
do have a question - as far as the

483
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:41,920
the European market one thing you know

484
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:44,049
I've traveled the spannabis a few times

485
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,029
into Spain Barcelona like you said is

486
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:50,500
the epicenter it's very much the LA of

487
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:52,059
Spain in regards to weed for sure but

488
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,680
there's a lot of hype you know over

489
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:55,359
California strains right there's the

490
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,670
gelato there's the cookies there's these

491
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,199
newer flavors that have come out within

492
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,570
the past ten years that people are

493
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,819
getting excited about and even over in

494
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:05,289
in Europe because California now with

495
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:07,720
the legality is a lot of people who do a

496
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:10,359
lot of Hardy but you rarely in

497
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,339
California see sativa strains there's a

498
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,679
lot of beautiful Hayes's like I'm a I'm

499
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:16,329
a haze lover at heart right I grew up in

500
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,140
the Northeast we got a lot of haze and

501
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:22,329
sours which you really don't see anymore

502
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,759
but hey is like I mean it's manageable

503
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:26,349
its traditional hashish making strains

504
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:29,259
nobody does it anymore partly because

505
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:32,049
the flowering time but like what's your

506
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:34,210
experience with washing and pressing

507
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:36,879
different types of Hayes's over there do

508
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:39,039
you or do strictly stick to like is the

509
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,170
American strains the California strains

510
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,599
the hyper in my case it may be is it a

511
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:46,720
bit particular because since I love high

512
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,980
alert if my highs is clean I like

513
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,069
everything

514
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,230
I like is I like in I like sativas I

515
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:55,240
like indicus but yeah in Spain haze is

516
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,370
really popular we didn't grow in and

517
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,180
there's a hey super Silver Haze this or

518
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:04,179
a strange from from Amsterdam that I I

519
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,950
was really love of this specialist range

520
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:10,150
but people don't like to grow that

521
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:13,330
strength with 128 that's a rarity that's

522
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:15,220
like the true Terp lover we only take

523
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:17,230
him 50 60 days what are you hearing

524
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,210
how are you yielding on him not that

525
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,450
much you know that it was done deal that

526
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:25,240
bad and they don't look really nice that

527
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,180
they're real city where they don't do

528
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:31,390
they don't do bats bro they do like

529
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:33,310
small stamps you know yeah fingers it's

530
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,380
like really special but if you are a

531
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:39,940
real connoisseur you have to like City

532
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:42,299
was a thing I do every time I every time

533
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,099
I go to Spain I'm waiting to see some

534
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:46,679
some different Hayes's in live rosin or

535
00:21:44,098 --> 00:21:48,208
full malformed I mean every time you

536
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,038
know I hate to bring it break it to you

537
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:52,558
guys but I think one of the reasons that

538
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:54,298
you guys don't see a lot of it I touched

539
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,700
on the yield but when we're talking

540
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:58,499
about yield in water hash let's bring it

541
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,319
back to the history of rosin real quick

542
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:04,069
pieces have a thick waxy cuticle

543
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:08,878
generally speaking super Silver Haze

544
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:13,168
Jack any any of those strains uh amnesia

545
00:22:08,878 --> 00:22:15,148
haze what are some of the other Hayes's

546
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:18,389
that are out there the blue Neville's

547
00:22:15,148 --> 00:22:20,248
haze there's been a few there's there

548
00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:22,528
have been a few outliers to this rule

549
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:26,368
but most of these Hayes's that I'm

550
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:28,588
seeing have a very thick waxy cuticle so

551
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:30,238
even if you're gonna yield almost enough

552
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:32,249
to make it viable when you make water

553
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:35,759
hash when you go and then press that

554
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:38,159
water hash into rosin he was talking

555
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:41,038
about 91% yields we're lucky if we see

556
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,469
40% yields on Hayes's and that's

557
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,548
something that even if you get a little

558
00:22:43,469 --> 00:22:46,919
something that might be high-quality

559
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:49,408
that wax also attributes to making

560
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,969
darker colors right you have to heat up

561
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:53,700
the temperature higher to actually

562
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:55,828
extrude the oils through the wax so less

563
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,319
the color matter the less terpenes

564
00:22:55,828 --> 00:22:59,608
higher temperatures less terpenes you

565
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,548
know there's a lot of variables that

566
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:05,878
attribute to haze is being extremely

567
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:08,908
unpopular to hash makers i feel the high

568
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:12,569
i understand the haze high but when you

569
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:14,339
break it down it's very high it's very

570
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:17,278
hard to find a haze that's gonna be

571
00:23:14,338 --> 00:23:19,708
viable you know if you sell it in flower

572
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:21,239
form it's extremely viable but when you

573
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:24,028
break it down and you're seeing one to

574
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:26,159
five percent yields after rosin it just

575
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:28,259
doesn't make it viable to send into that

576
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,539
allocated route I mentioned allocations

577
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:31,919
earlier but there are some outliers and

578
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:34,588
I do want to bring up an outlier it's

579
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,159
one of my favorite Hayes's to run ghost

580
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:40,798
train haze there's a few phenotypes that

581
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,589
do combine the haze taste but with that

582
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,388
Ghost power from the ghost OG and the

583
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:47,700
train wreck to help that trichome

584
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:49,738
production and we've been seeing things

585
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,899
that are viable we are seeing 15-20

586
00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:53,729
percent yields over 20 percent yields

587
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:55,469
they were running one called the ghost

588
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:57,750
train haze number 9 but you know

589
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,339
no numbers at this point are dictated by

590
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,720
the grover themselves so you can't say

591
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:02,308
run the ghost train nine and you're

592
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,929
gonna do great everyone's got a

593
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:05,908
different ghost train number huh number

594
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:08,100
nine but they have been able to breed

595
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:10,530
Hayes's that that taste and that feeling

596
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:12,058
in two strains that are viable and those

597
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:14,879
are the things that I'd look for the

598
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:17,460
pure Hayes's the Pure Land race Hayes's

599
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,909
are gonna be very very hard to come by

600
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,650
in water hash form or rosin form because

601
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:25,710
of the structure of the trichome and it

602
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,809
just not wanting to make water hash even

603
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:31,980
the plan is not worth it because if you

604
00:24:27,808 --> 00:24:35,009
have to wait 128 130 days flowering I

605
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,058
mean it's gonna be more expensive that

606
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:38,058
with than others

607
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:41,819
grow your own is what I say without one

608
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:44,339
lead that haze that 100 30-day haze hi

609
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:45,808
which I don't I don't discount I see

610
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:46,500
that there's a lot of people that need

611
00:24:45,808 --> 00:24:48,000
that hi

612
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,109
but it's gonna be really hard to find it

613
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,150
at a shop because it takes a lot of

614
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:52,349
energy and a lot of dedication yeah I

615
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,288
don't think you'll be seeing strains

616
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:57,029
like that a lot of what we do focus on

617
00:24:55,288 --> 00:24:58,919
let's bring it back to you know the

618
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:01,339
positive side of things I actually want

619
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,690
to hear everyone's theory on this is

620
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:06,839
I've been really focusing on strains

621
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:09,390
that are yielding viable amounts because

622
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:11,879
it helps our cultivation see that it's

623
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:15,360
it's worth it for them to give us that

624
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:18,330
flower it helps our business model right

625
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,908
so first I'm looking at that you know I

626
00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:22,678
don't want to be generalizing but I do

627
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:24,330
look at a lot of the yield data but

628
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,509
oftentimes that yield data also

629
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:30,199
attributes to higher THC a higher THC

630
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:32,640
numbers in general higher terpene

631
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,069
amounts because if you have a thinner

632
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,509
waxy cuticle you have higher terpenes

633
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:39,210
generally which is a higher yield

634
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:40,470
terpenes are heavier than waxes so

635
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,950
there's a lot of things that we look at

636
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,839
that yield helps us attribute to but I

637
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:48,538
really look at things like the yield

638
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,788
when we're talking about material

639
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:55,710
starting material to finish product

640
00:25:50,788 --> 00:25:57,658
rosin I look at the potency right that's

641
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,659
the second one and the third one is I

642
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:02,220
look at that terpene representation and

643
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:04,559
so those are the three things that I

644
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,240
look for in doing my wash is if it

645
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:07,970
doesn't hit those three things it's not

646
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,250
something that I generally want

647
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:13,009
but in those three things I want to have

648
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:15,200
very specific terpene profiles I want to

649
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:16,940
have one that's got the limonene I want

650
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,890
to have one that has that gasps the

651
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:23,330
Piney I want one that's really sugary

652
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:26,780
and so I have you know my five favorite

653
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:28,730
hash water hash aka rosin strains

654
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:32,240
strains that do really well in water

655
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:34,099
hash and do really well in rosin what

656
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,349
are some of your guys's favorite strains

657
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:38,119
I'll touch on line after what's your

658
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:42,769
favorite strain to wash right now your

659
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:45,859
top two been east coast I have to say

660
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:47,450
ages Sour Diesel that cut specifically

661
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:50,029
is like whisper my fresh frozen will

662
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:53,330
yield like six percent which is which is

663
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:54,740
beautiful from fresh frozen barbie

664
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:56,599
Karthus of anything like I mentioned

665
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,549
haze before like I'm a Terp seeker I

666
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:00,529
don't care like really what it yields I

667
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:02,359
mean at the end of the day like we all

668
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:05,089
got into it because it was for what we

669
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:07,490
wanted to consume so even like you know

670
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:08,750
I was trying to a five haze the other

671
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:12,289
day which is I could new one flowing

672
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:14,990
around had the profile and it was

673
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:17,269
amazing so that I'll give you three so

674
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:20,029
that was that was AJ's the a5 is nice

675
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:22,009
but the peanut butter cup that's been

676
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:24,649
going around is I got this gas eNOS to

677
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:26,390
it that I love yields well and again the

678
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,700
Terp I mean Terps are number one for me

679
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,250
like you go Terps are third for you

680
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,470
Terps are number one by far makes it

681
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:36,440
hard to do business fun ya know and I I

682
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:37,360
I wholeheartedly love that and I love

683
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,830
that answer

684
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,689
but how many times are you gonna get

685
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:43,970
more material from that grower you know

686
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:45,500
when he sees you know if you're doing a

687
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:47,509
trade you know it all depends on how

688
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,490
you're working but say you're spending a

689
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:51,650
certain amount of money on a pound of

690
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,539
material you know and you're getting

691
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:57,530
from that same farm you're getting one

692
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:59,809
strain that yields that 6% that AJ that

693
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:01,579
one strain that yields less than 1% it's

694
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:03,049
a rarity for sure and it's not ideal

695
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:05,689
every now and then you'll like run

696
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:07,970
something that that yields you nothing

697
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:13,039
but the end result is fire you know

698
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:14,870
shall never ever wash oh yeah how long

699
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,759
how often does it continue to come back

700
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:18,000
I guess there's two sides to personally

701
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,129
to like a business standard

702
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,049
for sure yields always a question but

703
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,030
gotta grow it yourself with that yeah

704
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:25,759
you know because the farmers not gonna

705
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:28,200
keep giving you that strain you know

706
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,970
your boss isn't gonna keep letting you

707
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,039
run that strangely he loses that money

708
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,960
yeah I think you know I think as the

709
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,549
market develops maybe they will I think

710
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,850
that you know price will start to be

711
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:41,250
dictated on the flowering cycle if it

712
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:43,169
takes on takes you 120 days for some

713
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,799
mazes to grow with that flower should we

714
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:48,810
priced more right I think develops those

715
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,589
those things might come to you know we

716
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:53,639
might be able to see those things

717
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:55,529
hopefully you know Phil what are some of

718
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,310
your favorite hash strains or rosin

719
00:28:55,529 --> 00:29:01,680
strains okay so my favorite stuff I like

720
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:04,200
to wash I definitely got to hand it to

721
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:07,200
strawberry banana that's like my hello

722
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:11,009
it might go to for R&amp;D as far as like a

723
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,809
very stable strain it's it's it's really

724
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:16,410
consistent with a lot of things that I

725
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:18,240
do and a lot of the experimenting I do

726
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:22,500
and like it's really good for everything

727
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:27,059
as far as jar tech jams you know making

728
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:29,220
wet batters like the second press method

729
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:31,409
solvent lists our mechanical separation

730
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:35,430
like making the THC a it's very high in

731
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:37,110
THC a with the greater Keane profile so

732
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,600
definitely got a hand of straw Deana but

733
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:44,069
right now one I fell in love with was

734
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:46,079
cement shoes and that's just out to me I

735
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:49,679
think it's just the terpene for profile

736
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:52,230
that gets me as well as the just the the

737
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,330
effects from it you know number one for

738
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:56,940
me as well as I'd have to agree with

739
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:58,439
then as the terpenes it's number one on

740
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,660
my list and then next is everything else

741
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,539
because I'm gonna do a dab after a dab

742
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:06,390
after dab anyways so you know it's gonna

743
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:09,240
do its job but that that terpene profile

744
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:10,350
really really got me what's the cross on

745
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,099
the cementery there's bread bite

746
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:17,369
cult-classic seeds correct I'm not a

747
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:20,399
hundred percent on it and with the

748
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:25,439
profile man the profile is like a really

749
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:27,150
gassy funky savory almost like it's

750
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,860
unique it's that's why I like it so much

751
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:31,870
because it really isn't

752
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:33,669
comparable to what's popular on the

753
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:35,409
market you know it's not GMO it's not

754
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,720
papaya it's not strawberry banana it's

755
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:40,179
it's none of those it's not just gassy

756
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,250
but it's it's super unique and I'm

757
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:45,340
that's one thing that I really love

758
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,808
about it beautiful beautiful I want to

759
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:48,159
talk about one of my strains in it and

760
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:50,529
it does touch on some of what you guys

761
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,140
just mentioned but one of my favorite

762
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:55,779
terpene profiles for a long time has

763
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,870
been the lemon rind terpene profile like

764
00:30:55,779 --> 00:31:01,178
the outside of a lemon not super Lemon

765
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:03,609
Haze which has more of like a lemon

766
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:06,370
orange cleaner type of a smell to me a

767
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:09,579
little bit more round in fruity I really

768
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:11,889
wanted like the rind of a lemon and to

769
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:13,839
me what epitomized the lot of the rind

770
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,450
of a lemon was the strain called lemon G

771
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,519
growing up it was from Ohio it was a

772
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:21,490
clone only it was really hard to get it

773
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:22,960
grew like shit it grew those fingers you

774
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,700
know you got it under a little bit too

775
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,350
hot alight I mean really you only have

776
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,900
Fox I really only wanted to grow it

777
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:30,819
under LEDs I learned eventually but that

778
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,620
thing foxtail like crazy the flowers

779
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:35,470
weren't good my hash concentrates

780
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:37,928
yielded less than 1% so I turned a whole

781
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,789
garden into concentrates and I might

782
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:43,840
have pulled like 30 grams for my head

783
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:47,019
and like lost maybe $15,000 right so

784
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:48,909
like I love terpenes right but I started

785
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:51,160
then looking towards that lemon rind

786
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:53,529
terpene and that strain called lemon

787
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,870
tree came out right and if you guys are

788
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:57,730
familiar with the lemon tree some say it

789
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:59,918
was renamed from some other things you

790
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:03,009
know but basically it had a very similar

791
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:06,009
lemon rind terpene profile I started

792
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:07,720
washing some of it maybe 1 to 3% said of

793
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:09,819
less than 1% so I was like sweet a

794
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,190
little bit higher right we got something

795
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:14,740
here so I'm still hunting this lemon

796
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:16,870
terpene profile this lemon rind and it

797
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,089
was until recently that we started

798
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:20,949
finding some of these lemon rind terpene

799
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:22,899
profiles that were actually becoming

800
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:25,058
viable you know that the farmer would

801
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,850
give to me that we're able to run that

802
00:32:25,058 --> 00:32:31,779
were yielding enough so that we didn't

803
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:33,490
have to turn that lemon flour into dried

804
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:35,649
cured flour on the shelf and the hash

805
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:38,620
maker could actually get some and so I

806
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:42,280
want a big up man like Brandon third-gen

807
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:43,750
family and men like Shiloh for breeding

808
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:46,329
the lemon bean

809
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:48,309
I know they've gone separate ways since

810
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:49,869
then but they combine help to create

811
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:51,490
that string called the lemon bean and

812
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:54,399
we've been finding specific fee knows

813
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,529
that have that same lemon rind terpene

814
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,720
profile that are actually yielding so

815
00:32:56,529 --> 00:33:00,670
that's one of my top top strains right

816
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,829
now is finding that terpene that

817
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:05,340
actually does do the work that we need

818
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:07,389
to do to keep it running through the lab

819
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:08,559
what's one of your favorite strains to

820
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,690
run right now because I smelled some

821
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:14,139
fire over I did a little tour of his

822
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:15,880
place earlier today and I know that they

823
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,890
were taking down a strain that smelled

824
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,990
ridiculous you can talk on that if you

825
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:24,180
want if you want to but what's your body

826
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:26,650
rating huh got a beta that Gary pains

827
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,090
for real though but what's your favorite

828
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:30,220
strange so far that you run over there

829
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,919
at that facility or in in general

830
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:34,390
because you've ran stuff in Europe

831
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:37,720
before Nia yeah in Spain I've been

832
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:40,480
running a lot of those widows I like

833
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,370
that that strain it deals really good at

834
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,509
least the the fennel that we have there

835
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:50,139
and if I talk about about flavors I like

836
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:53,379
GMO a lot strawberry one and I love it

837
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:58,420
and that papaya that it's been popular

838
00:33:53,380 --> 00:34:00,760
for long now I love it bro true I love

839
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,320
that both flavors I like a lot crazy too

840
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,210
you know I love that I actually just

841
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:05,799
recently followed the the trace of where

842
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,050
that papaya came from because I was so

843
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:10,059
intrigued by it now you guys you guys

844
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:12,159
are aware that the papaya strain that's

845
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:14,320
been going around its won a lot of cups

846
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,639
have you guys seen that recently can I

847
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,519
see the show hands if you guys seen

848
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,289
papaya win a cup I was intrigued by this

849
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:22,059
because a lot of the strains are new you

850
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:23,529
know like and a lot of the strains have

851
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:25,329
been around for a long time I briefly

852
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:26,409
touched on lemon tree and there's a lot

853
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,148
of people that say the lemon tree has

854
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:30,250
been around for a long time I remember

855
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:32,918
smelling that profile in Oregon you know

856
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:37,300
back in the day but it really really got

857
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:40,839
popular out of Santa Cruz but this

858
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:44,200
papaya strain I think that a lot of the

859
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:46,899
seeds originally were bred by Nirvana am

860
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:50,439
I correct in saying that Nirvana seeds

861
00:34:46,898 --> 00:34:53,829
out of Europe who is who originally bred

862
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:57,050
that papaya strain and then Oni seed co

863
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:59,090
actually got a phyno of papaya

864
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,769
from a facility that I help curate

865
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:04,160
actually I brought those seeds from

866
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:06,259
Nirvana from Amsterdam to Colorado and

867
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:08,869
just recently found out that Oni Seco

868
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,900
got that cut from my facility in

869
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:13,309
Colorado and has been continuing to

870
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,630
breed it into this couple winning

871
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:16,070
strains so it's been around for a long

872
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,680
time that stone actually came from your

873
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:20,539
backyard so you know it all starts

874
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:22,789
somewhere it's all in how you curate it

875
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:25,279
how you hold it what you're stabilizing

876
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:28,159
it with and genetics play a huge role in

877
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,490
what we're doing out there playing with

878
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:33,889
hash so I have a quick question for each

879
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:36,949
of you as starting source material do

880
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:41,559
you prefer indoor/outdoor do you like

881
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:43,609
both I like depth to be honest with you

882
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:45,440
indoors always looks great but it's a

883
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:48,950
little bit of it's like Fugazi weed

884
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,990
sometimes do you can't beat the power of

885
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:51,829
the Sun like when I first started coming

886
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:54,109
to California

887
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:55,849
my family's had farms up north and was

888
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,190
always like that we had this Sour Diesel

889
00:35:55,849 --> 00:36:00,380
that way I like an aftertaste to it that

890
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:03,139
you could taste I mean for hours after

891
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:05,150
you smoked but you just can't beat the

892
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:06,379
flavor on light depth I mean this and

893
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,539
then as far as price-wise from a

894
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,039
business standpoint like it's much more

895
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:12,590
expensive to grow indoor

896
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:15,259
I prefer light up every time but light

897
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,850
depth over full Sun what about if it's

898
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,020
light depth during a time of year that

899
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:21,920
you're having to use a lot of

900
00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:24,259
supplemental that stuff light I've made

901
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,970
a full Sun it can be tough sometimes can

902
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,490
be a little dirtier I just haven't had

903
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:29,869
in my experience you know hash makers

904
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:32,029
always good as just as only as good as

905
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:33,619
your starting material right if you

906
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:35,180
don't grow your own you're allowing a

907
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:37,460
lot of variables into there and

908
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:40,569
unfortunately I haven't I haven't had

909
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:44,869
been blessed to have a super clean clean

910
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:47,059
outdoor farm to produce like a like a

911
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:49,339
light DEP scenario and I you know I come

912
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:51,259
from when I first came to Cali and like

913
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,460
you said I saw my family had garbage

914
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,010
bags full of trim they were doing

915
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:58,190
nothing with we were never able to get

916
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:59,740
that full melt out of the outdoor but

917
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,420
lighten up every time

918
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:05,809
maybe the environmental control some of

919
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,309
that wind barriers with yeah with the

920
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:08,548
greenhouses I could always tell if your

921
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:14,458
farm was next to a road

922
00:37:08,548 --> 00:37:17,369
sure for me I'd say I prefer indoor

923
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:20,009
fresh frozen I've had a lot of

924
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:22,289
experience with like outdoor fresh

925
00:37:20,009 --> 00:37:24,599
frozen mostly mostly fresh frozen but

926
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:28,559
and I just seem to find a lot more

927
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:30,420
consistency with indoor and you know a

928
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,599
lot of it goes back to like the flower

929
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,338
rose and days and being able to you know

930
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,140
just take a small amount of weed and

931
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:38,699
press it and and see what a yield is

932
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:41,129
from there and it kind of gives you an

933
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:42,778
indicator on whether you know there's a

934
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:46,439
good resin content and if it's gonna

935
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:49,048
even be a contender for you know washing

936
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:51,178
so you know for me I really like indoor

937
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:53,849
fresh version and mostly because of the

938
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:56,608
consistency and variables and and also

939
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:58,410
like the Terp retention without like you

940
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,088
know depths I don't have a lot of

941
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,678
experience with to me I think that's

942
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:05,219
gonna be the next best thing

943
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:07,079
as far as all around but indoor you know

944
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:11,159
you don't really have much of the leaf

945
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:14,759
matter and it's just more of the turps

946
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:19,678
and less of the plant taste so that's

947
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:21,329
really like what's big for me it's hard

948
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:25,858
for me to talk about whether I prefer

949
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:29,579
full Sun prefer a greenhouse depth or

950
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:32,338
prefer indoor it's really about the

951
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:34,199
environment and whether you can control

952
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:38,880
that environment so I've actually seen

953
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:40,559
full Sun grows in desert areas like

954
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,439
Colorado that just happened to be in

955
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:45,509
this crazy valley where the Sun is

956
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:48,389
perfectly hitting the plants there's no

957
00:38:45,509 --> 00:38:50,969
wind in this valley there's no dust and

958
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:53,400
dirt being picked up to hit these trees

959
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:55,259
and some of the best hash that I've ever

960
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,900
made in my life came from this full Sun

961
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:59,818
Valley where it was just protected the

962
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,670
environment was perfect the temperature

963
00:38:59,818 --> 00:39:04,108
was right humidity was right they didn't

964
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,809
have a lot of wind because it was

965
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:09,949
protected by this valley and we got

966
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:12,269
amazing yields amazing terpene profiles

967
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:13,920
you know big up Steve down there in the

968
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:16,678
desert because it was like a one-man

969
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,999
thing you know it was crazy and that was

970
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:20,608
some of my favorite hash in the world

971
00:39:17,998 --> 00:39:22,439
that I've ever had we do see a lot more

972
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:26,400
consistency in our in

973
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,260
or operations year and year but you know

974
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,869
it's all about environment and genetics

975
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,970
to me you know I can't really decide

976
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:36,000
whether I like Depp or outdoor or indoor

977
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:37,739
more at this point it's more so

978
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,510
controlling your environment control

979
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:42,629
your genetics and me that if you can

980
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:44,160
control all the details and you can grow

981
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,690
with the Sun you don't think that the

982
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,789
quality of the trichomes

983
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:49,380
because y ou is that's why I opened up

984
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:51,029
with that was my favorite girl that full

985
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,099
Sun that was fully controlled

986
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:55,589
it's a rare situation and not many

987
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,960
farmers get that availability to have

988
00:39:55,588 --> 00:40:00,299
that valley where no wind's coming in

989
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,829
they've got the perfect Sun but yet I

990
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:06,349
don't know if the full Sun has been

991
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:06,349
replicated yet can't beat the power

992
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:11,309
people are trying every day I see a new

993
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:14,250
LED mark you know LED light on the

994
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:17,190
market each and every day I've seen

995
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:19,130
plenty of outdoor hash that you couldn't

996
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:22,108
even tell if it was indoor/outdoor

997
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:25,500
beautiful sometimes with hash I mean

998
00:40:22,108 --> 00:40:28,588
like it's just trichomes and resin right

999
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,929
it's about yields and the the terpene

1000
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:32,699
profile the flavor retention the like

1001
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:35,009
your conditions will allow you to get

1002
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:38,239
you know you guys are all touring

1003
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:40,260
globally so kind of talk about like

1004
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:45,809
different markets and what you're

1005
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:47,609
thinking about for the next year I have

1006
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:53,039
the benefit to go to a lot of places in

1007
00:40:47,608 --> 00:40:54,838
South America which is Chile yeah I've

1008
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:59,429
got I got some experience in Colombia

1009
00:40:54,838 --> 00:41:02,639
and Uruguay actually not Chile but man

1010
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:04,108
the cups everything competitions down

1011
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,989
there different there's some motor oil

1012
00:41:04,108 --> 00:41:10,469
getting pressed down there in a lot of

1013
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:13,979
cases that people are extremely happy to

1014
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:16,259
have you know and it's it's interesting

1015
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,909
to see you know a lot of the technology

1016
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,630
and advancements that have happened in

1017
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:20,848
California

1018
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:22,349
going over to Europe and stuff creating

1019
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:24,599
these higher and ice-water hashes and

1020
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:27,300
live rosin is like pee it's still

1021
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,829
foreign to even freeze any product in

1022
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,210
South America you bring it down off the

1023
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:32,789
mountain there's no freezing anything

1024
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,699
you know so you working with what you

1025
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:35,798
have and

1026
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,879
it's interesting to see how far they

1027
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:38,108
come some of the cups down they're

1028
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,150
really interesting you get you know

1029
00:41:38,108 --> 00:41:44,230
there's no live rosin there's none but

1030
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,579
some of the stuff they do with cured

1031
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,139
resin you know this is where it all came

1032
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:48,670
from what secured resin and that's what

1033
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:50,348
you're seeing in a lot of South American

1034
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:52,510
countries there's no live resins that

1035
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:54,548
we're so accustomed to to here that's

1036
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,079
the like the only thing I smoke is live

1037
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:57,818
chirping profiles I'm really excited

1038
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,390
after the show to check out some with

1039
00:41:57,818 --> 00:42:03,068
that dried material there but that's

1040
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:05,828
what's really means everybody's working

1041
00:42:03,068 --> 00:42:07,960
with cured resin and they're you know

1042
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:09,609
different strains to there's you know

1043
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,470
you'd be surprised what a border keeps

1044
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:13,420
out you know there's all you know

1045
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:16,480
there's a lot of strains the papaya

1046
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:19,450
making its way over from Europe but you

1047
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,170
know South America is is really isolated

1048
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:25,838
and with the legalities changing in

1049
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:27,430
South America and in Colombia in

1050
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:29,108
particular being poised to be a major

1051
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:31,838
player in the cannabis market I'm really

1052
00:42:29,108 --> 00:42:33,460
curious to see the strains that they

1053
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:37,058
produce for outdoor and the hashes that

1054
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:40,389
they produce I think in a lot of senses

1055
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:42,548
it'll be not as superior as the States

1056
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:43,989
or Europe but I think that we're gonna

1057
00:42:42,548 --> 00:42:46,088
see some really interesting things come

1058
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:48,189
out of there as far as mass productions

1059
00:42:46,088 --> 00:42:49,808
and and you know solvent less cartridges

1060
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:53,710
and stuff which is not necessary to have

1061
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:56,470
extremely great terpene profiles you

1062
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:58,059
know it's more about the process but how

1063
00:42:56,469 --> 00:43:00,608
much they're able to do down there is

1064
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:03,069
exciting and you know the u.s. never

1065
00:43:00,608 --> 00:43:05,769
stops innovating so one of the things I

1066
00:43:03,068 --> 00:43:08,289
wanted to touch on real quick is the the

1067
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:10,480
vastness and maybe it might not be the

1068
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:13,108
highest quality production but let's

1069
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,510
just start from the seed what I've seen

1070
00:43:13,108 --> 00:43:17,980
happen in Morocco and in Spain in places

1071
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,349
like Valencia where a lot of the

1072
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,599
breeders are actually doing the bulk of

1073
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:25,690
the breeding for the United States for

1074
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:27,818
Europe is the seed selection is amazing

1075
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:31,510
they're able to pop a lot more seeds in

1076
00:43:27,818 --> 00:43:32,980
Fino hunt to a capacity that I haven't

1077
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:35,260
been able to see in the United States

1078
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:37,659
and so that's one of the main advantages

1079
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:40,150
that I've seen from my travels around

1080
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:42,759
the world is the ability to Fino hunt on

1081
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:45,338
a really really specific finite level

1082
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,360
because you can pop that many more seeds

1083
00:43:45,338 --> 00:43:49,940
in places like valensa

1084
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:53,240
in places like Morocco I'm excited to

1085
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,889
see the this ice water hash market in

1086
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:56,329
Europe as you were saying that's the

1087
00:43:54,889 --> 00:43:58,309
only thing Europe's ever smoked is ice

1088
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:59,840
water hash and spliffs that'll be the

1089
00:43:58,309 --> 00:44:01,789
hugest market for ice water hash which

1090
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,010
is my personal favorite of concentrates

1091
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:06,440
its most unadulterated form of trike

1092
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,270
heads or resin I think that's gonna be a

1093
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,980
huge huge product as far as live and

1094
00:44:08,269 --> 00:44:11,869
everything as far as the market develops

1095
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,750
really excited for Europe and Spain

1096
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:17,420
Amsterdam we're seeing I mean we have a

1097
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:20,119
lot of corrosion in Spain because as I

1098
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:22,280
told you we have big high school tour

1099
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:24,259
and there's a small amount of people

1100
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,110
that they really love top-quality and

1101
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:30,080
they are pushing and helping us to to be

1102
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:31,849
able to do high quality products oh yeah

1103
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,059
and also there's a lot of people now

1104
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:37,429
from England that they are introducing

1105
00:44:35,059 --> 00:44:39,559
themselves to non-solvent extracts and

1106
00:44:37,429 --> 00:44:42,710
they have money and they are ready to

1107
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:44,239
pay for high quality products so for

1108
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:48,110
sure I think the community is gonna grow

1109
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:50,419
in Spain and in Europe a quick question

1110
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:54,769
in the traditional hash producing

1111
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:56,809
countries are they still doing like dry

1112
00:44:54,769 --> 00:44:59,500
like traditional methods or they all

1113
00:44:56,809 --> 00:45:01,820
like rocking the washing machines and

1114
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,860
that's a great question or a mix of the

1115
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:06,160
two and it is there is there a future

1116
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:09,860
for dry so the thing for us it's like

1117
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:12,469
it's been really hard to try to make

1118
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:14,030
them understand about quality because

1119
00:45:12,469 --> 00:45:15,859
they've been doing in Morocco for

1120
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:17,930
example they've been doing hash for a

1121
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:21,260
long time okay they've been doing tons

1122
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:22,940
of money every season and when you go

1123
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,740
there and you explain them that they

1124
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:27,619
have to do it in a different way to do

1125
00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:29,809
it more clean they've realized that at

1126
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:32,719
the end of the season they have 10

1127
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:35,449
tonnes less than last year and they ask

1128
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:37,609
you who is gonna pay for these ten tons

1129
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:39,379
less so they don't really care about

1130
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:42,470
quality they care about money

1131
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:44,740
so of course hash from Morocco becomes

1132
00:45:42,469 --> 00:45:47,480
more more pure right now because

1133
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:50,089
European people is going there to train

1134
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,179
them but it's gonna be really hard for

1135
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:56,150
them to change what they are doing for

1136
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:57,919
hundreds and hundreds of years extremely

1137
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:59,180
difficult but at the same time we have

1138
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,568
seen

1139
00:45:59,179 --> 00:46:05,480
friends of ours bring freeze dryers to

1140
00:46:02,568 --> 00:46:07,489
Morocco yeah that's true so technology

1141
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:11,389
is changing and they are accepting of

1142
00:46:07,489 --> 00:46:13,669
some new technology right and some of

1143
00:46:11,389 --> 00:46:15,768
the hash that I've seen come out of

1144
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,778
Morocco in the last two years since the

1145
00:46:15,768 --> 00:46:19,639
freeze dry our technology is come into

1146
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:21,498
play they're using generators to power

1147
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:23,838
freeze dryers in the middle of Morocco

1148
00:46:21,498 --> 00:46:25,338
right like this is real okay

1149
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:27,558
and some of the hash that I've seen is

1150
00:46:25,338 --> 00:46:30,798
fucking amazing bro we bring some of my

1151
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:33,980
favorite house barracks freezer freezer

1152
00:46:30,798 --> 00:46:35,809
tracks to Morocco from Spain to do a

1153
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:38,690
hygiene side because we might have to

1154
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:42,470
stop the car I think we work at Mountain

1155
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:44,749
Grove nothing so yeah it's crazy that

1156
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:46,248
we're trying to today they've third they

1157
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:48,379
are fighting it we've seen the same

1158
00:46:46,248 --> 00:46:50,838
thing in Jamaica when dabbing first

1159
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:52,338
became popular and I went to Jamaica you

1160
00:46:50,838 --> 00:46:54,558
know they saw the torch and they were

1161
00:46:52,338 --> 00:46:57,018
like nah we don't do crack man no we

1162
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:58,940
don't smoke out a pipe Rasta nom on my

1163
00:46:57,018 --> 00:47:01,159
smoked spliff peer spliff well I mean

1164
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:03,200
you know and so the first time we

1165
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:05,179
brought that that technology in that

1166
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:07,489
culture to Jamaica they were scared you

1167
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:09,768
know and I think that the email and

1168
00:47:07,489 --> 00:47:11,449
advents like that have have helped and

1169
00:47:09,768 --> 00:47:13,548
you know really the education that we

1170
00:47:11,449 --> 00:47:14,808
pushed have have helped as well and the

1171
00:47:13,548 --> 00:47:16,730
same thing that we're gonna be seeing in

1172
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:18,710
Morocco we started showing them what we

1173
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:20,179
can do with a freeze dryer and what we

1174
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,909
can do with their material that they're

1175
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:26,210
going what strains we can bring into

1176
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:27,858
their growing technologies and we are

1177
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,989
starting to see some slight changes in

1178
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:32,480
that realm just displaying a little bit

1179
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:34,099
what's going on in Morocco in Morocco

1180
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,679
they have few problems the main one is

1181
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:38,720
that they they are growing on the same

1182
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:41,179
land for hundreds and hundreds of years

1183
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:43,338
so the land the soil is dead totally

1184
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:46,399
dead so they've been using chemical

1185
00:47:43,338 --> 00:47:50,239
products to feed the plants so that the

1186
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:53,298
soil is dead and full of salts so the

1187
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:55,369
heel of the plant is really low so the

1188
00:47:53,298 --> 00:47:57,528
quality becomes from the plan and if

1189
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:58,220
your plans are shitty the Hajj is going

1190
00:47:57,528 --> 00:48:00,588
to be shitty

1191
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:04,998
you can clean you can use freeze-dried

1192
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:07,578
machines but when you grow a lamp you

1193
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:11,778
cannot control all these small details

1194
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:13,100
that we control here and as you know has

1195
00:48:11,778 --> 00:48:15,380
is something that

1196
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:17,690
you're doing a small batches when you

1197
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,180
try to do big batches the quality is

1198
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:22,490
it's going down it's really hard to

1199
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:24,529
control all the small details that you

1200
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:27,319
have to control it that's my opinion so

1201
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:30,260
I hope that everything is gonna change

1202
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:34,420
in Morocco but it's gonna be really slow

1203
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:37,700
really really slow it's happening slowly

1204
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:40,250
all right we have to think about how you

1205
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:43,579
move all these highs from Morocco to

1206
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:46,309
Europe in all this process there's no

1207
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:47,750
temperature your highs it's gonna be

1208
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:50,389
fucked up because the temperature

1209
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:52,849
because the time that you need to move

1210
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:55,099
this hash for more over to Europe so

1211
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:58,610
it's not that easy and Moroccan hash

1212
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:59,690
traditionally is a dry sip - yeah you're

1213
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:01,160
saying they're bringing freeze dryers

1214
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:02,840
there they doing I sell a lot of ice

1215
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:04,489
water hash and things there no moles

1216
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,170
ashes has he mentioned I'm really

1217
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:06,859
excited as Peter touched on as far as

1218
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:08,389
dry seft

1219
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,010
you know I mean ice water hash and

1220
00:49:08,389 --> 00:49:12,079
Rosen's have come a long way for sure

1221
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:14,900
what we've kind of forgot about dry cept

1222
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,480
guys like Cuban are making super full

1223
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,700
melt type of dry seft which is an even

1224
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:23,000
more unadulterated form of resin head

1225
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:24,739
than even ice water hash to a sense and

1226
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,070
with like static and this different

1227
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:29,449
technology I think that that's gonna be

1228
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:31,670
from a commercial production standpoint

1229
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:34,039
which is like California is all about

1230
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:36,130
you know can we scale it is like the

1231
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:38,659
most popular question you get asked

1232
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:42,890
driveshaft is like has enormous

1233
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:44,839
potential yeah I'm like it III like I

1234
00:49:42,889 --> 00:49:46,309
like I like parts of it I don't like it

1235
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,930
as much as ice water hash I don't quite

1236
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:49,759
think it's there I don't know what but

1237
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:51,169
it's exciting as far as like creating a

1238
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,000
new time although as I think we know

1239
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:55,550
that what it is a solvent will lose

1240
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,650
something on the water but something

1241
00:49:55,550 --> 00:50:00,080
happened on the water process that the

1242
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:01,970
quality that you have at the end I feel

1243
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,250
that this bird and the dry season yeah

1244
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:06,769
it's cleaner for sure and I feel like a

1245
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,840
lot of this is the strains and the

1246
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:10,940
variables because in reality I think to

1247
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,190
get enough of the yield and to collect

1248
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:15,440
those heads those heads have to harden

1249
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:17,000
out when we're talking about dry so the

1250
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,710
heads don't have to fully have to harden

1251
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,119
when we're talking about water hash so I

1252
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:21,889
think we're able to retain a lot of

1253
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:23,690
those water soluble terpenes

1254
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:25,368
when we're making water hash

1255
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:29,150
compared to dry sift which those

1256
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:31,220
terpenes are falling off in the air to

1257
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:35,300
the environment because to enable to

1258
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:37,489
make to make sift you do have to harden

1259
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:42,170
out those heads now we've seen some some

1260
00:50:37,489 --> 00:50:44,000
frozen sift some fresh sift but I don't

1261
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:47,210
know if the yields are gonna make it

1262
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,389
past that hash maker that's that's about

1263
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,949
you I've seen freeze-dried sift like

1264
00:50:50,389 --> 00:50:53,598
freeze-dried flowers and sift and I've

1265
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:55,129
heard of people doing that I'm just not

1266
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,019
too sure on the yield and stuff like

1267
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:58,130
that this is what we wanted to get into

1268
00:50:57,019 --> 00:50:59,838
in the history of rosin we were gonna

1269
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:01,460
explain what we've seen in the past and

1270
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:03,409
we want it's up to you guys to keep

1271
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:05,210
educating and keep trying these

1272
00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:08,269
different things play with some frozen

1273
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:13,550
sift post some freeze dryer sift you

1274
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:18,469
know keep playing so you guys were

1275
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:19,910
mentioning the terpenes and yield are

1276
00:51:18,469 --> 00:51:24,469
very important to you when choosing

1277
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:26,929
which strains to press but I was

1278
00:51:24,469 --> 00:51:30,259
wondering also how important in terms of

1279
00:51:26,929 --> 00:51:32,629
terpenes are the medical aspects or the

1280
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:34,520
medical benefits of each strain going

1281
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:37,369
into that and what they will be useful

1282
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:41,059
for in terms of when deciding what to

1283
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:43,338
make well a lot of this is unknown you

1284
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:45,409
know and a lot of this is just us

1285
00:51:43,338 --> 00:51:48,380
playing with these different things and

1286
00:51:45,409 --> 00:51:50,480
doing R&amp;D because for the longest time

1287
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:53,180
we haven't been able to do research on

1288
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:56,300
paper this is still a federally illegal

1289
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:58,338
product that we're talking about but we

1290
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:00,589
actually do mention terpenes because I

1291
00:51:58,338 --> 00:52:03,799
personally highly believe that terpenes

1292
00:52:00,588 --> 00:52:05,900
have a huge benefit in the actual

1293
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,640
interaction how they make you feel you

1294
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,500
know I go back to the analogy of an

1295
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:11,568
orange when you crack an orange

1296
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:13,550
generally most people are gonna smile

1297
00:52:11,568 --> 00:52:15,289
when you open an orange and that's a

1298
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:17,539
terpene that's present that's making you

1299
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:20,029
feel that specific way I think there's a

1300
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:22,219
lot of value in the terpenes combined

1301
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:24,200
with the specific cannabinoids to make

1302
00:52:22,219 --> 00:52:27,529
you feel a certain way or help or

1303
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:28,759
benefit a specific effect do you guys

1304
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:31,760
want to touch on some of the things you

1305
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,530
guys have witnessed yeah you know THC

1306
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,300
cannabis is actually classified as like

1307
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,890
a psychedelic right and it does have

1308
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,329
psychedelic qualities

1309
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:39,858
and anybody who's experienced with

1310
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:44,900
psychedelics you're set in setting right

1311
00:52:39,858 --> 00:52:48,679
and how you experience the power of THC

1312
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:50,420
is pure is is very much dictated on your

1313
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:54,169
mindset going into it and a little bit

1314
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:55,579
of some what aromatherapy and and how

1315
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,559
that strains smelled you just like you

1316
00:52:55,579 --> 00:52:59,568
like certain foods that make you happy

1317
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:01,910
and certain foods don't the terpenes

1318
00:52:59,568 --> 00:53:03,920
have a big aspect on your set and

1319
00:53:01,909 --> 00:53:06,139
setting on creating a positive

1320
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,150
experience to start where the

1321
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:10,759
psychoactive components of cannabis

1322
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:16,338
start to affect you you're you're in a

1323
00:53:10,759 --> 00:53:19,489
better place subconsciously almost yeah

1324
00:53:16,338 --> 00:53:22,998
no I agree I mean I think I mean the way

1325
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:25,999
I look at it is THC is the the road and

1326
00:53:22,998 --> 00:53:28,009
terpenes are the driver you know so and

1327
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:30,139
you know we're all not gonna feel the

1328
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:33,409
same off of each strain or the terpene

1329
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:35,118
profiles but I think it's it's like Ben

1330
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:37,219
was saying it really does have a lot to

1331
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:42,789
do with your mindset going into it you

1332
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:45,409
know and just you know your overall

1333
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:46,999
feeling you know I think it's just we're

1334
00:53:45,409 --> 00:53:49,670
all gonna find what strains we like in

1335
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:51,348
the way we feel and you know it's

1336
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:52,579
getting to a point where with with the

1337
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:55,220
extraction and stuff you know we're

1338
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:56,778
separating the terpenes from the THC so

1339
00:53:55,219 --> 00:53:58,788
you know now we're able to concentrate

1340
00:53:56,778 --> 00:54:00,679
the terpene profiles and the THC

1341
00:53:58,789 --> 00:54:02,569
profiles so you know it's definitely

1342
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:05,739
changing and I think that's gonna be a

1343
00:54:02,568 --> 00:54:08,630
lot of R&amp;D and observation with you know

1344
00:54:05,739 --> 00:54:10,400
us trying it and figuring out you know

1345
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:12,200
how we like it like for me for instance

1346
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,400
you know when we remove the terpenes and

1347
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:15,919
you just have THCA

1348
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:17,298
I had fun with it you know I dabbed it

1349
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,039
I'm not a big fan of it I don't really

1350
00:54:17,298 --> 00:54:21,288
like the way it makes me feel you know I

1351
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:23,239
get really high yeah but I just don't

1352
00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:25,910
like the overall high from it you know

1353
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:28,068
but you know if I do a hit up THC a and

1354
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:31,399
then I do like a nice herpe dab maybe

1355
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:33,349
two and it's definitely you know it's

1356
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,559
it's way more relaxing and it's just

1357
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:40,338
more of a direction you know rather than

1358
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:42,859
an anxiety or you know just stuck in

1359
00:54:40,338 --> 00:54:45,139
your mind thinking crap you don't want

1360
00:54:42,858 --> 00:54:46,639
her you know I think terpenes give you a

1361
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:48,980
feeling you know you when you want to

1362
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:52,489
relax you buy things with lavender and

1363
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:55,280
you know like it's it's it's Terps

1364
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:58,009
definitely are they dictate the way we

1365
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,250
feel and I think THC just boosts us up

1366
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:04,280
there so a combination of all of those

1367
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:05,570
cannabinoids is really important one

1368
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,970
more thing to briefly touch on the

1369
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:10,309
medicinal aspect and why we all talk

1370
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:12,469
about terpenes so much is a good example

1371
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:15,619
is most of these strains that we're

1372
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:17,739
finding extremely high in CBD aka

1373
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:21,440
strains that are classified as hemp or

1374
00:55:17,739 --> 00:55:23,959
drug variety hemp strains like ac/dc

1375
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,909
strains like Harlequin strains like the

1376
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,769
cherry or cherry wine and all these

1377
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:30,789
cherry crosses that we're seeing now in

1378
00:55:27,769 --> 00:55:35,449
the CBD world canna tonic

1379
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:38,449
those strains all have a very high beta

1380
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:42,259
Carol awfully no file that's the terpene

1381
00:55:38,449 --> 00:55:44,989
that's extremely present in that series

1382
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,070
of strains in all these CBD strains

1383
00:55:44,989 --> 00:55:48,078
we're seeing now we're starting to see a

1384
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:50,329
fused outliers we're seeing the bubba

1385
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:53,060
pushes that are testing is hemp which in

1386
00:55:50,329 --> 00:55:57,560
reality hemp is just anything that's 0.3

1387
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:59,420
THC and less or less THC that's what's

1388
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:01,519
being classified as hemp but what we're

1389
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:03,470
seeing in most of these heme strains

1390
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:05,509
like I said there are outliers we are

1391
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:07,578
finding CBD and strains that don't have

1392
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:10,369
this terpene profile but for the longest

1393
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:14,000
time those strains had that cherry or

1394
00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:16,220
that cherry cough syrup flavor which was

1395
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,139
associated with bethe Kerala flame beta

1396
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:20,358
care Laughlin is also the smell you're

1397
00:56:18,139 --> 00:56:22,909
finding in anise and black pepper and

1398
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:24,500
some black pepper if you look in the

1399
00:56:22,909 --> 00:56:26,779
history and what those things can do

1400
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,039
those smells those the terpenes that

1401
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,890
come from an ism black pepper are

1402
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:33,710
they're good for anti-inflammation the

1403
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:36,549
same thing that we're seeing CBD is good

1404
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:38,539
for so I think that there's a lot of

1405
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:41,690
analogies and things that we're gonna

1406
00:56:38,539 --> 00:56:45,250
find and amazing combinations between

1407
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:47,929
the terpenes and their counterplay

1408
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:51,440
cannabinoids that do some amazing things

1409
00:56:47,929 --> 00:56:53,989
for the medicinal aspect I was going to

1410
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,059
say I think that cherry taste is the CBD

1411
00:56:53,989 --> 00:56:58,759
in my opinion I got to agree with that

1412
00:56:56,059 --> 00:57:00,588
actually you know when you isolated like

1413
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,820
I played around with isolated CBT too

1414
00:57:00,588 --> 00:57:04,279
and smoking and

1415
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:06,019
and just find that heavy cherry taste

1416
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,930
with it I think that's where the the

1417
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:11,989
name was coined 100% yeah what's that

1418
00:57:08,929 --> 00:57:15,219
terpene I don't think there's terpenes

1419
00:57:11,989 --> 00:57:17,989
at that point yeah it tastes like cherry

1420
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:21,259
that out that exhale you taste a

1421
00:57:17,989 --> 00:57:22,579
predominant cherry I still think that

1422
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:26,180
it's terpenes that are left in there

1423
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:27,409
what else provides a flavor because I

1424
00:57:26,179 --> 00:57:28,940
don't think a molecule is gonna have a

1425
00:57:27,409 --> 00:57:30,799
flavor at that point but I could be

1426
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,170
wrong you know it's just what I've

1427
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:36,680
noticed over over generations whenever

1428
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:39,619
I've tried CBD when we extracted CBD

1429
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:42,139
from Ryan Laughlin farm in Colorado we

1430
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:44,179
got that same flavor and what I've been

1431
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:46,309
seeing in history is that flavor is

1432
00:57:44,179 --> 00:57:48,799
associated with you know that black

1433
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:52,099
pepper anise type flavor the anise is

1434
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:54,320
very cherry like that black pepper anise

1435
00:57:52,099 --> 00:57:56,000
beta-carotene which has been known for

1436
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,750
anti-inflammation I just think that

1437
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,849
there's going to be a lot of

1438
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,900
correlations between the terpenes and

1439
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:02,089
the cannabinoids and that's what we're

1440
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:05,740
gonna be fine-tuning as we move into the

1441
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:05,740
future and what rosin holds for us

1442
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:14,900
there's a few then out there nice but

1443
00:58:12,219 --> 00:58:16,519
it's definitely not as exciting that's

1444
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,740
for sure we've done some awesome

1445
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:22,039
demonstrations that appear like we're

1446
00:58:18,739 --> 00:58:24,259
running cannabis THC heavy strains we're

1447
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:26,750
washing it it's turning out to be a pure

1448
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:28,820
gold color we're pressing it live we did

1449
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:30,440
one at the endo Expo that people were

1450
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:32,720
like how are you guys running weed out

1451
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:35,599
here you know like live you know it's

1452
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:36,829
it's hemp however said have I think

1453
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,619
we're actually gonna be doing one

1454
00:58:36,829 --> 00:58:41,630
together at the dabba-doo around Miami

1455
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:44,119
I'm doing some things out there with

1456
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:45,410
some hemp that looks like cannabis as

1457
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:47,509
I'm saying there's a lot of cush

1458
00:58:45,409 --> 00:58:50,029
varieties coming out that are washing

1459
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:52,070
well it's smell amazing that smelled

1460
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:53,390
like your bubba kush that you're seeing

1461
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,950
at the dispensary shelf so there's

1462
00:58:53,389 --> 00:58:57,079
things changing everyday I'm excited

1463
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:58,819
it's late but I to start soon I think to

1464
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:02,869
get specific with that question with the

1465
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:07,370
tens of thousands of acres of flavorful

1466
00:59:02,869 --> 00:59:10,009
smelling hemp farm flour do you think

1467
00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:11,389
there's gonna be a market for just like

1468
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:14,000
there's a market for smokeable flour

1469
00:59:11,389 --> 00:59:15,409
some farmers are growing for those

1470
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,630
varieties some

1471
00:59:15,409 --> 00:59:19,308
farmers are still running a bunch of

1472
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:20,990
seed crops trying to figure it out but I

1473
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:23,420
think it's definitely going towards

1474
00:59:20,989 --> 00:59:25,909
running for specific allocations whether

1475
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:27,409
you're growing for smokeable varieties

1476
00:59:25,909 --> 00:59:29,358
where they're growing for topical or

1477
00:59:27,409 --> 00:59:31,429
they're growing for extraction purposes

1478
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:32,869
well also I mean talk about allocations

1479
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:34,639
when you have a lot of hemp farms out

1480
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:37,730
there you're talking a KERS and acres

1481
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:40,159
and acres of cannabis at the end of the

1482
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:41,869
day hemp is cannabis right a hard time

1483
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:44,568
calling it HAP it's the same thing just

1484
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:46,640
no THC you like Nick said but who's

1485
00:59:44,568 --> 00:59:49,038
gonna have I mean you have 20 acres of

1486
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:51,318
hemp who wants to freeze all of that you

1487
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:54,589
know what I mean they're dried in barns

1488
00:59:51,318 --> 00:59:57,588
and and and dried with much less care

1489
00:59:54,588 --> 00:59:59,509
than THC is so to get high-quality

1490
00:59:57,588 --> 01:00:02,150
solvent less at the end of the day is a

1491
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:04,460
little bit harder you can save part of

1492
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:06,829
that crop if you wanted to to make a

1493
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:08,298
live rosin CBD and I'm sure it would

1494
01:00:06,829 --> 01:00:10,220
come out amazing but the amount of

1495
01:00:08,298 --> 01:00:12,440
people doing that are very very minimal

1496
01:00:10,219 --> 01:00:13,730
if anybody I hope to see that in the

1497
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:16,639
future and I think we I think we

1498
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:19,400
absolutely will again as the markets

1499
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:20,838
tend to mature we will see that but

1500
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,119
right now I don't know if anybody's

1501
01:00:20,838 --> 01:00:26,929
doing that thanks for changing because

1502
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:30,680
we went from growing average of 7% CBD

1503
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:32,989
hemp crops when AG first certified hemp

1504
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:36,379
facilities in Colorado and now we're

1505
01:00:32,989 --> 01:00:39,229
Fino selecting for putting clones out

1506
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:41,390
and putting seeds out of over 20 30 %

1507
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:43,278
CBD crops and those are going out there

1508
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:45,618
to produce CBD isolate which is

1509
01:00:43,278 --> 01:00:47,778
concentrate you know and CBD distillate

1510
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:49,309
so I think it's definitely out there now

1511
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:51,380
we're seeing the smokeable varieties

1512
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:53,269
people pulling public push and the cush

1513
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:56,838
varieties coming out of Southern Oregon

1514
01:00:53,269 --> 01:00:59,960
right now are pretty spectacular so just

1515
01:00:56,838 --> 01:01:03,078
to bring it back like Ben said hemp is

1516
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:06,048
cannabis it's just testing below 0.3

1517
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:08,750
percent THC people are breeding now for

1518
01:01:06,048 --> 01:01:12,278
trichome production of CBD we're

1519
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:15,048
breeding for THC production since

1520
01:01:12,278 --> 01:01:17,119
hundreds of years ago right really going

1521
01:01:15,048 --> 01:01:18,980
after it since what the 50s or 60s

1522
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:21,048
that's just starting to happen now with

1523
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:22,909
CBD so I mean and give it five ten years

1524
01:01:21,048 --> 01:01:24,710
we'll see some really cool stuff we

1525
01:01:22,909 --> 01:01:25,879
almost lost CBD because people are like

1526
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:28,190
oh this stuff's not getting me high

1527
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,269
we're not gonna get that one you know so

1528
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:31,490
we almost lost it

1529
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:32,780
for regulation so we do have to give

1530
01:01:31,489 --> 01:01:35,239
thanks to regulation and some

1531
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:37,280
over-regulation for allowing us to test

1532
01:01:35,239 --> 01:01:40,759
all these products we literally almost

1533
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:43,550
lost CBD because lack of testing and

1534
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:46,520
lack of the ability to you know

1535
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:49,340
protected while testing so so I kind of

1536
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:53,119
have a two-part question and you kind of

1537
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:56,930
touched on it earlier how important are

1538
01:01:53,119 --> 01:02:01,009
the smoking devices consumption devices

1539
01:01:56,929 --> 01:02:03,679
to the expansion of your market and

1540
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:06,380
bringing new people in to enjoy these

1541
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:10,069
types of concentrates nude a Briggs ear

1542
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:13,039
IG's opening up the market to people how

1543
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:17,559
important is that and for each one of

1544
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:22,429
you do you have a device that you feel

1545
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:25,820
perfectly expresses the concentrate the

1546
01:02:22,429 --> 01:02:27,919
experience for you are there devices

1547
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:31,370
that are inferior what is the best

1548
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:33,320
method for each one of you maybe I'm not

1549
01:02:31,369 --> 01:02:38,690
the best to us to answer that question

1550
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:40,730
because I mixed with tobacco I've been

1551
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:45,409
trying to find another way to smoke

1552
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:47,630
without tobacco probably because that

1553
01:02:45,409 --> 01:02:49,460
heat that comes from the tobacco I don't

1554
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:51,320
quit and I like that I don't smoke

1555
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:53,510
cigarettes I just smoke tobacco with my

1556
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:56,930
joints but I've been trying a lot of

1557
01:02:53,510 --> 01:03:01,250
device and finally the only one that I

1558
01:02:56,929 --> 01:03:03,949
like is the puff copic in my opinion it

1559
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:07,099
works really good I used to smoke rose

1560
01:03:03,949 --> 01:03:09,889
in on on the Pascoe Peaks and I'm not

1561
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:13,069
gonna join and I think that that's my

1562
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:14,480
favorite I love hearing that I love

1563
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:16,460
hearing that you know like I mentioned

1564
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,340
one of the scariest things about

1565
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:21,260
promoting dabs when they first came to

1566
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:24,440
the industry into the community to the

1567
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:26,960
world was the torch you know in reality

1568
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:29,210
in explaining to a lot of folks we are

1569
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:32,289
in a different generation that this

1570
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:34,720
torch is for healthy purposes

1571
01:03:32,289 --> 01:03:36,969
you know inhaling something via

1572
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:38,649
vaporization rather than combusting it

1573
01:03:36,969 --> 01:03:40,629
there were a lot of things that it were

1574
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:41,380
really really hard to explain so I do

1575
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:43,838
agree with that

1576
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:45,670
I believe that devices like the puff

1577
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:50,380
coke peak and there's so many other

1578
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:52,740
devices coming out now the cart GPN just

1579
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:54,880
put out a new device there's a ton of

1580
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:57,129
electronic dabbing devices that are

1581
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,108
coming out to market that are a lot

1582
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:01,838
safer than utilizing a torch for dabbing

1583
01:03:59,108 --> 01:04:03,309
and that are a lot easier to travel with

1584
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:07,480
a lot more portable much more

1585
01:04:03,309 --> 01:04:10,358
approachable I've taken to answer your

1586
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:12,699
question I prefer a rig a quartz nail

1587
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:14,980
and a torch every time there's nothing

1588
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:17,319
really that you you really cannot to

1589
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:18,820
implicate that what I actually think one

1590
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,710
of the coolest tools and I wasn't into

1591
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:22,599
it at first is the turbo meter that came

1592
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:23,650
out to measure the actual temperature of

1593
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:25,720
the nail I took it

1594
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:27,519
dab dude a little while ago that was

1595
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:29,289
really like never do it without that now

1596
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:30,940
because you get the exact time but I

1597
01:04:29,289 --> 01:04:32,469
think one of the most instrumental

1598
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,039
things and making dabbing more

1599
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:35,559
approachable

1600
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,900
I've dabbed with my grandmother on the

1601
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:39,699
electrical devices you know who's she's

1602
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:41,320
almost 80 years old she like sweet but

1603
01:04:39,699 --> 01:04:43,389
well I only ever smoke joints and I get

1604
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,970
to tell her you know the new

1605
01:04:43,389 --> 01:04:48,549
appreciation you know we all have for

1606
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:53,079
for hash and rosin now which has come I

1607
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:54,789
mean many you know it's come a long way

1608
01:04:53,079 --> 01:04:57,579
let's say since her time was smoking ash

1609
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:59,259
but a puffs go or a Carta you know for

1610
01:04:57,579 --> 01:05:00,969
to put that in front of her was so much

1611
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:03,339
more approachable and to take this

1612
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:05,108
generation who you know sees a torsion

1613
01:05:03,338 --> 01:05:07,650
thinks you know really hardcore drugs

1614
01:05:05,108 --> 01:05:10,900
that's really been the biggest

1615
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:13,030
revelation and leap in the industry but

1616
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:15,220
I don't think that as far as flavor wise

1617
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:17,200
and what we're searching for on extracts

1618
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:19,959
particularly solvent this is is it's not

1619
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:21,279
matched with a nail and a torch I want

1620
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,470
to touch on that real quick just because

1621
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,089
he mentioned something and you mentioned

1622
01:05:23,469 --> 01:05:27,219
something that's it's been coming up a

1623
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:29,710
lot recently you mentioned that your

1624
01:05:27,219 --> 01:05:32,709
favorite thing is a torch with a timer

1625
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:35,740
and for me this whole time earthing has

1626
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:37,449
been interesting because all nails are

1627
01:05:35,739 --> 01:05:39,098
different all environments are different

1628
01:05:37,449 --> 01:05:41,679
so you take that same nail in your same

1629
01:05:39,099 --> 01:05:43,300
dag rib that you're normally torching at

1630
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:44,710
minute and 20 seconds but you take it

1631
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:47,530
outside in your backyard and that time

1632
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:50,559
were completely changes right minute 20

1633
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:52,420
to 50 seconds right so so there's been

1634
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,309
some variables there that have confused

1635
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:57,430
me a little bit what you just mentioned

1636
01:05:54,309 --> 01:06:00,880
this new device this Terp timer turbo

1637
01:05:57,429 --> 01:06:04,349
motor it actually puts a laser on your

1638
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:07,660
nail itself and gives you a recoil to it

1639
01:06:04,349 --> 01:06:12,159
laser touches a straight up coil to it

1640
01:06:07,659 --> 01:06:15,629
to get used to have to be skilled but

1641
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:15,629
now there's a new one out there that's

1642
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:25,240
actually I think that can talk about

1643
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:27,670
these things because there are a lot of

1644
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:29,229
variables when it comes to this and you

1645
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:31,809
know he mentioned the puff Co peak it's

1646
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:34,000
all personal preference for me and

1647
01:06:31,809 --> 01:06:35,590
judging a lot of these cups I couldn't

1648
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,320
deal with the variables of the timers I

1649
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:41,350
mean I took the punch because I was able

1650
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:43,240
to put it on a very specific temperature

1651
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:45,699
each and every time yeah yeah

1652
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:48,759
the consistency so that I was able to

1653
01:06:45,699 --> 01:06:51,519
give an even platform to everything that

1654
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:53,620
I was judging was was key to me now I'm

1655
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,090
not saying that it was the best dab you

1656
01:06:53,619 --> 01:06:56,739
know so these guys might actually have

1657
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:59,110
more experience with you know their

1658
01:06:56,739 --> 01:07:02,769
favorite favorite dad but I think it can

1659
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:05,640
be subjective I think for judging I mean

1660
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:08,650
most people are probably just gonna have

1661
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:09,909
access to a torch and a nail you know so

1662
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:12,430
I think that's where most people are

1663
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:14,199
going to experience it you know like a

1664
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:16,839
peaks great I love a peak don't get me

1665
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:18,549
wrong like on the go I'd still rather

1666
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:20,860
have a torch in it you know with me but

1667
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:23,050
a peak is great you know for travels or

1668
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:24,940
things you know and it's just just

1669
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:27,490
convenient like Ben was saying you know

1670
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:29,679
to approach like my father-in-law with

1671
01:07:27,489 --> 01:07:30,750
that you know doesn't really smoke but

1672
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:34,059
we're at a wedding

1673
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:36,519
hey he's interested it looks cool hit it

1674
01:07:34,059 --> 01:07:38,710
boom he hits it so it's like you know

1675
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:40,960
the experience is that I've come across

1676
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:42,880
what the peak is great because of how

1677
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,130
sleek it is it takes away the whole

1678
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,990
stigma of a torch and well what are you

1679
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:50,140
doing smoking crack like it's it's

1680
01:07:46,989 --> 01:07:52,659
definitely a whole better approach but I

1681
01:07:50,139 --> 01:07:54,699
think being at home you know we all

1682
01:07:52,659 --> 01:07:56,799
figure out our ways you know

1683
01:07:54,699 --> 01:07:59,199
we got our glass for our beer a specific

1684
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:01,900
glass we got our specific rig we got our

1685
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:03,489
you know the time that we hit it at and

1686
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,900
and that's also gonna change there's so

1687
01:08:03,489 --> 01:08:06,699
many variables cuz if you're doing a fad

1688
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:08,800
dab obviously you're gonna go in a

1689
01:08:06,699 --> 01:08:11,349
little bit hotter you know so there's a

1690
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:13,390
like area will solve that but it's just

1691
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:15,250
being a connoisseur about it you know if

1692
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:17,590
you love it love it you know I love it

1693
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:25,000
to the fullest and I love it the way you

1694
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:26,920
love it I've seen I've seen your judge

1695
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,250
comes rolling hash into spliffs out of

1696
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:35,079
my what the hell but it's it's to

1697
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:37,000
experience taste like the actual resin

1698
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:38,590
in a bong and there they use that as

1699
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,850
their platform you know they can

1700
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:42,010
actually they can't taste it they just

1701
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:44,050
taste the weed some people need a blunt

1702
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:46,239
they need to back on the outside it's

1703
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:47,920
weird to taste the weed inside and I

1704
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:49,630
don't condone it you know I don't

1705
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,579
condone utilizing the tobacco but for

1706
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:53,529
some reason it's like that standard you

1707
01:08:51,579 --> 01:08:55,989
know for them it might be the taste of

1708
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:58,210
the titanium nail or the torch maybe a

1709
01:08:55,989 --> 01:09:00,460
little bit of the butane from the torch

1710
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:02,199
you know has that standard effect you

1711
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:04,300
know it tastes like that every time you

1712
01:09:02,199 --> 01:09:06,010
know I'm not saying that's the reason by

1713
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:08,320
any means but I think it's just a

1714
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:09,850
subjective answer I'm loving a lot of

1715
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,319
the handheld stuff I feel like one of

1716
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:13,210
the first things that puff coke came out

1717
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:15,819
the really revolutionized things was

1718
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:19,630
their puff coke Plus which was the first

1719
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:21,309
ceramic insert portable pen that you

1720
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:23,409
could load your own you know it wasn't a

1721
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:24,880
cartridge where you had to rely on going

1722
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,199
to your dispensary to purchase that

1723
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,880
cartridge you could make your hash at

1724
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:30,460
your home you can make sure make your

1725
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,869
oil load it into that puff co+ I think

1726
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:35,319
that was a really cool referred over the

1727
01:09:31,869 --> 01:09:37,539
really pretty cool one as well so lots

1728
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:41,139
of devices out there from your hash

1729
01:09:37,539 --> 01:09:43,840
spliff to the peak to the dabber with

1730
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:46,470
the nail and the torch if that answers

1731
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,470
your question sir

1732
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:55,069
hey I was just wondering if you guys had

1733
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:57,829
heard of CBG of course the the mother of

1734
01:09:55,069 --> 01:10:00,920
all cannabinoids that's what every other

1735
01:09:57,829 --> 01:10:03,199
commie Neustadt every every cannabinoid

1736
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:06,470
for the most part that we see THC CBG

1737
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:08,840
starts as I mean CBD or THC starts as

1738
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:10,940
CPG and once the plant matures turns

1739
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:17,119
into the other cannabinoids that we

1740
01:10:10,939 --> 01:10:19,460
value so much so where is that are you

1741
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:21,739
seeing that if you taken a plant down

1742
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:23,480
early and just seen CBG if you cut a

1743
01:10:21,739 --> 01:10:27,649
plant early you'll still see like the

1744
01:10:23,479 --> 01:10:29,239
ratio of THC that you have but the if

1745
01:10:27,649 --> 01:10:32,500
you cut it early you will see extremely

1746
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:36,139
high levels of CBG my experience we had

1747
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:37,489
we cut a harvest early at a facility in

1748
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:38,960
Connecticut

1749
01:10:37,489 --> 01:10:41,590
for various reasons and it had

1750
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,939
predominantly CB gene we got extremely

1751
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:46,460
high yields from our extraction and I

1752
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:49,179
was think we were seeing like 50% CBG in

1753
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:52,090
there but this was a like of just a

1754
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:56,000
almost a vegetative plant at that point

1755
01:10:52,090 --> 01:11:02,810
so will the CBD you know as it oxidizes

1756
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:04,880
will it basically transform or cross

1757
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:07,190
over to whatever it's supposed to like

1758
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:11,270
for instance you know if THC a start

1759
01:11:07,189 --> 01:11:13,279
says CB GA does CB GA at some point

1760
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:16,070
oxidize whether it's in concentrate for

1761
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:18,979
him because you know like THC a will

1762
01:11:16,069 --> 01:11:22,309
degrade to THC and then THC degrades the

1763
01:11:18,979 --> 01:11:24,859
CB n so like this CB g will do the same

1764
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:26,750
word I would assume so but we never had

1765
01:11:24,859 --> 01:11:28,399
it around long enough to do that we've

1766
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:30,560
always been infused it and put it out to

1767
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:32,119
market into topicals I think capsules

1768
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,940
and different and different things like

1769
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:37,519
that from I remember some research that

1770
01:11:34,939 --> 01:11:39,409
we were that we were into at the time CB

1771
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:41,930
g was supposed to be a great cannabinoid

1772
01:11:39,409 --> 01:11:44,389
for cancer patients and stuff like that

1773
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:45,500
so we pushed it out in capsules and

1774
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:47,510
stuff like that so we didn't have the

1775
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:50,930
time to let it sit around or try to

1776
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:54,560
decarboxylate it into the cannabinoids

1777
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:56,220
that follow i personally don't have a

1778
01:11:54,560 --> 01:12:03,539
nice experience with it

1779
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:05,730
why do you ask the question why is it

1780
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:11,149
three times more expensive expect more

1781
01:12:05,729 --> 01:12:13,349
expensive than what it's three times

1782
01:12:11,149 --> 01:12:16,170
falsified already I don't have a lot of

1783
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:18,680
knowledge on it so it's going for ten to

1784
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:20,880
fifteen thousand a liter in Oregon

1785
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:23,220
versus that might be some hype because

1786
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,859
in all honesty I think the reason oh

1787
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:27,840
you're seeing a lot of CBG stuff might

1788
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:29,789
possibly do be due to what Ben saying is

1789
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,650
we're seeing higher concentration of it

1790
01:12:29,789 --> 01:12:33,329
if you pull early Organa had a huge

1791
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:34,920
freezing issue this year a lot of water

1792
01:12:33,329 --> 01:12:36,390
you know and a lot of those farmers

1793
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:38,640
pulled early and they had to do

1794
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:42,180
something with that product I was seeing

1795
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:44,700
a lot of CBG distillate CBG kilos on the

1796
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:47,250
market in my forums actually just in the

1797
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:48,750
last three months and that might be the

1798
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:51,810
reason there might be trying to create a

1799
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:52,560
market for it I mean CBG in my opinion

1800
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:54,780
is easy to get

1801
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:57,600
I mean it's hype like who's creating CBG

1802
01:12:54,779 --> 01:12:59,759
nobody wants CPG they want THC or CBD so

1803
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,740
CBG just because it's like what'swhat's

1804
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:05,460
that acronym let me get some of that you

1805
01:13:01,739 --> 01:13:07,079
know THC V is super expensive too has a

1806
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:09,239
little bit more value in my opinion but

1807
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:11,159
CBG is I mean everywhere cut a plant

1808
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:12,420
early you got CPG it's easy to get but

1809
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:14,340
you know there's a lot there's a lot

1810
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:16,199
that we don't know about all of these

1811
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:18,449
cannabinoids their interactions with

1812
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:21,000
other cannabinoids their interactions

1813
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:22,679
with the terpenes so really you know I

1814
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,960
think that it's all gonna have to do

1815
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:27,000
with more testing more education freeing

1816
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:30,659
up the plan on a federal level to really

1817
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:33,210
really dig into these you know the

1818
01:13:30,659 --> 01:13:35,220
entourage effect really the interaction

1819
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:37,590
of the different cannabinoids with the

1820
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:39,690
different terpenes I personally don't

1821
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:44,510
know enough about CBG and its effects

1822
01:13:39,689 --> 01:13:45,960
alone to give an answer on that one

1823
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:47,329
thank you

1824
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,730
there it has anti-inflammatory

1825
01:13:47,329 --> 01:13:56,359
properties anti-inflammatory properties

1826
01:13:50,729 --> 01:13:59,509
yeah okay okay anyone have a comment

1827
01:13:56,359 --> 01:13:59,509
over there

1828
01:14:05,859 --> 01:14:13,420
what about the like whistler tech kind

1829
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:16,060
of closed systems that they're coming

1830
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:18,340
out for bubble hashing i do i was i was

1831
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:20,980
gonna ask you about this to other kind

1832
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:24,520
of projects along those lines and what

1833
01:14:20,979 --> 01:14:28,959
that might do to just like the

1834
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:34,210
production of hash maker i think that we

1835
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:36,340
cannot be run in a lab that we have

1836
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:42,369
equipment really expensive and be using

1837
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:45,819
plastic bubble machines so since I found

1838
01:14:42,369 --> 01:14:49,420
that that company's creating a big

1839
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:51,849
machine stainless steel with high grade

1840
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:56,050
medical grade everything proper I

1841
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:57,310
thought that that was the Machine I had

1842
01:14:56,050 --> 01:15:00,970
to say that the price is two hundred

1843
01:14:57,310 --> 01:15:03,820
fifty thousand that is important to know

1844
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:06,610
nobody kind of for there's quarter

1845
01:15:03,819 --> 01:15:09,189
million dollars exactly oh and I know

1846
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:10,779
that part Eddie was actually gone and

1847
01:15:09,189 --> 01:15:13,659
visited the facility right yeah you've

1848
01:15:10,779 --> 01:15:15,599
gone and seen the machine yeah what'd

1849
01:15:13,659 --> 01:15:19,359
you guys get to wash there how was the

1850
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:21,520
we do it in a random facility that they

1851
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:24,729
just bought the machine because the

1852
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,770
wizard company if they don't have a way

1853
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:29,500
to show you how the machine works if

1854
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:31,989
they don't buy width so they don't buy

1855
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:33,850
width they do machine so every time that

1856
01:15:31,988 --> 01:15:37,059
they sell one machine they use that

1857
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:40,360
client to show to other clients how the

1858
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:42,430
machine works on that facility the

1859
01:15:40,359 --> 01:15:45,519
people working on the lab they was just

1860
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:46,840
people from lab not from hashas world

1861
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,090
you know so they don't know they don't

1862
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:53,500
know nothing about how they was just

1863
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:56,670
running fresh frozen plants but I don't

1864
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:59,199
know why the quality became really low

1865
01:15:56,670 --> 01:16:03,310
so I'm not really sure if that machine

1866
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:05,349
is it's been created to do formal hash

1867
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:10,510
it's been created to do massive

1868
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:14,110
production probably with have always

1869
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:17,710
always weighed but not to do like formal

1870
01:16:14,109 --> 01:16:18,699
it's not for that so I love the question

1871
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:20,880
though and it's something that a lot of

1872
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:25,119
us have been working on for a long time

1873
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:28,119
there are a few units out there that are

1874
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:32,380
100% stainless steel and there's been

1875
01:16:28,119 --> 01:16:35,140
other companies discussing it the I I do

1876
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:37,300
see a lot of value in the fully closed

1877
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:39,940
loop version you know having stainless

1878
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:41,829
steel as your agitation but I still to

1879
01:16:39,939 --> 01:16:44,109
this day have not seen anybody bring it

1880
01:16:41,829 --> 01:16:46,659
to fruition and have the agitation

1881
01:16:44,109 --> 01:16:49,149
coupled with the separation in one unit

1882
01:16:46,659 --> 01:16:52,119
you know bubble bags ice water

1883
01:16:49,149 --> 01:16:55,799
extraction bags essential bags ice

1884
01:16:52,119 --> 01:16:59,140
extract bags bolt bags you name it the

1885
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,550
pollinator bags you know these bags have

1886
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:02,289
been around for a long time and it's

1887
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:04,420
what we use coupled with whatever

1888
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:07,630
agitation we're using whether we use in

1889
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:09,640
hand agitation with wooden doors or

1890
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:11,739
paddles whether we're utilizing a

1891
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:13,360
washing machine I said it was mentioning

1892
01:17:11,739 --> 01:17:15,550
these plastic washing machines that have

1893
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:17,409
been used in our little space and

1894
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:19,360
industry for the last 10 years or

1895
01:17:17,409 --> 01:17:23,559
whether using one of the brand new

1896
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:27,549
Brutus stainless steel barrels from pure

1897
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:31,240
penetration there is a huge need right

1898
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:33,340
now to couple that agitation whatever it

1899
01:17:31,239 --> 01:17:36,789
may be whether it's magnetic or

1900
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:38,860
electronic or mechanical agitation with

1901
01:17:36,789 --> 01:17:41,380
separation because in reality when we

1902
01:17:38,859 --> 01:17:43,779
first went to states like Nevada and

1903
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:45,310
talk to them about water extraction bags

1904
01:17:43,779 --> 01:17:47,139
they were not for it the health

1905
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:50,230
department didn't like it there were a

1906
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:53,950
lot of nose that came with reusing nylon

1907
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:56,199
bags over and over again so as we move

1908
01:17:53,949 --> 01:17:58,359
forward there is a huge need for some

1909
01:17:56,199 --> 01:18:00,069
type of closed-loop unit I for one have

1910
01:17:58,359 --> 01:18:02,380
been working on a unit I've got five

1911
01:18:00,069 --> 01:18:03,909
seven prototypes at this point still

1912
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:05,949
haven't found the exact thing that I'm

1913
01:18:03,909 --> 01:18:08,170
looking for I'm flying up next week to a

1914
01:18:05,949 --> 01:18:11,139
place that we're working on but I hope

1915
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:12,970
to be another final one but I think a

1916
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:14,500
lot of us are working on it Ben looks

1917
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:16,119
like he's itching to talk about his

1918
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:18,310
newest product coming out of rosin tech

1919
01:18:16,119 --> 01:18:19,840
products but you know there's a lot of

1920
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:21,100
people working on this and to be honest

1921
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,510
whoever comes out with it first I'm

1922
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:27,139
gonna support me to like say for sure

1923
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:28,520
I'm excited for it

1924
01:18:27,139 --> 01:18:32,029
things that I think all of us are like

1925
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:33,679
drooling to get you know agitation is

1926
01:18:32,029 --> 01:18:35,630
one thing collection is total something

1927
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:36,800
totally different I think with Whistler

1928
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:38,539
tech and a lot of the other machines

1929
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,940
I've seen or trying to utilize the

1930
01:18:38,539 --> 01:18:43,219
stainless steel mesh is utilizing a

1931
01:18:40,939 --> 01:18:45,289
totally straight flat stainless steel

1932
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:48,469
and to collect the trichomes off that

1933
01:18:45,289 --> 01:18:50,359
it's not as easy as like a bag a bag is

1934
01:18:48,469 --> 01:18:52,010
easy to to put a spoon in there and

1935
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:54,109
scoop it out nice and generally and not

1936
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:56,090
disturb those heads where if you try to

1937
01:18:54,109 --> 01:18:58,729
collect it from a straight up stainless

1938
01:18:56,090 --> 01:19:01,159
steel flat screen you're just pushing

1939
01:18:58,729 --> 01:19:03,888
smashing heads these things that we've

1940
01:19:01,158 --> 01:19:04,879
done delicate harvest with to put all

1941
01:19:03,889 --> 01:19:06,770
this energy to grow and they're just

1942
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:11,239
smashing them against the stainless

1943
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:12,980
steel screen is quite an issue so I mean

1944
01:19:11,238 --> 01:19:15,169
not that we you know have anything to

1945
01:19:12,979 --> 01:19:16,759
announce but you know it's I'm excited

1946
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:19,039
to see you know and I don't know where

1947
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:21,530
you have been playing with a lot of

1948
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:23,658
people trying for these columns that the

1949
01:19:21,529 --> 01:19:25,729
shaker columns you know they're used to

1950
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:28,059
separate paint or used to separate

1951
01:19:25,729 --> 01:19:30,888
different settlement types and sizes

1952
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:33,139
these shaker columns for years for dry

1953
01:19:30,889 --> 01:19:35,449
sift but Eddie you mentioned that you

1954
01:19:33,139 --> 01:19:38,210
know even with those units we've seen a

1955
01:19:35,448 --> 01:19:40,250
lot more raw or crude end products that

1956
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:42,230
then have to be cleaned further so there

1957
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:43,908
is value to getting a lot of a crude

1958
01:19:42,229 --> 01:19:46,279
product and then cleaning further down

1959
01:19:43,908 --> 01:19:48,229
the line and I think we're all going

1960
01:19:46,279 --> 01:19:50,630
towards that same goal of finding a

1961
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:52,488
closed loop unit that doesn't just

1962
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:54,109
produce crude but produce the craft that

1963
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:55,879
we're looking for I think there's always

1964
01:19:54,109 --> 01:19:58,250
gonna be there's always gonna be a

1965
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:00,560
market for handmade ash and I really

1966
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:02,448
don't think that handmade hashes is

1967
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,039
going anywhere I think that even with

1968
01:20:02,448 --> 01:20:05,779
these developments of larger machines

1969
01:20:04,039 --> 01:20:08,149
whether it be even the marketing of

1970
01:20:05,779 --> 01:20:09,948
handmade hash it's always gonna be

1971
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:12,109
slightly higher quality I think how can

1972
01:20:09,948 --> 01:20:14,118
you get I made handmade hash that

1973
01:20:12,109 --> 01:20:16,309
smelled like mildew and was black and

1974
01:20:14,118 --> 01:20:19,460
pliable that about commander casinos so

1975
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:21,230
you know there is value to changing up

1976
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:23,960
what we've known from the past and you

1977
01:20:21,229 --> 01:20:26,779
know being open to what's coming in the

1978
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:28,670
future for sure I think I think the

1979
01:20:26,779 --> 01:20:32,300
Whistler tech I mean the closed-loop

1980
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:34,550
systems are gonna be great for rosin

1981
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:36,409
extraction for sure I mean especially if

1982
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:38,659
we're going for like full-spectrum and

1983
01:20:36,408 --> 01:20:39,710
you know I think it's gonna take a lot

1984
01:20:38,658 --> 01:20:42,349
of us getting in there

1985
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:44,239
really testing these machines and and

1986
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:47,570
tweaking them and putting our little

1987
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:49,099
techniques and really understanding what

1988
01:20:47,569 --> 01:20:50,689
it's doing and what we can do to change

1989
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:52,789
it and adjust it you know like any

1990
01:20:50,689 --> 01:20:56,509
machines just a base you know but then

1991
01:20:52,789 --> 01:20:58,430
you start putting the people who don't

1992
01:20:56,510 --> 01:21:01,610
know what to tweak and what to add you

1993
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:04,310
know add this do this my feeling when I

1994
01:21:01,609 --> 01:21:06,949
was there it was that that they are just

1995
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:09,739
people that they they do machines they

1996
01:21:06,949 --> 01:21:11,659
don't do hash so there's few points that

1997
01:21:09,738 --> 01:21:13,519
they do they don't understand how they

1998
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:16,130
have to do it because they don't do hash

1999
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:18,680
so they need people like us going there

2000
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:20,779
and telling them a that machine is good

2001
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:23,210
but you have to change these and that or

2002
01:21:20,779 --> 01:21:26,710
I need these or that on your machine so

2003
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:29,750
we have to like do it together there's

2004
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:31,789
there's a lot of chemistry going into it

2005
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:33,469
whereas chemistry and hash making are

2006
01:21:31,789 --> 01:21:34,819
two different things in my opinion were

2007
01:21:33,469 --> 01:21:36,859
separating heads were mechanically

2008
01:21:34,819 --> 01:21:38,840
separating oil and a lot of people

2009
01:21:36,859 --> 01:21:40,159
developing these products are from a

2010
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:42,199
chemistry background was a science

2011
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:44,420
background that is extremely valuable

2012
01:21:42,199 --> 01:21:46,639
but doesn't always translate it's really

2013
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:49,279
hard to say that there's a science to

2014
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:52,190
extraction because in reality you make a

2015
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:55,250
rosin press for example where you can

2016
01:21:52,189 --> 01:21:56,539
create you know a certain pressure for a

2017
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:58,550
certain amount of time at a certain

2018
01:21:56,539 --> 01:22:01,039
temperature and right and you call it

2019
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:02,449
Sour Diesel so right you you think that

2020
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:04,219
you're coming into your lab and you're

2021
01:22:02,449 --> 01:22:05,630
like okay perfect I got a bunch of Sour

2022
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:07,100
Diesel I'm gonna press the button that

2023
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:09,079
says Sour Diesel and everything's gonna

2024
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:11,360
be good because it's all programmed for

2025
01:22:09,079 --> 01:22:14,269
the Sour Diesel temperature and pressure

2026
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:16,569
and everything else but not all Sour

2027
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:18,739
Diesel is the same you know and not all

2028
01:22:16,569 --> 01:22:20,659
rounds of Sour Diesel the same maybe

2029
01:22:18,738 --> 01:22:24,379
it's the same phenotype from the same

2030
01:22:20,659 --> 01:22:26,059
grow but this round it was you know that

2031
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:27,800
he had too much magnesium or too much

2032
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:29,600
fossil load or something he added to

2033
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,550
that round and the pressure and the

2034
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,710
temperature changes up so it's really

2035
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:35,539
really hard to just say that you know

2036
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:37,149
you're gonna press one button and you're

2037
01:22:35,539 --> 01:22:40,880
gonna be good to go

2038
01:22:37,149 --> 01:22:43,039
cannabis is a different plant and it has

2039
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,319
a lot of variables associated with it

2040
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:47,479
I think I think it really matters I

2041
01:22:45,319 --> 01:22:49,279
think we can all agree that us up here I

2042
01:22:47,479 --> 01:22:52,809
have a true passion for it I think that

2043
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:55,029
part of what makes like a hash maker

2044
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:57,400
or somebody is is to be able to define

2045
01:22:55,029 --> 01:23:01,559
what is a good product what is the real

2046
01:22:57,399 --> 01:23:03,879
Sour Diesel cut what is you know a good

2047
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,140
development of that cut you know what I

2048
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:07,020
mean there's different hues different

2049
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:09,310
levels to the terpenes that you can hit

2050
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:10,800
and a little bit comes with the with

2051
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:13,180
experience and knowing what a good

2052
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:17,140
cannabis product is or hash or a good

2053
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:20,170
strain a good profile definitely

2054
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:22,030
definitely I agree for sure I've been

2055
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:24,489
doing highs for a long time and I've

2056
01:23:22,029 --> 01:23:27,309
been losing money a lot bro just trying

2057
01:23:24,489 --> 01:23:29,679
to find the best product so if you have

2058
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:32,500
passion on doing high as you are not

2059
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:35,500
doing hydro wrong we're all consumers

2060
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:37,510
first right like the passion is what

2061
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:40,779
keeps us dedicated and pushing forward

2062
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:44,010
in innovation and it's what so why we've

2063
01:23:40,779 --> 01:23:47,759
evolved so quickly as Saul says you know

2064
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:51,039
all of us on stage want to smoke I

2065
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:53,289
actually I actually loved hearing Nick

2066
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:55,750
you and Phil talk about the origins of

2067
01:23:53,289 --> 01:23:57,369
hash you know I still I still nerd out

2068
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:59,140
on that on that stuff where you don't

2069
01:23:57,369 --> 01:24:01,750
get to you don't forget to hear to guys

2070
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:05,050
like Phillip Nick you know talk about

2071
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:07,539
you know putting it to an email you know

2072
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:08,890
and doing a five times that's you know

2073
01:24:07,539 --> 01:24:11,319
that's cool stuff and I think that you

2074
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:13,510
know a lot of us really appreciate and

2075
01:24:11,319 --> 01:24:15,699
nerd out on those types of stories the

2076
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:19,119
old genetic stories and the beef in the

2077
01:24:15,699 --> 01:24:21,220
cannabis industry is like it's the juice

2078
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:22,840
this is real oral tradition this is what

2079
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:24,190
happened now a lot of this is written

2080
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,930
down but we're gonna tell it to you

2081
01:24:24,189 --> 01:24:28,349
straight here today give thanks for

2082
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:28,350
coming out

2083
01:24:29,149 --> 01:24:35,009
[Applause]
