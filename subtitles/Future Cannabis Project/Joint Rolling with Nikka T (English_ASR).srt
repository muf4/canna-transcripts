5
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,989
was grown by some good friends of mine

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:38,100
my hands here and so you are about to

7

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:46,380
actually about to release a pre-roll

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:48,300
collaboration right now yeah we're about

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:52,380

11
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:55,468
the Moana brand essential extracts alien

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:58,770
labs and Kali kosher alien labs is

times kosher Kush so we're using dried

15
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,680
cured baklava flour and then we're using

16
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:13,500
Cali kosher x' fresh frozen friddle's

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,659
string friddle's and this is whole plant

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,909
fresh frozen friddle's is forbidden

19
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:23,640
fruit I'm skittles has this amazing

20
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:26,490
candy citrus flavor and we hand selected

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,510
the material we are hand-washing that

22
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:33,599
fresh frozen and hand rolling these

23
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,130
joints and really proud of the

24
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:40,489
collaboration the joint tastes amazing

25
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:41,640
it's one gram of flour 23 full melt hash

26
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:44,129
yeah

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,500
really properly hand rolled by myself

28
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,500
just like this but with gloves on and

29
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:57,029
yeah that should be releasing this June

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,400
and so just quickly so you have a little

31
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,280
European style going on here to talk

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,850
about so first of all you're using I'm

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,530
using a doubled up crutch I like the

34
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:10,199
left east crutch because I like a long

35
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,348
crutch here helps cool down the smoke

36
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,688
helps keep the weed out of my mouth and

37
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:17,878
just helps support a longer spliff as

38
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:20,609
well so i like that longer crush

39
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:26,039
basically doubled up rode up

40
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:29,580
I we call it a crutch or a filter - this

41
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:32,489
is the part I don't condone but since I

42
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:36,200
was a youth I grew up with European

43
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:38,280
foreign exchange doing European friends

44
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:41,219
traveled all over the world and this

45
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,050
unfortunately has stuck with me the

46
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:50,969
blending of the tobacco or the gravel

47
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:54,270
into this spliff here this is a smoking

48
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:57,750
brown unbleached roll so build your own

49
00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:00,300
size basically smoking brown you know

50
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,860
there's a few unbleached papers out

51
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,990
there on the market right now and I just

52
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,510
really prefer everything that smoking

53
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,459
has done over the years I started with

54
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:10,439
smoking blacks and move actually I think

55
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,479
smoking EKOS which was the hemp one with

56
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,579
the dehydrated honey glue moved on to

57
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,199
smoking blacks and then smoking masters

58
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,719
which is the silver pack which is a real

59
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:25,049
thin paper and now I've kind of just

60
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:28,620
been stuck on these smoking Browns and I

61
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:33,600
just like how they burn they taste a

62
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:36,620
little bit less almost woody or

63
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,879
cellulose II than the raw papers to me

64
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,310
so it's important that I get a real

65
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,959
tight against the crutch there to me

66
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,120
it's about a folding it's not really a

67
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,680
rolling technique so we fold that paper

68
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:54,989
right there we get the conical shape

69
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:56,099
here tuck and a fold the lick part won't

70
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:59,750
be happening in our pre-roll

71
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:11,519
collaboration either we're using a

72
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:13,590
paintbrush sponges not an auth box cuz I

73
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,510
really want the homogenate homogeneous

74
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,639
Asian of the hash so we're actually

75
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:19,889
mixing the hash and the flours in a cold

76
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,779
room and I'm rolling this up in a cold

77
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,060
room with the hash in it so we have full

78
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,250
homogenization the hash remains a powder

79
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,019
that way we can completely homogenize it

80
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,459
with the flowers

81
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:32,370
and then once it reaches room

82
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:35,519
temperature kind of melts out yeah so

83
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:43,319
there's the nicotine style spliff right

84
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:46,019
there this is a little bit longer a

85
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,939
little bit larger than the size but it

86
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,959
is a little bit large and larger than a

87
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,240
king size paper

88
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,000
oh it's whatever pretty rule is so talk

89
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:58,410
about it I mean you just rolled your own

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,478
joined with amazing flour obviously with

91
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,840
a pre roll it gets a little stale so can

92
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,918
you talk about how you reconcile it like

93
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,109
you're coming out with a brand of

94
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:08,459
pre-rolls I don't think yeah and first

95
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,259
of all you know we're really trying to

96
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,519
stick away from the term pre-roll

97
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,288
because I think a lot of the pre rolls

98
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:17,399
out there on the market are that knock

99
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:20,129
box dried stale trim things of that

100
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,459
nature so we're using hold buds cured

101
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:25,259
buds from alien labs we're mixing that

102
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,658
in the cold room like I said with our

103
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,639
hash packing it into the joints like

104
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:31,500
this then we're actually putting these

105
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,319
into a sauna tube which is a hemp

106
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,180
plastic tube we're wrapping that with a

107
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,370
heat shield shrink wrap and then that

108
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,978
goes into the box so I think the heat

109
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:44,478
sealed shrink wrap is how I'm trying to

110
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:48,508
avoid a lot of that stale that stale

111
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:50,459
flower situation mixing the hash in

112
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,770
there just I don't know it's it's

113
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:54,839
keeping the consistency we're seeing a

114
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,968
nice shelf stability on it for sure and

115
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:01,019
you're environmentally conscious with

116
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:03,899
the son of plastic yeah there's so much

117
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:07,019
waste out there and we really you know

118
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:09,750
we really tried to do everything we

119
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:12,000
could to avoid the waste situation with

120
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,459
a pre-roll though I do want the shrink

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,899
wrap I do want as much of the you know

122
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:21,239
keeping that flavor in there as possible

123
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:23,339
but yeah you know with the compliance

124
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,990
and all the regulation aspects of our

125
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:28,168
industry there is a lot of waste that

126
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,329
you just have to do and it's unfortunate

127
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:30,819
but we're trying to go every route we

128
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:35,519
can

129
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:35,519
hemp to recycle

130
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:47,980
