00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:08,779
[Music]

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:12,349
it's funny because a lot of people

3
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:14,660
really discount Auto flowers they think

4
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:16,730
that other low yielding and they're not

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,070
good for the breeding scene and and I

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,560
got to tell you that Auto flowers are

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,760
great for a very particular kind of

8
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:24,979
grower

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,720
they're fantastic for patients they're

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,539
fantastic for people with mobility

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,489
issues they're wonderful for folks who

12
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:33,170
live where we live where you know we

13
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,729
start to get the rains they're the last

14
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,948
week of September the first week of

15
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:39,500
October and our eight-week blooming

16
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:41,899
flowers are just getting finished and

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,000
then the mold rolls in whereas with an

18
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:47,869
auto flower you can pop a seed on June 1

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,048
and harvest on September 1 and you're

20
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:52,908
well ahead of the you know well ahead of

21
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:56,018
the weather you might need to you know

22
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:58,250
you might need to plant twice as many

23
00:00:56,018 --> 00:01:00,378
but the idea that you can get done

24
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,768
without your plants molding is a huge

25
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:03,649
win

26
00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:05,810
so most people may understand that autos

27
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:08,269
finish faster but that doesn't seem to

28
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,070
be that doesn't mean the best

29
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:12,439
application for autos are readily

30
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:14,750
apparent to everyone so I would like to

31
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:18,230
hear you both starting with you Jeff how

32
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,900
will autos influence cannabis growing in

33
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:23,750
horticulture going forward well let me

34
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,880
give two different answers the book as

35
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,129
you indicated is really an introductory

36
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:29,719
book I like to say it's a book for your

37
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,759
sister and your brother it's a book for

38
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:33,469
your your Uncle Bob and Aunt Sally it's

39
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,350
not a book for our professional grower

40
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:38,120
I'm convinced that Auto flower cannabis

41
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:41,119
is going to change the general

42
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,719
populations attitude about cannabis

43
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,570
because it's the next tomato plant once

44
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,760
in a lifetime I'm 70 years old it's only

45
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:51,819
happened to me once once in a lifetime a

46
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,560
new plant is introduced to the general

47
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:56,599
horticultural gardening public the last

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,740
time it happened it was the snap pea

49
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:02,629
they took over the pea world and every

50
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:04,369
gardener grows snap peas a couple of

51
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:06,289
times during their career and probably

52
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,579
every year that's what's gonna happen I

53
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,250
think to these Auto flowers because

54
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:12,408
they're so easy to grow their quality

55
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,050
has risen so high as a result of the

56
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:17,329
genetics and so that's the first answer

57
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,990
the second answer is this is a plant

58
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,000
which you can grow on a deck

59
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,860
which you can grow outside in a garden

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,319
you can grow it in a perennial bed you

61
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,660
can grow it in a pot in the ground and

62
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,419
so it's something that is accessible to

63
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,490
all growers not just people who have big

64
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:34,769
farms or a big greenhouse and because

65
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,180
they don't have a photo period it means

66
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,150
that people who live in northern

67
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,310
climates like Alaska where on September

68
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,860
21st your plant finally gets the

69
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,949
darkness that it needs to set flower you

70
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,960
also get a frost that night and then

71
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:51,419
finally for those who do professionally

72
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,480
grow here is a plant which you can use

73
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:57,089
to enter space between your plants as

74
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,009
they veg the same thing your plant says

75
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,659
they flower you just put them in they

76
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:02,370
don't care what the light is you can

77
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,349
give them 20 24 hours of light they're

78
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,960
gonna flower based on their genetics and

79
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:10,439
so you can use your spare space this is

80
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,620
a dream for the entire horticultural

81
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,319
world fantastic so so Seth I know you're

82
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,819
coming from a little different direction

83
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,769
Jeff and I share that we were but very

84
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,150
interested in home growers and patient

85
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,700
growers the other thing I wanted to hit

86
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,800
on was it was how appropriate these are

87
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,869
for patients and for people with lower

88
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,510
mobility because like Jeff mentioned

89
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,980
these are very compact plants right

90
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,859
these pretty much top out at around

91
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,389
three three and a half feet and and

92
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,860
because of that you don't have to do the

93
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,859
reaching and they're not hard to break

94
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,170
down and and you know the patient can

95
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,940
stand up and look all around them for

96
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,649
mold instead of you know trying to work

97
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,270
with some of these nine footers where

98
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,069
they're just impossible to work with

99
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,140
they're beautiful and I love them and I

100
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,159
want to talk them right but but they're

101
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,769
really they're you know they're all

102
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,449
caged and difficult to work with so this

103
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,400
is something that that folks who are

104
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:01,530
living in an apartment who are growing

105
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,240
in a tent can grow for these together

106
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,580
with no sweat you don't even need to

107
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,640
scrub them and and then if you're a

108
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,190
patient they're so easily it's easy to

109
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,139
use and always going to flower in a

110
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:15,629
particular timeframe you'd be ready to

111
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,738
go that it really opens up the door but

112
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:18,719
let's not leave the impression that

113
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,159
these are little teeny baby flowers

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,780
because they're little teeny plants you

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,910
know I mean there there's there's a

116
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:28,739
there are some I've seen colors that are

117
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:30,900
80 grams Wow unbelievable and they'll

118
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,460
have you know 10 of these colas on a

119
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:35,849
plant so so these

120
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:39,870
not the the lowrider that you remember

121
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:42,900
these are a totally new plant ready for

122
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,879
primetime in the book I'm stressed that

123
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:47,609
it's that from the perspective of an

124
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,189
amateur growing these things they they

125
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,259
don't really like to be repotted all the

126
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:54,600
time I mean you so I always tell people

127
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,550
to grow them in the original container I

128
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,960
started out with three three gallon

129
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,280
containers because you know I thought

130
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,839
the plants were cute and everything else

131
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,639
and there's something they call it now

132
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,979
super Auto flowers they're really the

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,050
same thing but different soil structure

134
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,850
and different soil amounts and so now

135
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,379
I'm telling people I five gallons is

136
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,810
good that you know you'll pick what is

137
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:15,180
Hardware bucket but seven gallons is

138
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,680
even better and you put the seed right

139
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,490
in it I mean I don't even start them in

140
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,490
a because I think if they if they are

141
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,990
stressed they will flower and the worst

142
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:29,790
thing you can have is something that

143
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:32,189
flowers when it's they're not cheap

144
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,650
seeds although you can grow your own

145
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:35,850
seeds and they become cheap yeah it's

146
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:38,519
disappointing when they're five inches

147
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,320
tall yeah and I actually I actually did

148
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,449
that for my first time and I have I can

149
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,089
admit to making that mistake my first

150
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:47,159
tray last year I still like my idea I

151
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:49,560
put them in root Riot plugs which I like

152
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,960
because um when i find when i propagate

153
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,970
right into soil it's a lot more

154
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:57,089
difficult to keep the soil or keep the

155
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,220
seed in a moist environment right the

156
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:01,379
the top of the soil dries out really

157
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,720
fast whereas those root riots while they

158
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,810
are soil and so i'll put the seed in

159
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,370
there let it pop and as soon as i've got

160
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,860
like you know you know firmly

161
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,750
established coddled and leaves then i go

162
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,420
ahead and i put it in before the the

163
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,800
roots are coming out the bottom and they

164
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,689
do make some cute little plants i mean

165
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,139
you I saw a little plant growing in a

166
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:24,329
thimble with with it with a you know it

167
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:28,289
had a beautiful little head about that

168
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:30,300
big was just yeah kind of thing you put

169
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:33,000
on Instagram and go look at this anybody

170
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,430
goes Wow and so I had a tray of these

171
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,430
right I had a tray of these and and I

172
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,590
let them sit too long in the tray before

173
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,660
I because you're right you said you know

174
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:44,419
that same week you know right so so I

175
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,920
let them sit to there and so I

176
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:50,569
tray of very expensive beautiful 8-inch

177
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,290
Auto flowers and each one had this

178
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:57,379
gorgeous big noggin top and and you know

179
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:01,340
the the yield per weight was incredible

180
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:03,469
the yield per $15 seed was not right so

181
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:06,199
so I'm growing my own and still paying

182
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,870
$15 a gram which is like not not a win

183
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,060
but they made awesome gifts to people

184
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,379
because you give somebody a small plant

185
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,660
with this fully mature bud and you're

186
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,980
like here you go snip it off like let it

187
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,630
dry for a couple days and smoke it and

188
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,370
they're like really well and actually

189
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:21,860
you know I know we're getting getting

190
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,230
out of order here but but but keeping in

191
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,270
my idea that this is the next tomato I'm

192
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,670
convinced that that in in the next

193
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:32,269
future few years you're gonna be able to

194
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:34,430
walk into you know Whole Foods or

195
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:36,019
wherever at Christmas time and they're

196
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,939
gonna have a little shelf and it's gonna

197
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:39,199
have you know 30 little Auto flower

198
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:40,969
plants sitting there that look like a

199
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,459
little Christmas trees they're decorated

200
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,960
you know and then at Easter Easter time

201
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:46,219
you know you're gonna have a play you

202
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,409
know plants with a little that little

203
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:53,540
green plastic crap you know this is

204
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:56,450
these plants are unbelievable they are

205
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:00,430
so much fun to grow I just cannot you

206
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:00,430
can I'm peeing in my pants I love this

207
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,210
so so I wanna I want to bring the

208
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,560
conversation back to medical which

209
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,180
obviously I keep bringing this

210
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,040
conversation back to you because those

211
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,780
are the people I work with a lot and so

212
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,720
and we're gonna keep going with you Jeff

213
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:16,399
and then we'll jump back to Seth so so

214
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,390
in terms of medical Jeff I'd like you to

215
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:22,069
speak a bit to the ease of growing and

216
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,379
and I've heard you talk about how you

217
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:25,790
can actually do too much right so I

218
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,009
wanna I would like to hear that and then

219
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,650
and then and then Seth would you pick up

220
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:33,169
since you are analytically breeding

221
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:36,350
these to help with particular ailments

222
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:38,419
I'd like to hear from you how the the

223
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,759
breeding of Auto flowers are can be so

224
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,319
targeted because they're so they're so

225
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:44,419
quick to cycle so but Jeff let's start

226
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:50,930
with you well you know these are these

227
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:52,849
are unbelievable plants and and they

228
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:55,639
just just the you know the only thing I

229
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,110
could compare it to as a marigold you

230
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,289
know I read a garden column in the in

231
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,119
the newspaper up in Anchorage

232
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:01,469
and and you know marigolds are the one

233
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:02,609
plan I say you know you got a have you

234
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,439
got a plan something or you're not a

235
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,699
real gardener so you plan a marigold you

236
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:07,498
can have you a kid do it with you

237
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:08,698
because it's the only seat you stick the

238
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:10,409
seat in the ground it's like a sunflower

239
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:11,519
seed there's certain see you just put

240
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:12,928
them in the ground you walk away you

241
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,159
don't do anything and they grow well

242
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,720
they grow the way they're supposed to

243
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,818
grow and that's what happens with these

244
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,668
plants if you put too much fertilizer in

245
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:22,048
the soil if you put any for I don't put

246
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:24,600
any fertilizer the first time you grow

247
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:26,338
it because you may not need it ever you

248
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,339
know you got to watch these plants very

249
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:31,439
carefully they grow so quickly that you

250
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,419
know that when the whitefly or whatever

251
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:35,248
decides to hit it all of a sudden it's

252
00:09:33,418 --> 00:09:37,078
going through the stage where the where

253
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:38,579
the you know the right kind of juices

254
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:39,899
it's wait a minute

255
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,638
what happened to my plant it's not the

256
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:45,028
same plant anymore and the insect moves

257
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,948
on I mean these things don't need a lot

258
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:48,720
of care now you got to keep an eye out

259
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:52,099
for mildew and the kinds of things that

260
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,079
you normally do but they grow so quickly

261
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,759
that that that if you if you push them

262
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:59,219
too much they're not gonna grow well the

263
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,749
only thing I do to mine to start when I

264
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,639
buy a seed from somebody I don't know

265
00:10:00,749 --> 00:10:04,889
what you know well there's gonna be any

266
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,778
good I put the mycorrhizal fungi on it

267
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:09,359
and that is all I do

268
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:11,458
and generally I've never had to

269
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,059
fertilize any of my plants and they grow

270
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,828
so fast

271
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:15,899
for those of you who grow indoor

272
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:17,969
especially in tens you don't really have

273
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,918
enough time to screw them up and that's

274
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,678
fantastic right you know I had never

275
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:24,600
heard your example Jeff about the the

276
00:10:22,678 --> 00:10:26,879
plant growing through the stage of life

277
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,528
that appealed to any particular pest but

278
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,409
that makes sense the first round I did

279
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:33,509
I've got no mold issues no pest issues

280
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:35,788
and and we're you know where I live on

281
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:37,739
Vashon Island we don't have that much

282
00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:39,688
pest but we always get mold right and

283
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:41,158
and it's just that their life cycle is

284
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:43,528
so short a lot of that stuff doesn't

285
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:46,588
have a time to take over and they've

286
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:47,908
been bred to get rid of the mold so I

287
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:50,339
know the good the people that grow it

288
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:51,749
new breed seeds that's what they were

289
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:57,809
looking for mo let's get rid of that

290
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:59,220
mold and they did in terms of being able

291
00:10:57,808 --> 00:11:00,808
to use these plants for different

292
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,408
medical conditions I always defer to dr.

293
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:05,578
Ethan Rousseau who is somewhere out here

294
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:07,408
so I'm not going to speak to exactly

295
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,448
what type of compounds are going to help

296
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:10,948
for particular ailments all we know is

297
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:12,219
that all of these different compounds

298
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:13,509
are very useful

299
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,399
trying to figure out exactly how to

300
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:17,439
triangulate and make use of those

301
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,329
compounds and get them into plants in a

302
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,080
way that's useful for patients and for

303
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:25,270
people across the world is is really our

304
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,190
goal see unless you live in Alaska where

305
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:29,500
you let have six plants three of which

306
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,660
are allowed to be in flower you know so

307
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,909
I always tell people don't treat this

308
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:36,309
like broccoli you know where you plant

309
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:38,439
it all at once you stagger it and I

310
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:40,599
don't mean you wait for the crop them to

311
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,160
harvest you know every two weeks or

312
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,409
every week you put it in a couple of

313
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,059
more seeds and then when the regulator

314
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:46,899
comes to your house you go now I got

315
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,939
three in flower

316
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:53,470
you know forget the fact that I got 50

317
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:55,930
pounds of drying weed over here but but

318
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,470
but they really are everything you say

319
00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:01,359
again sort of emphasizes the idea that

320
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,629
home gardener would you know people grow

321
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,190
heirloom tomatoes you know married Mary

322
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:08,230
and next-door neighbor she's famous

323
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,540
because she's got the Oregon summer

324
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,340
spring and and George next door is

325
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:13,870
famous because his are plum tomatoes

326
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,430
gonna make the best sauce you know and

327
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,509
they give them away and and that's the

328
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:18,399
same thing that's gonna happen with

329
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:20,169
these auto flours mine look at the

330
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,970
colors on this one look at the landscape

331
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:23,439
capabilities on this one you know

332
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,870
they're not they're gonna be landscape

333
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,190
plants they're gonna be a plant that

334
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,470
everybody access we've got to get rid of

335
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,850
that stigma but it's happening and this

336
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,379
is the plant that's gonna carry us over

337
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,389
the line I'm convinced and help the big

338
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:36,309
plants as well so I really like what you

339
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:39,069
said too about neighbors sharing right

340
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:41,619
because if we all have got plant limits

341
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,690
we're limited by our variety and you

342
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,759
know it's just like tomatoes right you

343
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,290
know if you grow tomatoes at home you're

344
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,330
still gonna end up buying Tomatoes at

345
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:51,699
the store it's not like commercial

346
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,530
tomato growers are all hosed because

347
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,000
we're all growing at home tomatoes you

348
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:58,269
buy the ones at the store so you get the

349
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,500
seeds so you can grow yourself okay but

350
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:02,019
but this is another great idea because

351
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,850
neighbors can you know grow different

352
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:05,799
varieties and trade and it creates

353
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,149
increased community and everybody gets

354
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,979
to try more wheat right yeah and so

355
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:11,079
that's the win as well so last year in

356
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,200
the a at the Alaska State Fair they

357
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,000
actually in Kenai they had a

358
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,650
you nervous entry thing and I'm

359
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,059
convinced every every State Fair in the

360
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:19,919
country is gonna have an auto flower

361
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:22,199
cannabis contest you know I mean it's

362
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,779
just this is the best thing that ever

363
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,970
happened to our industry because it's

364
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,559
gonna get mom-and-pop and Uncle Bob and

365
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,710
he and Sally who normally would be

366
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,779
against it into it that's what we really

367
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,750
need so we can get the taxes out of them

368
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:48,220
amen

369
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:48,220
