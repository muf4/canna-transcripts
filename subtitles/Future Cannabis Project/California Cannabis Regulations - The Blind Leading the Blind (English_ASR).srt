1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,419
the state was wonderful enough to give

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:09,750
me my permit on July 11 yeah it was like

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:13,379
wow thanks I had it I had my application

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:19,109
in in November I gave up I was this like

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:21,300
okay yeah so you know this this year or

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,609
last year was our first year out there

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,949
we had started the whole process in

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,720
November of the year before we got

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,679
dragged through the mud and hemmed and

10
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:35,789
hawed you didn't get one cycle of it

11
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:39,570
yeah yeah I did but going in the ground

12
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:43,920
on July 13th was you know two and a half

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:47,058
months late and I mean I had given up

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,770
like okay it's not happening this year

15
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:55,259
great I open up my mailbox it's like

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:01:00,140
this is wonderful this is wonderful this

17
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:03,089
is so exciting but wow what do I do now

18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,069
you know I have an order dirt I haven't

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,710
you know so how many cycles do you

20
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,289
typically have a year so this year we

21
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:12,298
did not do any light that situation

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,890
Santa Barbara you know didn't allow it

23
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:19,110
this year so we just applied for an

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,228
outdoor permit you know canopy permit

25
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:25,049
and then they issued my permit on July

26
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:27,900
11 and then they came out with a new

27
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,689
regulation that outdoor if we did light

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,090
death that we had to apply for a

29
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:36,019
mixed-use permit as if we had

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,020
supplemental life

31
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:43,519
you know it's just like just because

32
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:47,450
we're manipulating the time cycle with

33
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:49,250
another black cloth you're requiring me

34
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:53,689
to have a completely different permit

35
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,978
Wow you know great thank you like

36
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:59,989
another way for them to make money off

37
00:01:54,978 --> 00:02:02,299
you exactly exactly and you know Santa

38
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:04,009
Barbara has just been robbed they've

39
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:07,368
been really rough to deal with us as

40
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:10,699
have every other county here in the

41
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:15,590
nation I mean I would so in the next

42
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:22,039
nine days 3,500 grow permits are going

43
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:27,289
to expire statewide 3,500 of people who

44
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:32,930
have been under temporary and they have

45
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:35,479
no intention of issuing new temporary so

46
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:42,050
it's gonna be really interesting to see

47
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:47,689
what happens in nine days yeah which is

48
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:49,939
when we all want to be planning yeah do

49
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:53,150
you have any advocates in Sacramento

50
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:55,400
they're gonna help we yeah we do but you

51
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:59,439
know it's like the blind leading the

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,439
blind yeah

53
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:12,650
and they have no intention of issuing

54
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:14,179
you know we're on it every day of

55
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,020
issuing new temporaries

56
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:21,550
are they trying to just stop it yep

57
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:28,879
they're using regulation to shut it down

58
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:33,140
and there's no path forward this is

59
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:36,939
gonna be an interesting year no the last

60
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:36,939
two years have been interesting years

61
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:44,360
well Santa Barbara is not unique in any

62
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,209
way shape or form no they were the most

63
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:51,380
lenient in giving out temporary permits

64
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:54,229
I mean they handed out a lot but now

65
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:56,359
they've gotten Fish and Game Coastal

66
00:03:54,229 --> 00:04:01,389
Commission you know

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:04,519
EPA everybody else involved you know and

68
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,879
none of them know what to do with each

69
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,069
other

70
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:13,609
our our big holdup out there I call it

71
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:17,599
the catch 420 we applied to get a power

72
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:20,239
drop you know for for the field we paid

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,799
that seven thousand dollars to to the

74
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,668
power company they but it's on their

75
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:28,699
schedule then they came to us and said

76
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:32,620
we can't drop your transformer till you

77
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:36,649
have your land use permit in place

78
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:38,780
well then Santa Barbara came and they're

79
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:40,759
like well we can't issue your land use

80
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:44,779
permit till you have your security

81
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:48,259
cameras up and right well you explain to

82
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:50,389
me how we install security cameras and

83
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:53,060
make them up and running when we have no

84
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,849
power and you won't even tell us where

85
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,519
you're gonna put the transformer on the

86
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:01,430
property so we can't temporarily run the

87
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:06,529
power we can't do anything to that

88
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:09,530
location and then the Fish and Game is

89
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:11,449
coming and saying well you know we can

90
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:13,728
we can't issue and we can't sign off on

91
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:14,629
your land use permit until the power

92
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:16,789
company is strong

93
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:21,319
the power and you have your security

94
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:25,580
system in place so none of them will

95
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:28,370
sign the document or be the first one to

96
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:29,719
say hey you need a land use permit which

97
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,430
we've already been up and running we

98
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,320
already got a state permit we already

99
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:38,030
got a County permit but now they want

100
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:40,569
this permit further we have to have the

101
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:42,829
Indian consul come out do an

102
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:44,779
archaeological dig on the property to

103
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:47,329
make sure it wasn't some ancient hunting

104
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:48,829
ground or ancient burial ground and we

105
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:51,889
have to pay them fifteen thousand

106
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:54,229
dollars to bring their experts out to do

107
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:59,120
this day before Fish and Game won't sign

108
00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:00,680
off so it's the catch 420 they're like

109
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,439
yeah you sure you can do it we're gonna

110
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,600
create a great regulatory process where

111
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,879
this is going to be successful but we're

112
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,960
gonna make every agency out there have

113
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:13,399
the power to tell you go jump in a lake

114
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,079
yeah do you have a temporary for it

115
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,449
that's an expired a days we have a

116
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:25,279
temporary permit that expires in nine

117
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:27,560
days with no permit to give you not in

118
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,599
any way shape or form it's the blind

119
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,730
leading the blind is that the same for

120
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:37,520
him this hemp have a more likely

121
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:41,270
scenario to move forward well no no

122
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:43,399
because they put the Department of

123
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,959
Agriculture in charge of that one and

124
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:46,609
they were supposed to have their

125
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:51,229
regulations out but they are nowhere

126
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,069
close so you know we're all prepped and

127
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,009
ready to plant

128
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:58,509
we actually cracked seeds you know we're

129
00:06:55,009 --> 00:07:01,399
all ready and even that doesn't have a

130
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:06,170
legal path power in the state of

131
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:08,409
California the farm the you know they're

132
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,790
supposed to have their regulations done

133
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:14,689
supposedly by July 1st

134
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,629
they're not even close they're not even

135
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:21,139
close

136
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:23,839
so my confidence means that n with a

137
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:28,519
category three testing we're gonna have

138
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:30,619
a lack of supply in the market it's

139
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,979
gonna certainly affect that oversupply

140
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,870
problem oh yeah I mean there's a reason

141
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,300
that Rupert where it's booming right now

142
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,310
exactly exactly

143
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,740
there's a reason that you're Mitch but

144
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:46,009
even the traditional market there's a

145
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:49,009
lack supply out there right now right

146
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:52,009
now it's just like back in Paris and

147
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:55,789
distributors are becoming much nicer to

148
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:59,180
farmers oh yeah oh yeah and it was for a

149
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:02,810
long time farmers were just getting

150
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:06,519
raped you know I mean rate there I have

151
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,519
no other word for it
