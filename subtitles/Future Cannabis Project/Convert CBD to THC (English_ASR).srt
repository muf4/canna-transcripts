1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,588
converting CBD to THC

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:10,379
we're developing procedures SOPs around

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,620
that and then trying to build equipment

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,310
to do that something people commonly do

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:20,250
now so this is it's not commonly and

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:23,368
people do do it and it can be done so

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,800
you can take CBD and convert it to THC

8
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:27,980
yeah and I think that's a big future of

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,859
where the dose that's so lightly like a

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:34,619
like maybe four people currently are

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,859
doing anything that it's on such a small

12
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:39,479
scale and it doesn't actually work

13
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:41,759
correctly so you'll get like half

14
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,128
isomers from half your oil will be like

15
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,890
that converted oil some of it will be

16
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:49,439
some a Frankenstein a lot of it doesn't

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,980
see molecules a lot of its delta x and

18
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:57,030
some delta eight so doing it correctly

19
00:00:52,979 --> 00:01:00,589
to where you get a conversion from

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,730
second easiest ELCA 90hz is like is a

21
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,189
consistent conversion to at a very

22
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:10,429
specific yield meaning like the amount

23
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:12,959
of material that gets converted is like

24
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,450
changing and so many different like it's

25
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,489
the industry shaking revolutionized

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,259
everything so you think about those like

27
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:21,359
tens of hundreds of thousands of acres

28
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,400
in Colombia and Chile that grow him and

29
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:28,680
imagine the implications that it makes

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:32,700
for when when places actually start

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,060
legalizing THC like it takes how many

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,290
how long do grow a plant and then get to

33
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,299
currently it's something that isn't

34
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,030
really relevant because you can't grow a

35
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,070
hemp farm and then process and then

36
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,780
convert it to THC and sell it to the

37
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:50,849
teat the dispensary my future wait not

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:56,609
the future right now the USDA just

39
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:58,438
opined on that anything any compound

40
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:01,200
because of the farm bill derive from a

41
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,718
hemp plant is a legal compound and

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,310
because of the language in the in the

43
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:08,159
farm bill there needs no other

44
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,378
congressional approval like THC from

45
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,680
hemp and CBD from hemp are perfectly

46
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,899
legal compounds

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,579
for legal language which says you're

48
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,140
right your language anything that comes

49
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:18,969
from this yeah I knew that we could

50
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:22,539
convert it in this yes yeah there were

51
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:24,789
they're elitist no so that looks like

52
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:26,979
and I think if like the Senate Majority

53
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:29,229
Leader like Connell who's been pushing

54
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:30,128
him for a long time that is the backdoor

55
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:32,500
to legalization

56
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:35,768
that's why cannabis probably isn't legal

57
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,530
on a federal level he's a crafty old

58
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:40,539
geezer he's like the guy in every single

59
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,318
scooby-doo show you know and he's like

60
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:45,729
oh well you got me this time yeah

61
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:49,628
exactly

62
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:52,509
you dimed kids so if I understand

63
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:56,348
correctly you guys see a future where

64
00:02:52,509 --> 00:03:00,568
the massive massive amounts of hemp

65
00:02:56,348 --> 00:03:04,209
feels being grown can be converted to

66
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:07,869
THC which could end up in my vape

67
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:10,598
cartridge yeah and and actually people

68
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,629
are now starting to grow hemp for

69
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:16,810
terpene profiles if you if people are

70
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:18,578
worried about flavors and and

71
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,919
cannabinoid profiles

72
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:23,409
well flavor profiles can all be done

73
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:26,049
through breeding well you can you

74
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:29,530
eventually isolate those and then you

75
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:31,930
can isolate the terpenes and then from

76
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,419
there you grow different cultivars for

77
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:37,719
different cannabinoids and then we start

78
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:41,409
to isolate these cannabinoids and then

79
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:45,098
we can form them into a concentrate that

80
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:48,098
is tailored with the right concentration

81
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:59,348
for cannabinoids with a flavor profile

82
00:03:48,098 --> 00:04:01,298
that that's all natural actually doesn't

83
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:03,128
mean anything all-natural yeah it really

84
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,139
means really no there's really no

85
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:12,750
definition to all-natural you can it's

86
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:15,000
it's a market ideally I say anything

87
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,860
what cannabis and left boy you first

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,769
said all-natural so what's your definite

89
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,920
well I was I mean I was just saying

90
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,870
all-natural as like it was a really

91
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,390
stupid thing for me to say I didn't mean

92
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,860
all that I met I met cannabis derived or

93
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:35,479
have derived so yeah it's a terpenes

94
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,480
coming from the plans
