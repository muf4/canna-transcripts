1
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:29,230
speaking about how things have to be

2
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:34,950
helpful like I've seen a lot of

3
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,950
advertising when they were trying to the

4
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,948
OE so the question was we still face the

5
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,070
stigma as cannabis and is it helpful

6
00:00:56,948 --> 00:01:02,198
versus harmful essentially and yeah

7
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,259
application is our is is our biggest

8
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:07,390
Boulder you know there's just a real

9
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:08,769
lack of everyone has a strong opinion

10
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,750
these days and not a lot of information

11
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,799
and the less information they have is

12
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,340
stronger their opinion it's the

13
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:18,489
dunning-kruger effect of the world so so

14
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,380
yeah it's really difficult and it's just

15
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:23,019
I don't know I mean I could talk for an

16
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:25,089
hour just on that alone but yeah I'm

17
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:27,219
sure you experienced as well same things

18
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,439
going on with vaccines is a lot of

19
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:31,810
disinformation so I'm doing exemptions

20
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,728
and I'm just getting fought like Oh

21
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,590
vaccines are safe and effective that's

22
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:39,340
the end of the story well it's not so

23
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:42,340
anyway with this it's it's if you really

24
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:46,299
research cannabis you'll find out that

25
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,130
it's very safe and effective but and we

26
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:50,890
keep running into the stuff like it's

27
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:53,649
not legal and and force getting blocked

28
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,420
because Governor Brown wants his taxes

29
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:58,689
and all that kind of craziness it's like

30
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:03,368
wait a minute wait what about these kids

31
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:06,008
so yeah I will say I will say also

32
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:08,860
though that that's like charities and

33
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:10,449
attach mark is so important because that

34
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,239
all changes when your loved one gets

35
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:15,399
sick so I've had people from the

36
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,409
Sheriff's Department who yelled at me at

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,209
one meeting and called me two months

38
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:22,120
later when their nephew started seizing

39
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:23,860
and we help them secretly because

40
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,900
they're afraid I've had families from

41
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,680
Beale Air Force Base call me terrified

42
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,420
they're going to give

43
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,129
that's scared for their loved ones life

44
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:32,348
I've had families from the fire

45
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:33,878
department churches or they're afraid

46
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:36,429
their church group it's a cultural thing

47
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:38,949
that really shelters they shelter

48
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,819
themselves against being educated about

49
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:47,318
it unfortunately and when they come to

50
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:50,708
us we help any child like you know say

51
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:52,899
no to right so what I will say is as

52
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:56,199
that happens their paradigm shifts

53
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,780
immediately when they start to see

54
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,318
results even if you know not a canvas

55
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,180
isn't magic it doesn't save every life

56
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:06,310
but it improves their quality of life

57
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,919
especially to those with terminal

58
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,109
illness so the kids who can smile again

59
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,000
ease their suffering even though they're

60
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:15,400
not gonna make it some brain cancers

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,919
very well success rate but the

62
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,709
difference in those days it's just as

63
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,569
powerful it's not all about if if it's

64
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,519
not gonna save you don't do it there's

65
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:28,089
something special will be said for just

66
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:31,509
easy suffering in our communities and

67
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,549
when you experience that firsthand all

68
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:36,039
that silliness goes out the window the

69
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:37,750
problem is the people with the strongest

70
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,459
opinions said who end up harming the

71
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,019
most people with those misinformed

72
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:43,000
opinions they haven't had those

73
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:46,090
experiences you know and it's very

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,590
difficult to teach that without that

75
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:52,269
person and experience especially when

76
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:54,930
they're unwilling to listen we have time

77
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,930
for what do we got

78
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:29,028
[Music]

79
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:40,500
okay well so high camera so we're shut

80
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,849
down

81
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,160
we can't I can't accept donations but

82
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,610
with that being said you can't give away

83
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,400
candidates in in products in California

84
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,740
and what we have to do and I'm still a

85
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,539
father whose son needs medicine and I

86
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,930
know a lot of families who do need

87
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,810
medicine so I think that legally we can

88
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,418
absolutely connect donations with where

89
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:09,379
they need to go it's just extremely

90
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:12,299
cumbersome because we can't function as

91
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:14,730
the middle man for that to help

92
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,470
facilitate that process so so what I

93
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,080
would say to people who want to donate

94
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,030
cannabis there's always someone who

95
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,449
could benefit from your gift and I think

96
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:26,129
that working with cannabis that's rooted

97
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,469
in the spirit of working with cannabis

98
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:29,969
whether it's kids what you know what's

99
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,350
your passion whether it's veterans

100
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,660
whether it's seniors whether it's

101
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,610
hospice care right whether it's mental

102
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,350
health there's somewhere that you could

103
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,870
take that work and a portion of that can

104
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,300
benefit and uplift your community and so

105
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,560
there's ways to do that and it's just

106
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,730
connecting with the patients and if you

107
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,889
have things that you'd like to get with

108
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,870
to families of kids who need it I could

109
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:52,159
we could connect you in a way where we

110
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,160
could do that legally and responsibly

111
00:05:52,579 --> 00:06:00,938
I would like to make a comment see if

112
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:03,529
you guys are both comfortable with it

113
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:06,319
one of the things that I think is really

114
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:08,179
good about this being the first panel or

115
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,199
one of the first discussions of this day

116
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:15,288
is the medical use of cannabis really is

117
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,180
at the heart of cannabis the

118
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:19,300
legalization efforts that's happened in

119
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,370
California over the last 20-some years

120
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,038
started because of the medical benefit

121
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,019
of cannabis people's direct experience

122
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,990
showed them that the prohibitionists

123
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:32,870
propaganda was right in my

124
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,550
language and we've moved the

125
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,168
conversation a lot not just here in our

126
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,030
local jurisdiction but across the state

127
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:41,029
and across the world for that matter and

128
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:43,459
its medical that's helping to change

129
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:45,709
that story and we all appreciate I

130
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:48,378
appreciate the as it's called

131
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:51,918
recreational or inspirational aspects of

132
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:54,289
cannabis but the real movement on this

133
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:58,189
question around prohibition had to do

134
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:59,959
with legitimate medical use and one of

135
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:02,629
the real tragedies of California

136
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,489
legalization is despite 20-some years of

137
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:09,289
actual practical experience of seeing

138
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:11,930
cannabis work as medicine state law has

139
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:13,930
basically dismantled all that mechanism

140
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,209
that was created across our state and

141
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:19,519
you as individuals can reach out to your

142
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:21,769
elected officials both locally and at

143
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:25,098
the state level and make them aware of

144
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:26,750
this problem like I said the need did

145
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:29,899
not go away just because the rules

146
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,418
changed and they are supposed to listen

147
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:34,908
to us they are our representatives but

148
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:37,399
you need to stand up and speak for some

149
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:42,228
of these families some of our children

150
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:44,120
who need this as medicine and pardon my

151
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,588
little rant there but one last thing I

152
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,908
want to say is in the conversation about

153
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:51,860
CBD I wanted to pop up and just say I

154
00:07:48,908 --> 00:07:53,870
tend to think of CBD and I've been

155
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,259
playing with it for a number of years

156
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,470
and

157
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:02,969
it is the part of cannabis that helps me

158
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:05,220
and others feel good there's nothing

159
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,650
wrong with feeling good it's actually a

160
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,480
good thing and there's way too many

161
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:14,219
things in our life that want us to feel

162
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:19,680
bad and scared and driven and this plant

163
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:22,800
is in fact truly a killing plant and so

164
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,810
that's I guess all I got on that and I I

165
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,360
would ask if either you want to say

166
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:31,379
anything else before we wrap up any

167
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,779
questions about anything else that are

168
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:39,469
we out of time or interest or where are

169
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:42,899
we at this point technically late

170
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,620
so so let me just try to wrap up with

171
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,230
some thoughts

172
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,940
one is that cannabis can treat darn near

173
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,430
anything especially if you know what

174
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,490
you're doing the research is coming

175
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:56,009
along slowly but surely a lot of its

176
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,889
overseas Israel is a real hub of good

177
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:01,500
research I've got some good research on

178
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:04,019
the effects of cannabis and autism and

179
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,289
in dementia and in a whole lot other

180
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,720
things and it's really looking good so

181
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:13,559
that's great we've got all these new

182
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,019
cannabinoids being discovered as we go

183
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,839
along I think one of the things that

184
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:22,169
needs to happen is that these plants

185
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:25,950
need to be bred for higher whatever it

186
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:28,319
is CBG as an example higher Mersin which

187
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,930
is one of the terpenes and all that so

188
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,180
that they're more effective CBD plants

189
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:34,739
are way more effective than then the

190
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:38,009
ones that didn't have any CBD in them

191
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,950
for CVD purposes or what about CBG

192
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:42,929
purposes or cbc all that all that stuff

193
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,960
what about the terpenes and all that's

194
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:49,169
anyway I'm looking for those of you that

195
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,960
are interested in this to keep looking

196
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:55,079
at this and go okay what's the next CBD

197
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,120
and how do I read it and grow it and

198
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,240
make it available at a decent price

199
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,549
because you will benefit well so will

200
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,940
the patient so we could have better pain

201
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:07,490
relieving cannabis better

202
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:10,060
anxiety relieving canvas a lot better

203
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,549
sleep cannabis then we have I think

204
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:14,000
wouldn't you guys with me on this and

205
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:15,409
okay good

206
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,450
looks like they're in agreement so good

207
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:19,809
I didn't go way out before good so

208
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:23,540
anyway that's where we need to go and

209
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:26,329
I'd say if you're in the game study some

210
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:29,480
of the science about this and see okay

211
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:31,610
yeah and if you need resources on that

212
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,460
you know talk to me or forest or wait

213
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,970
and there's some pretty good stuff out

214
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:47,309
there thank you so much

215
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:47,309
