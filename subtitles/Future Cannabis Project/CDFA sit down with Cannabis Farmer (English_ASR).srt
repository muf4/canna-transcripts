00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:20,519
[Music]

4
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:28,618
thanks for out here good how are you I'm

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,599
Richard paradigm the director of the Cal

6
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:31,890
cannabis cultivation licensing division

7
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,950
for California Department of Food and

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,230
Agriculture well we were just discussing

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,320
a few minutes ago about kind of how

10
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:43,078
things have been going so far in 2018

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,909
and some of the challenges that that

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,660
we've all been dealing with really and

13
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:51,148
trying to see how we can just

14
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:53,640
communicate and have some conversation

15
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,730
around some solutions and maybe some

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,969
ideas and see where we can go from here

17
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:02,608
it's been an interesting year

18
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,060
and I don't think any of us knew really

19
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,010
what to expect when we voted prop 64 in

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,340
fully we thought oh well you know we've

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:15,659
been in this prop 215 for many years

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,340
since 98 was it and you know myself as a

23
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,740
farmer had been working under that

24
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,820
medical model for many years in my

25
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:26,519
County actually had a 99 plant limit for

26
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:29,429
many years and so we cultivated under

27
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,890
that for a while and as soon as there

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,900
was anything you know a legal road to go

29
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,969
down we chose that option and we've been

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,409
working towards that ever since okay and

31
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:39,239
it's been a you know it's been a real

32
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,070
challenge because it's it's like here

33
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,989
you're pulling people from the total

34
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,758
darkness who didn't want to be regulated

35
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,739
wanted to hide out in the country and

36
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,489
grow their cannabis and and do their

37
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:53,099
thing into this total light world and

38
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:54,569
you know into the white market and a lot

39
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:57,209
of people weren't ready for it a lot of

40
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,938
people dabble in it and they're kind of

41
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:02,129
not sure if it's for them and and you

42
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:04,679
know from my perspective in Mendocino

43
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:07,420
County we have a you know a lot of

44
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,590
cultivators as you probably know

45
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,719
and it's been a real big topic

46
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,729
conversation around like so are you are

47
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,379
you gonna get licensed oh no well I

48
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:19,090
don't know if I want to do that you know

49
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:21,310
and so everybody's having these these

50
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,800
inner internal conversations within you

51
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,840
know the community about is it right for

52
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,300
them and whether they want to do it and

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,120
so I operate mendocino direct

54
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:34,270
generations which is a group of about

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,629
sixty farms and Mendo okay and so I try

56
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,640
to help people become licensed figure

57
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:42,189
out you know the right way to do things

58
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,289
interpret the regulations and apply them

59
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:45,819
basically and and help them get to

60
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,250
market we have a couple brands and stuff

61
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:53,219
but we do a lot of farmer education

62
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:58,650
around everything tracking trays to

63
00:02:53,219 --> 00:03:01,449
pesticides and farming techniques and so

64
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,219
I really want to see my friends and

65
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:07,329
neighbors survive I really want them to

66
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:08,949
get legal and get you know get out there

67
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,590
and get their license and they they've

68
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:15,669
come across a lot of hiccups along the

69
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:17,110
way like we were saying before and one

70
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:19,119
of the biggest challenges is at the

71
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,010
county level and I know you're obviously

72
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,890
working at the state level right do you

73
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:28,078
work with the county officials closely

74
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:30,939
to help them learn and implement these

75
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:33,879
yes we do and that's one of the unique

76
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:36,459
things about this new system or this new

77
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:39,759
world that we're in starting in 2018

78
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,620
with having the dual licensing right

79
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,439
with both state and local licenses

80
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,719
that's one of the issues we've seen this

81
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,900
year as we've started to take

82
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,430
applications for temporary licenses is

83
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,280
seeing people from the industry having

84
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,590
difficulty getting their local license

85
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,039
so we've been out there working with the

86
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,989
local governments we've gone up north to

87
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,389
the Emerald triangle and done training

88
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:06,519
with the local officials staff to

89
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:08,619
explain how it works it at our state

90
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:09,760
level what our requirements are

91
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,150
understanding what the local

92
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,310
requirements are and really helping them

93
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,009
to be able to educate the farmers when

94
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,920
they come in

95
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:20,899
and say how do I get started so we've

96
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,740
been doing that but we realized that

97
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:27,019
there's like you said we've gone from

98
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:32,360
nothing to everything overnight without

99
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:35,359
a real type of phase in and so we did we

100
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,210
went from we went from you know when I

101
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,660
started at Cal cannabis in it was in

102
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:44,449
August of 2017 we had 10 people and we

103
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,310
have about close to 80 today so we've

104
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:48,829
really scaled up and had to also

105
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,019
implement you know to IT systems are

106
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:53,000
online licensing and the track and trace

107
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:54,620
in a very short amount of time to get

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,230
everything ready for the industry so

109
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,840
it's been a lot in a very short amount

110
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,270
of time and like you said a lot of

111
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:06,979
unforeseen obstacles in 2018 that we've

112
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:09,680
had to all overcome and it's been a

113
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,110
learning experience I think for all of

114
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,170
us you know and the other thing is the

115
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,930
difficulty with going from emergency

116
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:21,439
regulations to re-adopt in emergency

117
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:25,310
regulations and now to propose permanent

118
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,629
regulations what my hope is for 2019 is

119
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,339
with these proposed permanent

120
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:30,199
regulations out there once we get

121
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:32,479
through the process with Office of

122
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,769
Administrative Law and the regulations

123
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,890
become final

124
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:39,409
that's our you know we really we've been

125
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:42,769
trying to be heavy on education but

126
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,650
really having more types of materials

127
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:47,479
for the farmers to understand what the

128
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:52,269
regulations mean it's hard to pick up a

129
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:55,160
packet of 76 pages of text and read it

130
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:59,810
most recent changes it was like 31

131
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:03,320
binders I think that was the bureau's

132
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:06,319
but maybe from the bureau's social media

133
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,819
page we didn't have as as many but we

134
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,529
had a couple boxes that we've dropped

135
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:11,000
off as well of all the reference

136
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:13,369
material and everything it took to get

137
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,370
to where we are today it's been a heavy

138
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,829
lift but I also understand we understand

139
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,389
how hard it's been for the folks out

140
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:24,109
there that are trying to get licensed

141
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:26,250
and we too are there to help people get

142
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,770
into the legal system

143
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,269
you know we have people that we have

144
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:33,259
people that are staffing an 800 number

145
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:36,359
that were and we answer emails every day

146
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:37,680
I've been really really when I'm

147
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,840
speaking at events I've been really

148
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,629
pushing to have people who are applying

149
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:47,069
for a state license call us if they have

150
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:48,389
questions before they apply yeah read

151
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:49,949
our reference materials we have a lot of

152
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:52,050
good reference materials we have guides

153
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,399
to you know the application attachments

154
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,170
guides to how to fill out the

155
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,169
cultivation plan but I've been really

156
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,550
really focusing on having people call us

157
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,740
or email us if they're not sure before

158
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,960
they apply that way their application

159
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,939
could get through a lot more efficiently

160
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:08,219
yeah you know I'm seeing some at the

161
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:09,449
county level in Mendocino County a lot

162
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,130
of people are getting hung up at the

163
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:13,379
building and planning so they really

164
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:14,850
want to be selling their cannabis on a

165
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,980
legal market and and they might even

166
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,900
have cannabis that they just harvested

167
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:23,700
right but yet they cannot sell it

168
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:25,620
because they can't get through yeah and

169
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,110
we understand and that is the the

170
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,720
uniqueness of the dual licensing as they

171
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,120
do need to get through local you know

172
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,850
for the temporary licenses it was a must

173
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,860
you have to have a local permit license

174
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,710
or other type of authorization for the

175
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,230
annual license you don't have to provide

176
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:44,849
that but we still notify the locals when

177
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,950
we get a state application and we have

178
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:49,740
to ensure that the applicant won't be in

179
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:52,409
violation of any local ordinances or

180
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,210
rules and so there is that communication

181
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,520
with the local local government and so

182
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:58,500
if someone isn't in compliance the

183
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,029
locals will let us know and then we

184
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,910
can't we don't move forward until we

185
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:04,769
hear from the locals is there any things

186
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,330
that you're looking forward to

187
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:08,549
implementing that might make this system

188
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:10,680
just a little bit smoother for farmers

189
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,129
so that we can I know it that we were

190
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,480
supposed to have this on a head start as

191
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:17,839
cultivators we're gonna get ahead of the

192
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,449
game before the big guys came in

193
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,519
yeah I think that we're you know we're

194
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:24,650
we're obviously going to be focusing on

195
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,629
more coordination with local governments

196
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:29,509
one of the things that we'll be doing as

197
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:31,579
we get into 2019 because we'll be

198
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,250
issuing annual licenses but also

199
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:35,629
provisional licenses and I don't know if

200
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,690
you've talked at all about the

201
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:40,338
provisional licenses those are intended

202
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,349
to help applicants that are in a

203
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:45,230
jurisdiction where they're not totally

204
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:48,589
ready or done with their California

205
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,839
Environmental Quality Act so so if a

206
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:52,700
local government doesn't have their

207
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,700
sequel process complete but they're in

208
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,950
the process they that applicant would

209
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,180
qualify for a provisional license and

210
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:03,110
that would allow them to sell their

211
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:05,989
cannabis yep they would be still paying

212
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,700
the the annual license fee the annual

213
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:11,750
license application fee but they'd be

214
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,070
able to have a state license and they

215
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,799
would be in the track and trace system

216
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,710
as well what we'll be doing in 2019 is

217
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:20,539
as we see those jurisdictions that

218
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,600
aren't done with sequa and they're there

219
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:25,278
their applicants are candidates for

220
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,440
provisional licenses we're gonna be

221
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,179
doing education with those local

222
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,490
governments about how they can get their

223
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:33,979
sequel process done so we're gonna be

224
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,990
basically you know going on the road and

225
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,720
helping educate the local governments

226
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,240
how they get ready and then another

227
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,700
thing for the small growers we had a

228
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,409
some one of our supervisors was speaking

229
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,200
here yesterday about our appellations

230
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:49,939
program that's coming in 2021 and

231
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,240
that'll be that's something that we see

232
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:56,720
is really you know going to be more for

233
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,250
the craft grower the small grower where

234
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,500
you know we're talking about

235
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,080
appellations of standards practices and

236
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,259
varietals and i know that that's been

237
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,639
very well received in the by this by the

238
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:09,919
smaller growers is something that they

239
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:12,019
see really benefitting them yeah I

240
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,208
actually had some of the the people who

241
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:17,649
are working in that department come to

242
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:20,088
my farm and they did their very first

243
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:22,879
they had a lot of fun we educated them

244
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:26,060
on Swami was there and we cut it through

245
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:28,068
and really you know that was my team I

246
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,539
would I think I had a conflicting

247
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:31,429
engagement otherwise I was going to be

248
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:36,409
there with them so hopefully I can come

249
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:40,879
back up we're really just wanting to

250
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:42,828
open communication and you know show you

251
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,470
guys what it's like to live our

252
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:49,909
lifestyle and cultivate cannabis and

253
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:51,379
that we're not like weirdos really like

254
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:53,750
we're like everybody else and we just

255
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:57,198
you know we really love to show off our

256
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:59,269
work when talking about applying from

257
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:01,099
the state level because I know that

258
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:03,549
there there are some obstacles at the

259
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,569
local level but from the smaller farmers

260
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:07,429
when they're applying for the state

261
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:10,129
license are have you heard of anything

262
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:11,899
where there's areas that need to be

263
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:14,629
cleared up or areas where they're having

264
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:16,549
difficulty you know we're trying to make

265
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:17,419
sure we have enough information out

266
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:19,159
there to help them through the process

267
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:20,629
but have you heard of any areas where

268
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,909
they're struggling or need more help

269
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:24,980
from us I feel like a lot of people feel

270
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:26,899
like that like customer service has been

271
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,789
really good and the website is a little

272
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:33,019
hard to navigate I think a little bit

273
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:34,429
more education would be very helpful and

274
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:36,980
that's just basically I think the

275
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:39,469
biggest problem is interpreting the

276
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,449
regulations and and boiling it down to

277
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,850
some really basic points yeah I think

278
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:46,008
that would help people a lot but I think

279
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,629
one of the the biggest things was we

280
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:50,028
were under the impression that the micro

281
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:52,610
business license would be something that

282
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:54,919
would be available to all small farmers

283
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,560
that we could really get an edge up on

284
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:58,309
the regulated market we could have our

285
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:00,409
own just

286
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:02,359
we could have our own manufacturing we

287
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:04,969
could process we could package and we

288
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,459
could pull to date and/or have a retail

289
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,290
right and I think a lot of people have

290
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,578
that in mind myself included in that I

291
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:14,299
really wanted to do that because I

292
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:16,729
already had a couple of brands for

293
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:18,948
various like a topicals company and such

294
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:22,188
and I'm really just like an entrepreneur

295
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:23,599
and I just love to like you know do that

296
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:25,490
kind of stuff and so I thought well

297
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,490
that's perfect for me I really want to

298
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:31,579
do that and but it turns out in my

299
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:35,299
County Mendocino County I cannot get the

300
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:37,489
correct I can't get that permit because

301
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:39,349
of my buildings basically so I'm in the

302
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,558
wrong zone it's not allowed in my zone

303
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,329
and so here I am somebody who really

304
00:12:42,558 --> 00:12:46,039
wants to be doing this I can't afford to

305
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:47,688
buy a new piece of property nor would I

306
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:50,328
want to move or any of that kind of

307
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:53,299
thing and so I want to be able to just

308
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:55,549
basically do what was working well for

309
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:57,349
me right and just keep going with it

310
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:59,539
instead of this stop start that's been

311
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,490
happening and so in my community tons of

312
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:05,240
people would do the micro business if

313
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:07,759
they could we could really work on that

314
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,409
that would help small farmers a great

315
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,269
deal I think a lot of people would go

316
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:13,549
for getting a micro business license and

317
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:15,259
you know the micro business licenses are

318
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:18,019
under purview of the Bureau of cannabis

319
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:19,490
control because as you know there are

320
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:21,259
three licensing authorities in

321
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,759
California but we work very very closely

322
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,470
with the bureau

323
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:27,169
I attend all of the cannabis advisory

324
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,089
committee meetings and the last meeting

325
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:32,088
that was earlier this year the last

326
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:33,889
meeting for 2018 that was a topic of

327
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:36,500
discussion that's going to be picked up

328
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:38,509
at this next meeting I believe in 2019

329
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,269
to really continue that discussion about

330
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:43,370
micro business I'll be there part of the

331
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:47,778
discussion and working with the bureau

332
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:50,178
and you know doing what we can to try

333
00:13:47,778 --> 00:13:52,578
and help that along that was that was a

334
00:13:50,178 --> 00:13:56,240
big topic of discussion people talking

335
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:58,528
about the vision that industry had isn't

336
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,739
really what's there right now

337
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:04,879
and I think that's also you know broken

338
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:08,548
promises about like the one acre cap to

339
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,658
when I asked my constituency about like

340
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,999
what do you want me to ask Richard

341
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:14,369
parrot and they're all like oh make sure

342
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:16,859
you ask him about why what happened

343
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:18,928
there what happened with the drop of the

344
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:21,389
one acre cat yeah and that one is still

345
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:23,938
under litigation and I'm not trying to

346
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:26,579
hide behind it but but because it is in

347
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:29,938
litigation and I've had I've had to

348
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:32,399
answer this question at legislative

349
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:36,688
hearings I had to answer the question

350
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:40,288
earlier this year at a public hearing in

351
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:41,788
Ukiah and I got in it I don't know if

352
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:45,418
you were there was in it was Martin

353
00:14:41,788 --> 00:14:47,698
March it was a joint legislative hearing

354
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:50,928
with Senator McGuire and assembly member

355
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:53,248
wood and because we're being sued

356
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:55,198
because we're being sued

357
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:58,439
I can't I'm not able to discuss it

358
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,878
because it is being litigated so for the

359
00:14:58,438 --> 00:15:01,769
record I've been advised by our legal

360
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:04,278
office that I'm not able to discuss it

361
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:04,278
I'm sorry

362
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:11,459
the farmers felt like we were gonna get

363
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:14,068
a leg up and we were gonna be able to

364
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:15,628
cruise for a little while until these

365
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:18,178
larger corporations were allowed to

366
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:20,579
start stacking licenses and and all

367
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:22,889
these kinds of things and I already kind

368
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:25,608
of see that happening and it's it's

369
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:29,879
disturbing in my area I'm seeing farmers

370
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:30,959
jump ship okay and I think mostly it's

371
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:32,970
because they just don't have the money

372
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,408
to scale up and nor do they want the

373
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,089
headache and they just feel like well

374
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:37,470
maybe the universe is telling me it's

375
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:39,179
time to do something else with my life

376
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,619
and but they might be you know some of

377
00:15:39,178 --> 00:15:42,269
my neighbors and friends they might be

378
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:45,028
like 65 years old and they're starting

379
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:47,849
fresh with a new what am I going to do

380
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:49,708
now right and so that's my concern wise

381
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:52,429
with my community and my neighbors and

382
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:55,828
my friends and and I really you know I

383
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:58,379
want to see them all thrive yeah a long

384
00:15:55,828 --> 00:16:01,318
term yeah well that's that's I mean

385
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:03,298
that's good for us to know we did we did

386
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:06,478
you know receive a lot of comments about

387
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:08,458
the acreage cap to as during our

388
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:11,399
rulemaking process so all that

389
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:13,048
information is out on the Department of

390
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,298
Food Network cultures website now it was

391
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:17,188
all released on December 7th so the

392
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:19,769
draft final language and all of the

393
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:21,418
responses to comments were actually

394
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:25,369
published on the website so those are

395
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:25,369
out there for people to review as well I

396
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,889
wanted to ask you about nursery licenses

397
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:33,088
because that is part of the cultivation

398
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,829
license right

399
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:37,589
I personally applied for a nursery

400
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:39,508
license and I have a lot of people in my

401
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:42,389
constituency in Mendocino generations

402
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:43,889
who have an application in for that but

403
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:45,629
in our community as well there's a lot

404
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:47,609
of people who have that for seed

405
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:50,629
production and whether or not they're

406
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:53,339
selling plants or clones to anybody else

407
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:55,168
they just want that license so that they

408
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:57,329
can keep the genetics alive and they can

409
00:16:55,168 --> 00:17:01,588
make seeds and and keep the heritage

410
00:16:57,328 --> 00:17:03,478
alive really ultimately and so do you

411
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:06,119
know much about what's coming for the

412
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:09,449
nursery licenses I feel like we feel

413
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:11,128
we're all kind of in the dark about what

414
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,778
we can and can't do the regulations

415
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:15,599
around the nursery is still a little bit

416
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:17,970
murky yeah that's one of the things is

417
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,548
you know with with the emergency

418
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,130
regulations going through to are the

419
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:24,049
original version

420
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,819
and then the read option and now having

421
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:27,259
our permanent regulations those are

422
00:17:25,818 --> 00:17:30,710
things that we'll be focusing on getting

423
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:32,660
more almost like I'm envisioning almost

424
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,660
like one or two-page fact sheets about

425
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,920
different parts of our licensing and

426
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,650
that's what we're gonna be working

427
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,779
toward and also you you talked about our

428
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,150
website earlier it's there's a lot of

429
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:47,210
information and we just have one huge

430
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:50,060
page on our website we're in the process

431
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:52,160
of revamping the entire Department of

432
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:54,559
Food and Agriculture website and for the

433
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,230
Cal cannabis division we'll have new

434
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,129
information that will be a lot more user

435
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:03,589
friendly and kind of organized in ways

436
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:06,110
that that I'm hoping the applicants of

437
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:08,750
the industry would find easier to use in

438
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:10,879
reference but we're gonna be shooting

439
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,529
for is almost like fact sheets on

440
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,350
different topics and nurseries will be

441
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:16,819
one of them yeah I'm looking forward to

442
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:20,149
finding out more about it I haven't

443
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:23,389
doped too far into figuring it out I

444
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:26,269
just applied for it and you know always

445
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:28,550
if there's questions just call us call

446
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:30,589
us or email us or although we're super

447
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:33,559
busy our stuff are we're answering the

448
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:35,059

449
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:36,649
responding to emails so if you're not

450
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:41,019
sure about something call us or email us

451
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:47,120
and we're more than happy to help about

452
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:48,829
phase three testing of the year do you

453
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,769
have any insight for us as to how you

454
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:53,720
see that playing out I don't because

455
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:56,809
that the testing is under the bureau but

456
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,850
they Bureau oversees the testing labs

457
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:01,730
and the testing process

458
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:03,949
we're definitely you know following it

459
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,720
but I don't have any any specific

460
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:10,250
information about Phase three but will

461
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:12,170
be will be definitely following you know

462
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,789
they were worried about the whole

463
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,480
testing thing in general and I actually

464
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:18,649
been seeing that it's it's better and

465
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,710
we're having more

466
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:24,500
you know good results from it in general

467
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:26,630
but you know with the track and trace

468
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,460
like being implemented we haven't really

469
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,200
got there with the farmers besides right

470
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,509
and I know you wanted to talk about

471
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,580
track and trade sure yeah just I think

472
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:36,169
there's been a lot of maybe

473
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:38,329
misunderstanding about track and trace

474
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:40,130
we keep hearing that people are saying

475
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:41,359
when's it going to be launched when will

476
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:44,450
it be alive

477
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:47,750
it was live at the start of January at

478
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,730
the start of 2018 annual licensees will

479
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,919
be using track and trace not temporary

480
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,990
licensees there were a lot of questions

481
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,590
as to why we chose that but when you

482
00:19:53,990 --> 00:20:00,079
look back at 2018 and you look at our

483
00:19:57,589 --> 00:20:01,819
original emergency regulations than a

484
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,710
readapted version of the emergency

485
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:06,678
regulations and now our draft permanent

486
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,569
regulations with so many changes and so

487
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,730
many things to be learned during the

488
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:13,278
temporary licensing process if we had

489
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,470
had the temporary licensees in track and

490
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:17,929
trace that would have been I think

491
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,429
harder on the industry because with

492
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:22,038
cultivation what we found are a lot of

493
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:23,240
cultivators got let's just talk about at

494
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:25,190
the beginning of the year they've got

495
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,390
both a.m. licenses because they weren't

496
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,990
sure which way they were going to go

497
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,278
when we readapted the regulations and

498
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,009
clarified that you could eat have either

499
00:20:31,278 --> 00:20:36,200
a or an M and it didn't matter you could

500
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:37,849
sell to either an AR em a lot of them

501
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,679
made decisions wha I only need one

502
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:41,119
license that would have been a lot of

503
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,759
maintenance in the track and trade

504
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:46,788
system people retag implants retaining

505
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,579
product so annual licensees will be

506
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:51,558
using track and trace we have between

507
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:53,418
the three licenses once they're proof

508
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:56,119
between the three licensing authorities

509
00:20:53,419 --> 00:21:00,110
we've issued 23 annual licenses so far

510
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:02,689
and about 17 have actually been

511
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:04,279
credentialed and are in the system so

512
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,799
those are going to be our first users

513
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:08,839
when we get into 2019 and we're you know

514
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,579
we'll be done issuing temporary licenses

515
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:14,149
at the end of this year and then our

516
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:16,220
authority goes away so as in 2019 we'll

517
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,259
be issuing a lot more annual and

518
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,769
provisional licenses then we'll see

519
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:23,450
people flowing in to track and trace and

520
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:25,400
they'll be using it and I know in your

521
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,400
jurisdiction you also have a local track

522
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:32,480
entry system as well we had sick Pat cow

523
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,880
origin and you know that was a whole

524
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,910
crazy thing in itself I was actually the

525
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,640
12th permit in Mendocino County and so I

526
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:44,509
was thrown into that right in harvest of

527
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,960
last year okay and you know we did our

528
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:49,490
best and it was really complicated

529
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,370
mostly the the biggest complication was

530
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:56,839
actually just learning the system that

531
00:21:52,369 --> 00:22:00,229
you know their website but it felt like

532
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:02,470
to me that the track and trace just kind

533
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,299
of came to an end that sticker was

534
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,860
really unusable after it went to my

535
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:08,119
distributor for instance they said well

536
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:10,250
what am I gonna do with this because

537
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:12,559
they weren't using the same system okay

538
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,089
and so the Buc kind of stopped there and

539
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,440
they just threw that package away and

540
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:18,230
they put it in my packaging and they

541
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,019
didn't put a new sticker on it because

542
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:22,279
they weren't in metric yet okay so it

543
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:24,889
was just kind of like why are we doing

544
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:28,819
this when it just stopped

545
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:31,009
yeah we've been we've been you know we

546
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:34,069
talked with all of the third-party

547
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:35,930
vendors Sigma is one and so they're

548
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:38,069
working on being able to interface with

549
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,590
metric for their

550
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:42,689
the licensees that are youth that are on

551
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:45,089
a local system so they're there working

552
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,830
on having their Cal origin system be

553
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:49,589
able to integrate with metric so and we

554
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:51,179
you know talk to them frequently I know

555
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:53,519
that they've done what they need to do

556
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:56,610
to get certified to be able to interface

557
00:22:53,519 --> 00:23:00,150
with metric so and the goal is there for

558
00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:03,029
those licensees that are in a local

559
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:05,580
system to as much as we can limit any

560
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:08,509
duplication of entry and duplication of

561
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:17,460
effort so we're working on that too I

562
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:19,799
appreciate your time thank you you know

563
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:24,090
I think that the biggest advice would be

564
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:27,960
to you know we're all in it together

565
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:30,990
we're all working together I'm my hope

566
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,179
is at 2019 we're through I think the

567
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,319
heaviest lift on getting the regulations

568
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:37,470
done

569
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:40,200
I see 2019 hopefully as a time for us to

570
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:42,808
really work on education and starting to

571
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,269
try and you know work out the kinks in

572
00:23:42,808 --> 00:23:48,869
our systems really have engagement with

573
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:50,579
industry with all the licensees be able

574
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:53,609
to hear from them and look at things

575
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:55,829
that can be fixed and tweaked along the

576
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:58,169
way I continue to tell everyone what we

577
00:23:55,829 --> 00:24:02,819
put out is our start this isn't how the

578
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:04,710
program is going to that's the good

579
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:06,599
thing about regulations is that we can

580
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,579
you know do subsequent we're all making

581
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:12,429
efforts to fix things as

582
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:14,079
move along I always say this isn't what

583
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,970
the program is gonna look like a year

584
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,409
from now two years from now even three

585
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,870
years from now things are gonna change

586
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,910
in morphus we all learn more and figure

587
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:24,909
out what's working and what's not so I'd

588
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:27,279
say you know hang in there with us and

589
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:29,860
communicate with us and if you know if

590
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,170
you all have questions call us and we're

591
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:33,459
there to listen and work together to you

592
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,400
know their goal is to get as many people

593
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,700
into the legal system as we can that'll

594
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,700
be better

595
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:53,090
