1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,278
i just want to show you around the

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,798
side of my house here we've got a blue

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:07,919
mat system in this little greenhouse we

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,839
use this greenhouse for a lot of like

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,879
kind of test projects

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,080
um the whole thing starts right here

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,839
with a

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,118
blue map pressure reducer and then we

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,560
jump up to this half inch poly tubing

10
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,359
and then that actually kind of snakes

11
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,759
along and into this greenhouse it

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,960
stops at various places and this is

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,039
watered with blue mat

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,558
all these mint plants but um

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,160
you know basically that water line comes

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,599
in here

17
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,439
and you know there's a few there's a

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,320
bunch of veggies in here right now

19
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,320
got some raised beds these um

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,800
these raised beds are all controlled

21
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:52,399
they come off of this line here and

22
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,319
there's a blue mat here you see that

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,799
which is connected to a little header so

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,359
this water line comes through here

25
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:03,280
into the blue mat into this header and

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,280
then this is one of our manifold beds so

27
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,599
here's that header line this is

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,840
connected

29
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:13,919
to four pieces of blue soak

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,478
um and

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,799
this is mostly wood chips in here

32
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:22,319
there's a bunch of

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,320
you know some potting soil on top

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,960
but the main thing is the

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,280
there's wood chips in the bottom and

36
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,438
they're heavily inoculated with the

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
stropharia rigosa annulata the garden

38
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:33,839
giant

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,759
so we get a lot of mushroom production

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,759
out of these we probably pulled

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,759
30 to 40 pounds of mushrooms per bed out

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,959
of this last year

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,439
anyways you can still see that water

44
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,679
line coming through

45
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,719
um again these are all on blue mats

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,439
they're slightly buried under some mulch

47
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,879
you can see some tape coming up here but

48
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:57,919
this whole thing is just on autopilot

49
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:01,438
from here this water line continues on

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,640
into kind of the rest of the garden

51
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,279
you know there's just a few things out

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,280
here right now

53
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,840
and the waters are mulberry trees and

54
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,159
the line actually snakes all the way

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,200
around here

56
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,479
and you can see there's that

57
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,238
that line right there that's eight

58
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,359
millimeter line

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,480
um that's connected all these blue mats

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,800
so all these you know tomatoes and

61
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:34,839
mint plants and even all these petunias

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,160
they're all um connected to blue mats as

63
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,200
well

64
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:43,519
um just the hibiscus

65
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:45,039
and we've got

66
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,120
some more production oriented

67
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,359
greenhouses across the

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,840
way over there a couple 30 foot

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,840
greenhouses

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,800
i'm gonna show you also the blue matte

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,360
classics um

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,640
these are cool they're just look like

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,680
this and these are what we use for house

74
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,878
plants but

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,439
basically you just stick this in the

76
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,840
soil and then you put one end of this

77
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,280
tube in a bucket of water and it siphons

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,200
the water out

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,439
so you have

80
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,560
your glue mat in there siphoning water

81
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,400
from this bucket

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,719
that's great for you know smaller plants

83
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,840
or seedlings

84
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:28,959
you know rooting clones things like that

85
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,680
this here's a line

86
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,280
an additional line that comes in this

87
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,640
one has

88
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,239
used this for a nursery production but

89
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,318
i'm coming off this line we have more

90
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,439
blue mats so you know i can

91
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:46,000
individually uh water

92
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,439
you know 5 gallon pots in this case on

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,560
this rod this is one of our

94
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,639
blue matte moisture sensors

95
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,799
what's that reading at 99 perfect it's

96
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:59,119
right just right where you'd want it

97
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:03,280
so yeah this is just part of the

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:07,598
kind of garden space here

99
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,598
at my home in colorado
