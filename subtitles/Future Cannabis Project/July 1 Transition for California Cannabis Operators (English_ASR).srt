1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
but now that we're looking at eight

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:06,330
months into the legalized regulated

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,820
market and I know from the bureau's

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,949
perspective for each part of the supply

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,259
chain we've had our own challenges in

6
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:16,198
regulating so I wanted to get your

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,089
perspective on how it has been for you

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,939
the last eight months and being in this

9
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:23,070
regulated market and especially how have

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,268
you continued to deal with the changes

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,189
that come down because we always talk

12
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:27,778
about the regulator's you know we keep

13
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,528
changing things on you and so I'm

14
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:34,829
curious how you've dealt with that you

15
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:36,420
know you have to stay nimble and you

16
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,890
have to be on top of it I think the

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,230
worst thing you can do is refer to

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,759
lawyers to interpret the regulations for

19
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:43,890
you instead of as a business operator

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,049
being engaged in them in a line-by-line

21
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,700
fashion and I think that's where some

22
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:50,009
people have been caught unawares at

23
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,750
times where they're relying on others to

24
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,219
interpret for them rather than as I say

25
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,378
as operators actually being fully

26
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,939
engaged in the text of the regulations

27
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:59,640
but I think some of the biggest

28
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,320
challenges have been to on the lab side

29
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,689
is the the marketing right of the

30
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,299
regulations is is to help guide people

31
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:07,859
through things they feel are

32
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,240
unreasonable are things they don't feel

33
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,159
like they should have to do and help

34
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,170
explain and understand to them that this

35
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,060
path forward represents one where we're

36
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,890
taking some extraordinary measures

37
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,079
around the protection of consumer safety

38
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,060
because we lack a certain body of data

39
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,879
so I think one of the biggest challenges

40
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,650
has been to communicate to the people

41
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,959
who are the users of lab testing in this

42
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,659
current market maybe why some of the

43
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,639
things that are in place are there in

44
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,540
terms of being able to react to the

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,489
changing regulations mostly you have to

46
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,140
anticipate when you get an initial draft

47
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,000
of regulations you need to take them

48
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,129
almost as if that's what's going to be

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,659
because if you wait until the end of a

50
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:46,920
comment period implementation then

51
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,670
you'll find yourself probably too far

52
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,290
behind

53
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,030
so I think one of the struggles that

54
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,799
people have had is well I don't want to

55
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,180
spend money I don't have to write in

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,549
case this thing changes let's say

57
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,750
there's no heavy metals requirement for

58
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,180
example right I don't want to buy an

59
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,218
icp-ms if I don't have to so I think

60
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,680
making those decisions in anticipation

61
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:07,798
of what could be while trying to manage

62
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,969
cash flow and and and capital is been

63
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,050
challenging as a business owner yeah

64
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:18,900
absolutely all those points

65
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:23,130
the I think probably the top level thing

66
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,750
I would say is the ultimate goal was to

67
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:27,569
transition people from the black market

68
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,580
to the regulated market and for as a

69
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:32,340
whole supply chain Enterprise such as

70
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,690
group of floor it's frustrating talking

71
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,789
for example to dispensary owners

72
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,379
explaining to them that the packaging we

73
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,459
have actually does comply with the law

74
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,099
and then getting into fights with them

75
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,080
about why it does or does not that that

76
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,639
gets very tiresome so there's a lot of

77
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,440
unknown

78
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,089
I was actually mentioning to you Laurie

79
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,819
before the event there's a lot of

80
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,770
distrust politically there's also a lot

81
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,449
of distrust in our industry towards the

82
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,750
politicians and I think that the more we

83
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:59,879
can you know connect and demystify a lot

84
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:04,740
of both ends of that being really useful

85
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:09,479
for us I think the to see a larger

86
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:11,100
rollout I think this has been less you

87
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:12,629
know explosive rollout than we had

88
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,579
anticipated so a lot of people spend a

89
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:18,810
lot of money and a lot of energy to gear

90
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,370
up for not a lot and so that's been very

91
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,900
frustrating and I hope to see that

92
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:26,489
evolve well interesting you mentioned

93
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,920
the packaging relationship with

94
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:32,400
retailers but before I get to that I

95
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:35,429
would say a sort of on an overall 30,000

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,560
foot view of this has been the educating

97
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,560
and talking to both the vendors and the

98
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,000
public because we have both basically to

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,819
deal with and the public has been very

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,800
frustrated with the rising prices and

101
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,069
the taxes and a lot of that sort of the

102
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,230
education around that component and then

103
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,489
also talking to the vendors and and like

104
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:55,469
some of us we're talking about before

105
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,200
everybody sort of has their own

106
00:03:55,469 --> 00:04:01,530
interpretation on what's compliant and

107
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,569
what's not and it kind of comes down to

108
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,979
you know sort of making a determination

109
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:09,629
of within the business of where you know

110
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,819
where you're gonna draw the line and and

111
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,530
what you believe is going to be the

112
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,108
right thing because ultimately I think

113
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,509
if if the intent is there and you're

114
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:21,478
trying your best to be as compliant as

115
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:25,620
you can in your own capacity then you're

116
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,430
doing as well as you can but yeah so

117
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,038
it's sort of just been

118
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,918
balancing act and making sure I think

119
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:40,800
the July first transition was

120
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:44,219
fascinating it was it was yeah you know

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,689
it was it was inevitable and I think

122
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,130
that it were really we're in a really

123
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:49,500
interesting place in California being

124
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:53,300
the largest cannabis market in the world

125
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,709
and you know having just one chief

126
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,949
overseeing the the largest cannabis

127
00:04:55,709 --> 00:05:00,719
market and trying to fit all the supply

128
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,310
chains and together and and having

129
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,220
everybody talk to each other and making

130
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,589
sure that that it's working and that we

131
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,110
all are on the basically the same page

132
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:11,519
so it is a heavy lift but I'm really

133
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,560
glad that it's happening and I think it

134
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,810
if it's done right if people stay

135
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,459
diligent then it can be done oh it's not

136
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,139
entirely impossible but there's always

137
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:20,909
going to be challenges and always going

138
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,439
to be issues and then there's also the

139
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,389
working with the local jurisdiction I

140
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,978
think has also been a challenge and that

141
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:28,470
seemed to bring out a lot of players

142
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:30,288
that had never traditionally come out to

143
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,370
challenge anything regarding cannabis

144
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:35,759
BPG has been around for almost 20 years

145
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,288
and most of the community members seemed

146
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,788
fine with it and then all of a sudden

147
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:42,240
January 1st

148
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:44,310
there was this outpour of interest

149
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,710
groups that were completely opposed and

150
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,389
it was shocking because I nothing really

151
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:51,418
changed other than who we let in the

152
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:54,930
door and tweaking security measures so

153
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:56,819
that was kind of a challenge I agree

154
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:01,379
with much as much that has been said

155
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:02,490
already and you know to not repeat any

156
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,129
of that I would say that it really does

157
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:09,110
feel like we are all you know we've all

158
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:12,329
got our map on how to try to succeed and

159
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,460
were each interpreting those words

160
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:17,279
slightly differently as we make our way

161
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:20,189
through this dark forest because it's

162
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:23,538
not there's no path it's follow the map

163
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:25,800
and that's been the challenge is my

164
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:28,019
impression or my understanding of what

165
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,020
these words say is a little bit

166
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:32,609
different than maybe somebody else's and

167
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:37,259
we've got to do business together and

168
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:39,790
and that creates complexities and at the

169
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,329
same time to make a separate different

170
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:46,510
I think that we're all able to

171
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:50,079
understand and measure the success of

172
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:53,379
this growing regulated market but we're

173
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,899
not able to measure the health and

174
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:58,839
wellness of the illicit market that

175
00:06:55,899 --> 00:07:00,429
we're trying to deconstruct and that

176
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,609
presents a challenge to me because I can

177
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:06,579
only understand whether we're making

178
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,040
progress as a regulated market but not

179
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:12,939
whether or not we are gaining ground on

180
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,189
the illicit market and so I think that's

181
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:17,170
a lot of really good lead into what

182
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:19,469
cultivators are facing especially

183
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,580
existing cultivators right we have a

184
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,700
cultivation system that breaks

185
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:27,399
cultivators in two sizes and scales them

186
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:30,459
right so you're 2,500 square feet or

187
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:33,099
you're below 5,000 or you're below 10 or

188
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:37,209
22 or if you're outdoor you can have up

189
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,980
to an anchor and so California has a 20

190
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:41,949
year old cannabis industry that's trying

191
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:44,800
to wrap regulations around a very robust

192
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:48,819
existing industry this has not been done

193
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,460
before right in most states statute has

194
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:53,980
passed regulations happen in an industry

195
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:57,909
is burst right so here in California we

196
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:59,950
have a whole new paradigm where these

197
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:03,010
regulators are trying to figure out how

198
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:07,899
to fit a multi-billion dollar industry

199
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:11,769
into a linear regulated box so to say so

200
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:14,319
for existing cultivators were were

201
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:17,589
having a lot of struggles we didn't we

202
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,870
didn't build our cultivation based on

203
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:21,639
you know five hundred square foot

204
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,949
increments or 5,000 square foot

205
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:27,479
increments we built them a lot of times

206
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:30,759
where they fit in the landscape and so

207
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:35,759
what we're really struggling with there

208
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:40,029
are these challenges around how to have

209
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:41,950
12,000 square feet when the licenses are

210
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:43,750
ten thousand or twenty two right

211
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,780
economically you don't fit into twenty

212
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,370
two thousand square-foot license and you

213
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:50,649
don't really fit into ten thousand

214
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,810
because you have twelve thousand so a

215
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,559
lot of our members and the existing

216
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:55,569
cultivator

217
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:58,269
especially the seasonal cultivators I

218
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:03,150
find are really struggling with how to

219
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:06,750
fit their existing operations into a

220
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:09,600
regulated model that doesn't have

221
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:13,120
flexibility right it's really linear and

222
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,759
the issues around shared facilities if I

223
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,500
have to have two licenses because I'm

224
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,500
twelve thousand square feet I now can't

225
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:24,759
share a processing or a propagation area

226
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:27,009
so we have lots of providers that have

227
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:29,319
been working diligently to provide

228
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:32,470
medicine for patients over the last 20

229
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:36,010
years that don't necessarily have the

230
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,810
funding to build new facilities nor do

231
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:40,028
they have the space or necessarily the

232
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:43,088
land use opportunities because of being

233
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:45,149
located rural E and they're on a glans

234
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:49,600
and not on commercial lands or

235
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:51,220
industrial lands so you know work we're

236
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,730
kind of constantly trying to figure out

237
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:58,029
how to fit into a system after years and

238
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:02,460
years of engaging and being involved in

239
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:05,049
proposition 215 and SB 420 and feeling

240
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,180
kind of really pulled in a multitude of

241
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:10,359
ways so it's a little bit of a kind of

242
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:12,919
quicksand scenario for a lot of our

243
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:33,360
stakeholders and members

244
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:33,360
