1
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:20,640
we will open it up to the much

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,519
weighted Q&amp;A um so um I'm speaking not

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,839
only for myself but probably other small

4
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,719
businesses who can't get a license

5
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,759
because there's no license available I'm

6
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,839
told that I'm having to wait so I have

7
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:33,039
to

8
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,920
be illegal before they get their act

9
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,759
together there's no hope I mean I don't

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,520
see any hope because they say that um

11
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:43,878
sometime in um in early 2018 I said wait

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,280
I'm I waiting

13
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:48,159
2018 okay and the question well what's

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,600
happening I saying what is happening

15
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,198
with that and where's the fight with

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,439
that and you're saying about small

17
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:57,198
businesses well I'm a small business and

18
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:59,439
is it becoming successful and I mean

19
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,878
where's the Hope in that or not the hope

20
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,359
the reality of it happening soon where's

21
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:06,039
the fight about that battleships don't

22
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:07,438
turn on a dime it's going to take a few

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,560
years to go through the rul making

24
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,639
process proposition 215 was passed 19

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,719
years ago it did not provide for lawful

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,118
commercial activity it took a lot of

27
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:17,560
work to get that legislation passed it's

28
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:19,640
going to take a little bit longer to get

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,118
the nuts and bolts written a law is

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,960
usually about 60 pages and then it turns

31
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:26,680
into four five 600 7,000 pages of

32
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,879
regulations it's going to take a minute

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,320
the initiative is not going to change

34
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:32,118
that the initiative is going to have a

35
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:34,758
timeline too too it's law regulation

36
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:36,399
still takes time and so you know yeah

37
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,640
there's going to be a delay at least

38
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,040
there's light at the end of the tunnel

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,200
now at least there's a tunnel now um it

40
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,759
took 19 years to get here it we don't

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,520
need to do it all at

42
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,239
once buiness how are we fighting for the

43
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,839
small businesses I can get involved with

44
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:52,239
you yeah I mean our sponsored

45
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,399
legislation this year was a cottage

46
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,679
cultivation Bill to create a new license

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,320
type for subsistance Farmers uh we lower

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,000
tax rates segmented Marketplace so that

49
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,000
there is independent opportunity in each

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,599
segment I mean we have a long list of of

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,639
demonstrable commitment to small

52
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,799
business owners um you know it will be

53
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,359
I'd like undermines frankly this is good

54
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,560
you guys twoo can follow I'd like Nathan

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,920
to chime in here just just real quick

56
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,239
what you can do while you're waiting is

57
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,518
get involved you know the local

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,439
governments are where you need to be

59
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,439
right now it is the waiting game and

60
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,239
because a solid ordinance takes about 18

61
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,719
months to work at your local government

62
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,200
and so while you are waiting you are

63
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,598
operating a lot and that's the problem

64
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,238
even the majority of both our members

65
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,639
still Opera in the gray and black market

66
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,519
because they just don't have the options

67
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,958
and so what you need to do is to reach

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,560
out to your local governments now and

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,439
start working with them to help them

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,000
craft these ordinances so when 2018

71
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,598
comes around you have your local

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,239
Improvement to operate and then you can

73
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,560
just jump in and grab your your estate

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,840
license after that and certainly being

75
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,560
here and being part of the conversation

76
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,000
is a big part of that Amanda I just

77
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,519
wanted to point if you don't know Jackie

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,439
McAllan I'm going to call you out Jackie

79
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,719
sitting behind you she has a really

80
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:00,479
great group on Facebook about California

81
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,800
and what's going on locally so I'm just

82
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,840
saying if you want to hook into other

83
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,480
people in your area that may be also

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,959
working on it so you can strategize

85
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,598
together it's just a great way to find

86
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,519
all the updates and she does a great job

87
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:11,518
with it so check that

88
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,719
out okay let's go to the next one hey

89
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,439
guys um my my question is based on a

90
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,080
conversation I've had with each and

91
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:26,079
every one of you for the last year plus

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,840
um assuming this does pass what are the

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,159
actual steps that will be taken for that

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,920
hard work to make sure that the

95
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:39,239
legislators and The Regulators do not

96
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:42,079
screw this up and that only you prevent

97
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,878
only 10% of existing operators from

98
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,280
converting into the new system in the

99
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:48,479
new world long term I would say being

100
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,959
involved now I mean that's key I mean

101
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,479
right now there they are there uh all

102
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,560
the regulatory agencies are having

103
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,798
scoping meetings up and down the state

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,158
talking to the industry you know both of

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,120
our groups have sent out you know

106
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,318
announcements to our own membership to

107
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,719
act to to get them involved to attend

108
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:07,839
those hearings to be engaged with the

109
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:09,519
the with the the The Regulators because

110
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,000
one things that that is different with

111
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,438
what's going on right now you know

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,919
someone is I've been in working on local

113
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:16,439
cannabis policy for about six years and

114
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,319
I've never been in a place before where

115
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,759
I've had Regulators so willing to work

116
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,000
with us where they want to know how how

117
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,439
how we operate they are begging us for

118
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,240
for white papers they are begging us for

119
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,399
data on how because they are come to us

120
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,199
and have been hon us and said we don't

121
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,279
know how this works and and so we have

122
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,240
to be diligent in engaging our local

123
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,879
Regulators consistently uh uh with

124
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,319
credible members so they write the best

125
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,719
rules possible so I'm going to point to

126
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,519
some specific policy steps that we will

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,280
need to take if this is successful first

128
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,639
and foremost California is an export

129
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:50,638
Marketplace we are overproducing we do

130
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,120
not need an unlimited scale type five

131
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,199
license the fact that that is in the

132
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,560
proposition in and of itself shows a a

133
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,520
disconnect from reality we need to be

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,000
constraining and reducing our

135
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,240
productivity if and until export sales

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,519
are available they're not the type five

137
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,720
needs to go secondly we need to restore

138
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,879
Market segmentation we need to protect

139
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,039
against conglomerate ownership that can

140
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,959
dominate entire Supply chains current

141
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:18,918
law provides those protections the

142
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:21,359
proposition removes them um those are

143
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:23,680
specific policy changes that we need to

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,639
make in order to ensure that the

145
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,079
marketplace creates enough opportunity

146
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,000
for licenses thirdly I think the whole

147
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,478
proposition 64 is is skewed a bit larger

148
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,279
than it needs to be the cottage

149
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,599
cultivation bill that we introduced had

150
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:40,758
a cap at 2500 square ft that's Based on

151
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,560
data back for members that's real life

152
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,960
10,000 square fet was the number that

153
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,160
the Growers picked as a small grow not a

154
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,000
cottage grow the whole thing is sort of

155
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,120
pushed bigger we don't have a bigger

156
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,759
Marketplace we'll see some growth but

157
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,199
not the type of growth in the market

158
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,280
that's going to be required to keep

159
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,879
everybody on a path toward being a

160
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,638
business owner not a criminal so we've

161
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,639
got some real work to do

162
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,800
uh well from our perspective we're

163
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:06,959
looking at vulnerabilities around the

164
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,280
social justice right so we need to make

165
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,519
sure that we protect the rights of

166
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,279
people with drug felonies to get

167
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,719
licenses we need to make sure that we

168
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,959
protect some of the other um reductions

169
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,919
we've done in penalties if the

170
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,638
legislature decides that they want to

171
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,038
try to take that away so we need to just

172
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,079
be very clear what what our

173
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:25,680
vulnerabilities are and do D do do do

174
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,758
due diligence that's like the hardest

175
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,199
thing to say ever I don't think I've

176
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,720
ever said that um due diligence um to

177
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,439
make sure that we protect what we work

178
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,880
really hard to put in there um and

179
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,719
that's why we really I mean we're we're

180
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,519
gonna we're in Sacramento now but we're

181
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,080
going to have to be there even more than

182
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,799
we are now um and not just us and the

183
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:44,680
people that work in the policy world but

184
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,800
the people that are now part of a legal

185
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,120
industry right are also going to have to

186
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,639
show up continuously and advocate for

187
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,639
themselves as

188
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,519
well hello good afternoon my name is on

189
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,159
Hernandez and uh from the talk I've

190
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,399
heard that there's a message that there

191
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,360
is no urgency uh that we're over

192
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,560
producing marijuana but in the state of

193
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,240
California there are 4,800 barriers to

194
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,120
people with the criminal record even

195
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,960
people with misdemeanors so even people

196
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,240
getting misdemeanors today can't get

197
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,560
employment um can't do a lot of things

198
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,319
can't get money for education so one

199
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,038
thing uh if you can talk about this

200
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,919
Amanda is the urgency around getting

201
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,038
people that are incarcerated currently

202
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,439
because right now there is a handful of

203
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:27,519
people that are in prison not too big

204
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,519
but thousands of people are currently in

205
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,918
our nla and in our County jails um so

206
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,598
can you speak to the urgency on that

207
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,198
because people's lives are at stake and

208
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,439
every day that goes by that we don't do

209
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,199
something that's another day that

210
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,160
someone has to be in jail in prison and

211
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,079
that's another day that your taxes go to

212
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,199
pay for

213
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,478
that well I think you bring up I mean

214
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,158
you bring up a good point there you know

215
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:48,918
there's obviously the social justice

216
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:52,079
impact but there's a financial impact

217
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:54,560
too it costs a lot of money to jail

218
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,758
people u a lot of money and so you're

219
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,240
right you know it's not that 50% of the

220
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,759
the prison population in California is

221
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,000
in there for marijuana but even if it's

222
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,759
just a small percent that's still

223
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,519
thousands of people because we have a

224
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,158
very big population so um if prop 64

225
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,120
passes the day after it passes people

226
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:13,399
who are in jail for things that are no

227
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,199
longer uh arrestable offenses will be

228
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,839
able to petition to get out people will

229
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,840
be able to petition to get their records

230
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:20,519
reduced and get their sentences reduced

231
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,399
they'll be able to apply to get their

232
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,478
records expunged and there's no time

233
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,679
limit on this so I just want to mention

234
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,680
of those of you that are familiar with

235
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,560
Prop 47 there was a three-year time

236
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
limit for you to do this activity

237
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,240
there's no time limit um and then one

238
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,799
other thing about the expungement that I

239
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,639
think is important that's a Nuance that

240
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,199
I didn't even really recognize you know

241
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:41,000
the importance of until a little while

242
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,640
ago was that the burden is on the state

243
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,600
to prove that what you were doing was

244
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,919
illegal at the time you were doing it

245
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,080
not on you so what this means that if

246
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,958
you were arrested say 10 years ago for

247
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,959
growing 10 plants and that's felony

248
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,399
cultivation right now in California

249
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,559
growing marijuana is a felony then it

250
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,559
says felony cultivation on your record

251
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,479
when you go to get that expunged the

252
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,759
state has to prove that you had more

253
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,920
than six plants at the time of that

254
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,838
arrest you don't have to prove that you

255
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:11,199
had less than six plants and given that

256
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,040
six plants is legal chances are you're

257
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,759
going to get that expunged and you know

258
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,278
something we're seeing in real time

259
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:21,958
right now are that Das are putting their

260
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:23,958
cases off until after November 8th if

261
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,559
what the person's being charged for will

262
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,958
no longer be a crime because they don't

263
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,439
want to take the time and energy of the

264
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,799
courts to process the case so it hasn't

265
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,040
even passed and it's already you know

266
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,120
having an impact in terms of of Criminal

267
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,360
Justice

268
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,959
Reform I just I want to add one more

269
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,919
statistic sorry I just want to add one

270
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,119
more statistic in the state of

271
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,278
California there's about a million

272
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,480
people that have marijuana offenses uh

273
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,639
on the record from previous offenses so

274
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,278
there's people incarcerated but there's

275
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,958
currently people uh that are barred from

276
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:55,519
you know an education employment because

277
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,518
of previous marijuana offenses

278
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,278
so hello my name isgan Humphrey I have a

279
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,560
question for the gentleman in the middle

280
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:07,120
cuz I'm sorry I don't know your name um

281
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,359
but I was just wondering do the people

282
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,720
who are still facing misdemeanor charges

283
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,079
and still facing criminalization do they

284
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,079
not matter or are their needs not as

285
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,919
important because myself as a black

286
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:20,639
woman I don't have a medical marijuana

287
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,679
card I don't have a medical need for

288
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,720
marijuana but I like to use marijuana

289
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:28,679
recreationally and I still risk going to

290
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,160
jail I still risk losing time from work

291
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:34,879
and possibly Los losing my job because I

292
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:37,319
if I get arrested for it so do my people

293
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,278
and my friends do we not matter because

294
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,560
we're not a small business dispensary

295
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,320
and we're just people who want to use

296
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:47,919
recreationally um so so let me explain

297
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,760
who my members are my members 30% of our

298
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,479
board are people of color 40% of our

299
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,319
board have been

300
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,680
arrested we are the very community that

301
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,639
is currently in jail we are the very

302
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,919
community that is currently being being

303
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,560
impacted disproportionately this isn't

304
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:07,639
an us and you we are each other we are

305
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,319
the same Community here the fact of the

306
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,360
matter is we're allowed to have

307
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,160
differences of opinion and perspective

308
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,800
and we're allowed to view the potential

309
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:18,519
outcomes differently of course we matter

310
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,679
of course we do I don't have a r card

311
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,320
either I don't have a medical need I'm

312
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,759
exactly where you I have I've been

313
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,399
arrested I've dealt with this so have a

314
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:29,000
vast majority of my friends and family

315
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,000
believe it or not this isn't something

316
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,600
that breaks cleanly along race lines

317
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,600
it's not something that breaks cleanly

318
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,000
along any of these lines proposition 64

319
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,159
has a lot in it that is not what Amanda

320
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
is describing big up to DPA they did a

321
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,719
great job on the social justice issues

322
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,919
and the criminal justice issues the

323
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,519
unfortunate reality is that the economic

324
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:52,559
Justice component was overlooked Justice

325
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,720
is a whole concept in my opinion it's

326
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,958
indivisible yes of course you matter yes

327
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,160
of course we matter there's a lot in

328
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,078
this thing and we can have a

329
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,159
conversation about how to clean it up

330
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:08,199
afterwards if it passes and how to make

331
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,199
sure that we achieve these goals if it

332
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:15,320
doesn't I just wanted to clarify that

333
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:17,720
when I speak about me being it's not

334
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,000
because not only because I'm a black

335
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,600
woman but also because I'm not in the

336
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,799
industry I have no stake in the economic

337
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,879
impact of it I don't plan to ever be in

338
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,359
the industry but I do want to have my

339
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,399
freedom because regardless of whether I

340
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,600
use or not so does this do the small

341
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,519
business owners not matter should the

342
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,120
should the 20,000 small business owners

343
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,399
who won't be licensed never and I never

344
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,720
said that consumers didn't matter said

345
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,720
it wasn't as

346
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,039
okay so uh my question really actually

347
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,319
it kind of relates to more or less the

348
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:54,039
the way that I view this and I'm still

349
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,079
very kind of neutral on my position with

350
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,039
uh the initiative on on a lot of

351
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,958
different fundamental levels but I feel

352
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,719
like we're in such a time of unknowns in

353
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:05,000
California and as somebody have been

354
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,680
operating every single day um in a world

355
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,240
that's really evolved a lot and we're

356
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,078
still at a point where we're waiting on

357
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,839
a thousand pages of regulations from the

358
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:15,198
Bureau of cannabis that we do not know

359
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,360
um I don't know whether I'm going to

360
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:19,039
support or they they could be very

361
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,199
overreaching in a way that we really

362
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,159
need to make a change and it's almost

363
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:26,198
like if we're on a boat and we're we've

364
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,000
got one rescue boat to like get off to

365
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:29,759
get to the island and we're we're just

366
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,399
selling it out before we we know if we

367
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,639
have the gas to get to the island um and

368
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,958
and we're not that the initiative

369
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,440
process being that rescue boat if these

370
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:41,239
you know thousand Pages because Mera was

371
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,160
not perfect and there is uh language

372
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,440
within the current law that looks to be

373
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:47,000
like it could be overreaching and

374
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,760
overreaching on a level that's never

375
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,360
been put to any other industry on the

376
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:54,000
planet Earth um and we really need to

377
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,159
use the People's Law um for its

378
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
intentions and make sure to preserve

379
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,159
that point because if we do get to that

380
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
position um it's going to be real

381
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,480
difficult to recreate that rescue boat

382
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,360
with you know everybody that would buy

383
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,519
in and would create the campaign and the

384
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,720
funding already bought in to 64 so what

385
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,959
what is the option if uh if that is our

386
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,000
scenario yes we we we could have

387
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:21,319
probably let this play out and seen what

388
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,519
things looked like before using this

389
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,519
tool this is a very difficult tool to

390
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,240
recreate once it's used and you know

391
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,440
what's passed in the legislature is

392
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,799
subject to judicial review it can still

393
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,120
be dealt with in the courts we can still

394
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:41,000
challenge the basic 215 rights arguably

395
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,440
rights that that were granted um you

396
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,799
know that it's certainly I think fair to

397
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:50,120
say that yes on adult use everyone here

398
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:52,359
is yes on adult use timing and specifics

399
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,919
matter um well I just want to add you

400
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,639
know I think one of the things that

401
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,679
we're really going to get to help us

402
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,278
make sure that we do create the image we

403
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,399
want to see is that once once we're

404
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,639
legal we were just talking about this

405
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,759
during lunch is that we're going to have

406
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,120
allies that we've never had before right

407
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:09,360
so we're going to have the anti-gmo

408
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,440
people and the fair trade people and the

409
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,560
small business people and the herbal

410
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,600
medicine people and the folks that have

411
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,198
been circling around us with a lot of

412
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,959
interest for a while but a lot haven't

413
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:22,198
taken the plunge because we were still

414
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:24,679
doing something that was illegal and so

415
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:27,078
I think the ability to go and Lobby you

416
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,638
know someone that that works to preserve

417
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:31,318
um Heirloom Seeds for tomato

418
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,120
and say Hey you know we want to do the

419
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:34,639
same for cannabis and now it's legal

420
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,240
here that they're going to be like okay

421
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,839
yeah we'll work with you and we're

422
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,799
already seeing that with criminal

423
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,399
justice organizations that do re-entry

424
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:43,879
work like planning Justice that helps um

425
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,919
folks who are getting out of San Quenton

426
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:48,198
get jobs in urban farming like they're

427
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,719
like yes let's work with cannabis like

428
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:51,758
let's make cannabis part of what we're

429
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,040
doing so we're going to gain allies

430
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,399
we're not going to have to work in so

431
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,559
much isolation anymore and I think that

432
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,000
that's really going to open up

433
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,758
opportunities for Innovation and for

434
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,159
creating this this this image because

435
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,440
there's a lot of folks out there that

436
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,719
care about this stuff as it relates to

437
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,079
other products and we haven't been able

438
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,879
to fully engaged with them

439
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:15,919
yet so um I understand the criminal

440
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,519
justice um components of Alma so my but

441
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,120
my question is really more industry

442
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,839
related I hear not enough about the

443
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,879
progress that the medical cannabis

444
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:27,839
regulation safety act made we um and

445
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:30,838
it's almost like it kind of goes on the

446
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,199
Wayside so can we talk about not not

447
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,240
pitting them one against the other I

448
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:39,159
think they're both progress what is the

449
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,480
main difference in terms of um how it

450
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:44,278
affects industry small business and what

451
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:48,360
is your vision for your ideal vision for

452
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:50,318
the industry related to that um this is

453
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,000
this is sort of at the core of our issue

454
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:53,879
full disclosure Lauren is one of our

455
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,519
board members so she's been party to

456
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:59,240
this conversation for many months um

457
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,959
there are a few key distinctions between

458
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,399
current state law to regulate the

459
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,480
medical cannabis industry and the

460
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,759
industry regulations that are proposed

461
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,838
I'd like to preface my quick synopsis of

462
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:11,720
them by saying nobody here is arguing

463
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:15,000
with the social and criminal justice

464
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,759
pieces take a minute to ask why the

465
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,558
differences that I'm about to point out

466
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:21,558
exist and what the outcomes of them will

467
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:23,720
be first and foremost the current state

468
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:26,279
law for medical production is limited

469
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,519
cultivation is limited at one acre per

470
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,879
license The Regulators are working on

471
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:33,119
what the overall cap on cultivation will

472
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,320
be there's a finite Marketplace here

473
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:38,279
there is a finite number of Acres that

474
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:40,798
will produce every gram that we need the

475
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:43,038
proposition opens The Floodgate to much

476
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,960
larger Consolidated Enterprise if we are

477
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,759
talking about Industrial Hemp if we are

478
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,000
talking about export markets if we are

479
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,839
talking about a a Marketplace that we

480
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,400
don't have sure we're going to have a

481
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:54,519
different conversation but right now we

482
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,200
have to deal with an instate market and

483
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:59,079
those business owners those people that

484
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,038
are going to jail the three text

485
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:03,519
messages I've got today of folks that

486
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,599
are in handcuffs right now it's not

487
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,079
necessarily going to change for them

488
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,678
because there may not be room to

489
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:11,558
participate in the regulated Marketplace

490
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,519
secondly the market segmentation

491
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,119
currently you have to sort of choose one

492
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,158
Silo out of five within the marketplace

493
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:20,519
that's disruptive to a lot of current

494
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,360
businesses but it does ensure that there

495
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,400
are more licensed opportunities for more

496
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,319
individual businesses again those are

497
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,600
more humans that won't be criminals

498
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,279
anymore it's a very human issue the

499
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:34,199
social and criminal justice stuff again

500
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,079
I I great that's awesome let's do that

501
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,880
but why do the industry Rags look

502
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,079
different and and I think that you've

503
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,280
hit the nail spot on the head there were

504
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,960
business owners that were not satisfied

505
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:45,720
who felt like they had lost in the

506
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,079
legislature and this initiative is

507
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,919
unfortunately in part being used as a

508
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,399
tool to repeal those

509
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,840
protections U you want to go first yeah

510
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,960
I just wanted to say that the licenses

511
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:00,839
available in prop 64 don't replace the

512
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,558
licenses available in mcrsa so you mcrsa

513
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,319
sets out a licensing structure if you're

514
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,158
not licensed under mcrsa you're illegal

515
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:10,319
um right now the penalty for growing in

516
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:12,600
California is a felony um if prop 64

517
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,279
passes it becomes a misdemeanor and a

518
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:16,719
whole new set of licenses are available

519
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:20,918
in addition to the licenses given under

520
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:24,279
mcrsa now prop 64 was actually conceived

521
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:26,759
before mcrsa was even passed um and so

522
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,599
we sat on it to wait until the last

523
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:30,839
minute so that we could model as many of

524
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:33,480
the licens categories after mcrsa with

525
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,480
the same uh regulating bodies in order

526
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,240
to make it as seamless as possible with

527
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,839
of course adding the micro bus license

528
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,679
at the bottom which is under 10,000

529
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,678
square ft vertical integration under one

530
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,480
license and the tier five which comes

531
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:47,120
online potentially in 2023 if it's

532
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,919
determined that at that time we need

533
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,239
more cannabis produced in the state of

534
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,120
California um I would say that another

535
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,120
difference is the absence of the

536
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,798
mandatory distributor that is uh in Pro

537
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:01,038
um mcrsa but is not in prop 64 now you

538
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:03,480
may call that being able to more easily

539
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:05,038
vertically integrate um it is definitely

540
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,240
a difference from how we regulate

541
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,679
alcohol um but it does allow people to

542
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,120
be their own distributor um and so I

543
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,280
would say that that that's also a

544
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,439
difference um but we do have the ability

545
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,038
to add license types so for example if

546
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,798
Cottage cultivation passes and that

547
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,720
becomes a license type we would love to

548
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,918
see that added to prop 64 licenses in

549
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,000
fact in at in the city of Oakland we

550
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,559
have that as a riter that if that gets

551
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,440
passed we want to see that added into

552
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:31,440
what the city of Oakland is doing

553
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,200
um so absolutely you know I think that

554
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,640
they were meant to be companions to each

555
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,360
other but really to open it up to people

556
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,960
to have more options in terms of the

557
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:43,359
type of businesses that they want to

558
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,200
have go ahead Nate yeah um I have a few

559
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:49,038
a few a few thoughts on perfect um the

560
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,080
first of all reality is the concept of

561
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,240
um you know we just passed this last

562
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:55,599
year shouldn't we let this play out

563
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,120
first is sort of a false argument

564
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,719
because the reality is is the only

565
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,239
reason we got Medical RS passed last

566
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,400
year was cuz they knew the initiative

567
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,000
was coming and the state wanted a chance

568
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,360
to have to actually have a saying how

569
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,079
that would look I mean I remember in the

570
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:11,158
governor's office when they were pushing

571
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,000
back on me and saying they were going to

572
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:14,760
veto the bill they were going to veto

573
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,679
the whole bill the staff was recomending

574
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,240
a veto and they're like why we're going

575
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:19,759
to have an initiative that last year and

576
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,880
I looked at the governor's chief deputy

577
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,119
and I said do you want an option in how

578
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,320
that initiative looks are you just going

579
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,319
to allow the are you going to

580
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:30,359
allow

581
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,558
the um the initiative drafters to draft

582
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,918
their own bill and make it look how they

583
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:34,960
like or does the state want to have a

584
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,679
say in it and so that's why we got in

585
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,440
the that was one of the big reasons why

586
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:40,360
the governor signed it last year and why

587
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,480
we got so many votes to pass it because

588
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:45,599
they knew the initiative was was coming

589
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,720
in the first place um the other reality

590
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:51,000
is is the Protections in that bill

591
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,360
weren't really protections I mean small

592
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,359
the local

593
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:56,558
governments um didn't want to allow

594
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,319
vertical integration not because they

595
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:59,759
were cared about small businesses but

596
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,519
because didn't want the industry to have

597
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,960
any sort of influence and they told that

598
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,400
to us to our face we don't want you guys

599
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,120
to have any sort of influence in

600
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,720
Government we don't want you to be I had

601
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,918
the the California police Chiefs

602
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,960
lobbyist look at me and say we don't

603
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,120
want you to become as big as strong as

604
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,798
the tribes are we want to keep you small

605
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:19,199
so we can keep

606
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:21,000
you controlled and so we did fight to

607
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,600
get those things taken out we also did

608
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,359
fight to have mandatory distribution

609
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:26,759
which was a corporate interest pushed

610
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,678
into it at $20,000 a month in lobbying

611
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:30,319
that's reality we fought to get that

612
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,159
taken out cuz we thought that small

613
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,558
farmers should have the ability to go

614
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,640
direct to Market if they wanted to they

615
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:36,480
shouldn't be forced to use a

616
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,400
Distribution Company we luckily got

617
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,360
amendments added in which allowed small

618
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,440
farmers to have their own contracts they

619
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,278
still have to use part of the

620
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,120
distribution for something but most of

621
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,319
our small businesses don't support that

622
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:47,359
concept and they want to be able to go

623
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,399
direct to Market if they have that

624
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,719
option the reason we supported it was

625
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,720
because the mandate to use a

626
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,000
Distribution Company was taken out and

627
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,319
that's why we support it in the first

628
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,558
place I'm going to hold my nose and vote

629
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:02,558
for this um even though I think that you

630
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:03,960
know there's so much onerous in and

631
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,519
there's so many things that go on

632
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,000
between the uh the testing and the

633
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:10,319
transportation and uh all the other

634
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,319
people that are involved are getting

635
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,599
their fingers in their pie that that

636
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,879
there's going to it's going to keep a

637
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,719
black market alive so you know how are

638
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,240
you going to deal with that because you

639
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,519
know we want to get rid of the cartels

640
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,759
we want to get rid of the murdering in

641
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:25,240
the world we want to we want to set this

642
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:27,158
this as a precipice when we have come to

643
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,759
the top and we're downhill and going all

644
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:33,320
the way but it it it's so honorous you

645
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:35,759
know it's not like alcohol you know and

646
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:38,038
and and it should be closer to alcohol

647
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,960
because alcohol is so much more deadly

648
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:43,519
you know I mean it's just it just

649
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,558
doesn't make sense for me um the other

650
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,158
thing is the um um the fact that it's

651
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,639
it's it seems like it's throwing medical

652
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,520
cannabis under the bus and and to me

653
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,880
that is the most important thing and and

654
00:23:53,519 --> 00:24:01,000
and I don't understand why we don't keep

655
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,600
prop 25 in in place while doing this you

656
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,400
know I I'll I'll answer that um so first

657
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,959
of all I want to I want to um explain

658
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,720
about prop 215 so prop 215 basically

659
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,400
says if you get caught with marijuana

660
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,919
and taken to court you can use your

661
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,679
doctor's note as an excuse that's prop

662
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,559
2115 that's the only right it gives it

663
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,600
doesn't give the right to have

664
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:19,519
dispensaries it doesn't give the right

665
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:23,599
to have an industry it just gives you an

666
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:26,000
immunity defense in court right prop 215

667
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:29,038
is preserving that right is part of the

668
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,119
intents and purposes of prop 64 meaning

669
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:33,879
that if everything else Falls to shit

670
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:36,599
patients will still have the right to

671
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,360
use that excuse in court if they have a

672
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:40,639
doctor's recommendation and that will

673
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:44,119
not change and that is what prop 215

674
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,080
says now um as was mentioned before prop

675
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:49,479
64 is designed to create a market for

676
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:51,879
non-medical adult use meaning

677
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,960
individuals that like to use cannabis

678
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,480
and are adults but are not medical

679
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,319
patients and we don't think those people

680
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,679
should go to jail we think that they

681
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:02,519
should have access to safe product we

682
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,519
think they should have places to use

683
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:06,639
those products and we think that that

684
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:10,119
entails ensuring that they have an

685
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,520
industry to serve them now I will 110%

686
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:15,639
admit like I did before that we are way

687
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,519
over regulating cannabis as compared to

688
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,240
other products because of the fear

689
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,639
around cannabis that we will see

690
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,399
dissipate once the public gets more used

691
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,520
to having it in society right so we'll

692
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:30,319
defin we're definitely going to see that

693
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,319
um so I think yeah

694
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,278
yeah patient right okay right well

695
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:37,918
patients still have their rights I mean

696
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:39,640
if you if you need to have more than an

697
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,320
ounce on you and your person you can

698
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,159
still be a patient you can still have

699
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:45,240
the same condition you had last year you

700
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:48,039
can still go to the same doctor none of

701
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,159
that's changed by either prop 64 or

702
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:52,079
mcrsa um you know if you're somebody

703
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,520
that needs to grow more than six plants

704
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,398
you can be a patient and if your

705
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,398
locality allows for that you can still

706
00:25:55,398 --> 00:26:00,918
do that um we really trying to open up

707
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:03,000
access for individuals um so there

708
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,278
really there's nothing in prop 64 that's

709
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,079
going to negatively impact patients it's

710
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,960
going to give them more options and

711
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:12,519
there's nothing that prevents adult use

712
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,120
stores from charging patients 5 cents

713
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:17,359
for a gram of weed I mean that's that's

714
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,798
completely legal so as we these charity

715
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,719
programs are going to have a chance to

716
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,639
evolve they're going to have a chance to

717
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,120
even be more philanthropic and Community

718
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,159
Based and their options are going to

719
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,839
increase um and so that's really what

720
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,640
we're trying to do while still

721
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,398
preserving the medical program as much

722
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,880
as we can but mcrsa is going to go ahead

723
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:36,599
and change that anyway um oh and then

724
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,278
the last thing I'll say is this is also

725
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,000
California we over-regulate everything

726
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,960
even things we think are completely safe

727
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,119
and benign and wonderful we have way too

728
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,360
many regulations on so I mean that's

729
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,239
going to think about when you're getting

730
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:49,439
into business in California whether

731
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,558
you're going to be in a cannabis

732
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,159
business or whether you're going to be

733
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,000
in a solar business or whether you're

734
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,360
going to be in a cookie business you're

735
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,599
going to have to go through more

736
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,479
regulations and Hoops in this state than

737
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,038
any probably any other state in this

738
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,880
country and so again you know that's the

739
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:05,200
nature of doing business in California

740
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,520
and that's the nature of doing business

741
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,840
with a product where there's a lot of

742
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:10,519
stigma um we won't probably change the

743
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:12,000
overregulation thing but hopefully we'll

744
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:14,879
change the stigma

745
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
thing yeah I just want to follow up that

746
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,039
between uh U Mera or what what are you

747
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,119
calling and

748
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:26,398
yeah thank you um it just seems like

749
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:28,398
it's a a handing off the ball to the

750
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:30,359
Pharmaceuticals um because of the

751
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:33,479
restraints on this it just seems like

752
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:36,359
you know it just I don't know do you

753
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,399
have any comments about that um well I

754
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,959
mean a lot of things seem a certain way

755
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:43,239
and a lot of us have feelings about

756
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,640
things because we don't like big Pharma

757
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,839
and we don't like big alcohol and we

758
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,440
don't like big tobacco we have values

759
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:51,599
right and we see that as mass production

760
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,240
we see it as making things generic we

761
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:54,759
see it as giving jobs to the wrong

762
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,200
people putting things in the wrong

763
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:58,960
places this is a value that we have as

764
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,919
the Cannabis community

765
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,640
and so I'm trusting that because you're

766
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:05,519
up here asking this very question that

767
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,200
when it comes to deciding what we want

768
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,720
the landscape to look like and what

769
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,440
we're going to advocate for and the

770
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,240
policies we're going to advocate for the

771
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,640
businesses that we're going to support

772
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,000
where are we going to put our cannabis

773
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,440
buying money is going to be driven by

774
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,278
our culture and if we as a culture

775
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,038
reject the idea that we want something

776
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:23,880
that's mass-produced and stamped and

777
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:25,798
shipped out to Market by somebody that's

778
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,399
getting no wage and is undocumented and

779
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:31,038
getting taken advantage of we we won't

780
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:32,798
buy those things right we have control

781
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:33,839
over this you know and I I I want to go

782
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,079
back really quick to something Steve

783
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,839
D'Angelo said during his opening keynote

784
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,199
you know which is that we let see if I

785
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:42,319
can get this right we need to cannabiz

786
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,759
corporations more than corpor we

787
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,879
corporatize cannabis so the two things

788
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:49,240
are going to be together because we live

789
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,320
in America but we have an opportunity to

790
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,679
change the way we do corporations by who

791
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:56,240
we are as a cannabis culture rather than

792
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:59,519
letting corporations take us over and

793
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,720
turn us into people we know we aren't

794
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:04,000
I

795
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,278
hope um I'll just say we absolutely do

796
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,839
and those Provisions are in current

797
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:11,599
state law um I just want to quickly

798
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,398
speak to the fact that mandatory

799
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:16,199
distribution is a protection for small

800
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,158
businesses I need to clear the record up

801
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,159
on this because the misinformation is

802
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:24,480
pervasive without a control point in the

803
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:28,679
supply chain audits are too inefficient

804
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,880
for Regulators to complete the 20 the 14

805
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,880
proposal that we opposed that the

806
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,278
industry Association supported had

807
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,278
language that said there will be a limit

808
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,398
on the number of licenses issued

809
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:42,000
consistent with so many other states

810
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:45,000
that have brought regulatory Frameworks

811
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,880
online in the last few years in order to

812
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,240
get to the point where we started with

813
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,679
an unlimited number of licenses that

814
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,839
would be Whitted down over time it was

815
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,399
necessary to impose a control point in

816
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:59,759
the supply chain do we love it of course

817
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:02,839
not but it's better than an arbitrary

818
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,960
limit on the number of licenses starting

819
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:07,918
with a small number and trying to expand

820
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,960
it over time great I would love to bring

821
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,840
cannabis culture to the corporate world

822
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,600
I would love if we had a small business

823
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:16,959
global economy it's not going to happen

824
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:19,599
if we start with a finite number of

825
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,240
licenses because those will be owned

826
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:24,599
consumed regulatory capture will take

827
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,159
place and it will be just like any other

828
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:28,678
Marketplace that we're dealing with

829
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,799
where small businesses can't break in

830
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,840
like it or not it was a small business

831
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,918
protection because it allowed us to move

832
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,240
the needle to an unlimited license

833
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:39,320
starting point okay Nate I want you to

834
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,359
go ahead and chime in on this yeah um I

835
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:43,960
just I gotta be honest it's

836
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,398
just it's it's um it's it's not an

837
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,919
accurate betrayal of what happened and

838
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,359
you know that that language was taken

839
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:51,679
out at your request and you still stayed

840
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:54,079
opposed to the bill you said you would

841
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,798
support it that language was taken out

842
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,558
you still stayed opposed to it we never

843
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:00,000
saw the language in

844
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,278
it

845
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,119
removed I can show you the last public

846
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,638
version of the bill the author of that

847
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,359
bill she's right there she's also my

848
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:11,918
lobbyist now I'm sure she would have

849
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,079
some opinions on that the reality is

850
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,038
those caps are put on there originally

851
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:17,839
that that language was put in for caps

852
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:19,200
we were working on that bill before that

853
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,079
was put on because a farmer at a

854
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,960
stakeholder at a meeting bragged next to

855
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,278
the California narcotics officers

856
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,120
lobbyist there's 30,000 farmers in the

857
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:30,119
Emerald Triangle alone he had had a

858
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,599
heart attack and shifted language the

859
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:33,518
next day trying to say there would be

860
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,079
there could be some sort of cap no hard

861
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,519
numbers we we were opposed to that we're

862
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,158
work to to get it taken out the bill

863
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,240
died before the final version of that

864
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,559
language could be put in and that's the

865
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,558
reality okay so clearly there's a bunch

866
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,558
of history behind this and that's

867
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:54,080
why was foror of this back in the green

868
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,038
room when I was still trying to figure

869
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:59,000
out what an ounce

870
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:00,558
was guys the passate all right let's I

871
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,359
think it's best just to move on to the

872
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:05,918
next question I know a lot of people in

873
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:08,158
jail for marijuana not necessarily the

874
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,960
use of it though not adult use and I'm

875
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,639
wondering how many people for example in

876
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,120
2016 are actually going to jail for

877
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:16,879
using it because when I talk about this

878
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,119
issue with my friends that's what comes

879
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,639
up who's actually going to jail right

880
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:24,479
now for smoking a joint because I see

881
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:26,398
people smoking that all over the place

882
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,679
right depending on where you live and

883
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:31,719
who you are your risk about getting in

884
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:33,360
trouble for casual use very greatly um

885
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,278
now I think one of the biggest risks in

886
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,839
terms of just use because use you know

887
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:39,679
is primarily a ticket in most cases is

888
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,398
the ability of police to approach and

889
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,720
search you and ask for your ID and run

890
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,479
that ID so if you're two people sitting

891
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,480
there smoking a joint one has a warrant

892
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,200
and one doesn't and the odor of

893
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,319
marijuana makes the cop approach and

894
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,558
asks for ID and runs the ID the person

895
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:55,319
with the warrant is going to be picked

896
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:56,720
up for that so again it may not be

897
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:58,319
marijuana possession they're getting

898
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,519
picked up for but the marijuana

899
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:01,720
possession in use was a catalyst for

900
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,759
that involvement with the criminal

901
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,240
justice system and then the second thing

902
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:06,839
I'll say about that is the difference

903
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,079
between possession with a possession

904
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:11,398
with intent to sell because this is also

905
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:13,439
important so when a cop picks somebody

906
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:15,798
up and they have marijuana on them it's

907
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,759
up to the cop to decide if they were

908
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:19,119
just possessing that marijuana or if

909
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,398
they were going to go do something else

910
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,278
with that marijuana afterwards that's

911
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:24,918
completely subjective and so as you can

912
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:26,720
imagine a lot of the times the things

913
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,759
cops will use to say it was possession

914
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,240
with intent to sell or you are you have

915
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:34,359
two different strains on you or you have

916
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,359
an empty baggie or you have a bunch of

917
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:39,798
cash on you now if this was handed out

918
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,759
equally among racial lines then we might

919
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:43,960
say well this is just a flaw on the law

920
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,759
it should be more sub more objective but

921
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,880
the fact is is that blacks are five

922
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,879
times more likely to get that felony

923
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,960
which is what possession with intent is

924
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,679
no matter how much you have even a two

925
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,360
Gams possession with intent is a felony

926
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:59,080
and just possession with which is a

927
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:01,359
ticket so two people with the same

928
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:04,079
behavior both with quantities that would

929
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:05,759
be legal under prop 64 if they're adults

930
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,440
one would get a ticket and one would get

931
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,519
a felony and so we talk about possession

932
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,159
not necess and use not necessarily being

933
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:14,679
the risk it's what happens once someone

934
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,039
comes and stops you and starts

935
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,358
investigating you for that use that ends

936
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,599
up ending up in an arrest or something

937
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,799
more serious than a ticket so it it's

938
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,639
kind of that Catalyst that entry point

939
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,919
for

940
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:30,480
police So currently that's what I

941
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:33,239
thought people do just get a ticket if

942
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,679
they're caught with nothing else so if

943
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,199
you're caught and you just you get

944
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,280
charged with possession so let's say the

945
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,398
cop decides that you know you weren't

946
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,320
trying to sell what you had um so you

947
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:44,759
get a ticket um that's probably the

948
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,519
least that happens to you now if you

949
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,919
can't pay that ticket then you could get

950
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:50,519
a warrant right um so something else may

951
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:52,918
happen to you but what we're saying is

952
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:54,878
that for other people it's usually not

953
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,159
as simple as just getting a ticket for

954
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,239
other folks it's usually a more invasive

955
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:01,000
process

956
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:03,078
that includes running IDs sometimes

957
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,800
being detained um you know being

958
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:07,280
searched anything else that's in your

959
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,560
pockets is being counted against you so

960
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,800
it's really about taking marijuana away

961
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:14,799
as a tool for cops to go after people

962
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,560
for other things to stop a group of

963
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,320
young men of color and ask them what

964
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,880
they're doing empty your pocket show me

965
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,559
your ID um that tool is what we're

966
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,240
trying to take away and as Nate

967
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,320
mentioned the cops aren't very happy

968
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,118
about that and I think that you know we

969
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,838
talk about economics being reason for

970
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:31,760
law enforcement opposition but I think

971
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:34,000
this is it I think it's because they

972
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,160
love that tool and it's really easy to

973
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,559
just go around a vulnerable Community

974
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,679
smell weed and just point to people and

975
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,239
ask them to give you their license and

976
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:43,399
so you know they don't want to get away

977
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,799
that tool because you approach a

978
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,119
cannabis consumer they're docile they're

979
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,800
unlikely to be armed they're unlikely to

980
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:53,519
fight back and so they're using that

981
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,960
against us in order to go after certain

982
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:59,559
communities and so that's where the

983
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:04,039
trouble in what we currently have still

984
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:05,920
exists so the simple answer is zero zero

985
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:08,800
people are currently incarcerated for

986
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,039
possession or use in the state um that

987
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,960
that was released very recently that

988
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:17,159
that's the answer the systemic racism in

989
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:20,599
our society isn't going anywhere public

990
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:24,199
consumption is still a ticket to harass

991
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:26,480
it it's still not going to change and so

992
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:28,559
if if I if we were convinced that this

993
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,760
would address those issues ises

994
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,440
absolutely um I mean I don't want to put

995
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,720
Nina on the spot nah is one of our

996
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,960
members who speaks very passionately

997
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:38,959
about how the specific Provisions in

998
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,880
this initiative are not actually going

999
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,440
to deal with these systemic races racial

1000
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,079
disparities it just isn't going to

1001
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,039
change that underlying situation

1002
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,359
especially for folks that are still

1003
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,079
possessing with intent again that

1004
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:55,279
community of small business owners that

1005
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:56,880
is so much at the Crux of this issue

1006
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,240
because of the liberalization of

1007
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,440
policies that we have seen we are we

1008
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:03,318
really need to deal with with reality

1009
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,599
with the actual people that are in jail

1010
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:08,039
cells not with a a a common

1011
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,200
understanding that unfortunately doesn't

1012
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:11,880
mesh with

1013
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,399
reality just just real quick one of the

1014
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,559
I mean when I went to the academy still

1015
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,680
happens to this day they actually

1016
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,679
trained you on how to arrest people for

1017
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:21,358
possession for sale when they only had a

1018
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,799
joint on them I was trained by the

1019
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:25,159
narcotics Sergeant at Sacramento County

1020
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,640
what you do is you take the weed over

1021
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,159
here you find the extra cash in their

1022
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,199
pocket here see if you could find

1023
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,480
baggies over here and that that training

1024
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:33,118
goes on to this day it's not like it

1025
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,920
ended in 2002 when I went to the academy

1026
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,680
and so that's why you don't see a lot of

1027
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,358
arrests and the for possession because

1028
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:39,759
they train officers on how to actually

1029
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:41,920
get them on

1030
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,119
felonies oh

1031
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,639
interesting sounds like we need to train

1032
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:48,480
our law enforcement better well I just

1033
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,199
also want to say that no one has ever

1034
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,639
claimed that legalizing marijuana is

1035
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:54,279
going to stop the police from being

1036
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:56,239
racist legalizing marijuana is not going

1037
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,040
to stop the police from being racist a

1038
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,239
deep dive into look at the culture of

1039
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:01,679
policing and sanctions against racially

1040
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,000
biased policing is what's going to make

1041
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,559
our police not be racist but this is

1042
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,880
another block between them and people of

1043
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:11,440
color and it's not perfect but it's

1044
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,640
there and right today it's not there

1045
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,519
it's not there right now and prohibition

1046
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:18,118
is real and it's what is the status quo

1047
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:19,639
so we're not talking about a future

1048
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,838
where we get to you know have a world

1049
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:22,239
where no one's getting in trouble and

1050
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:23,639
then maybe we Legalize It and create

1051
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,479
this industry we have a world right now

1052
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:26,719
where people are getting in trouble and

1053
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,199
I know there's a lot of folks in this

1054
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,919
audience who are activists that are

1055
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:31,838
constantly in contact with people who

1056
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,639
are in jail right now for marijuana and

1057
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:34,759
they want to know how come these people

1058
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,838
are building this industry and

1059
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,359
everyone's talking about this and I'm

1060
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,159
sitting in jail I mean they want to know

1061
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:42,039
that and what are we going to tell them

1062
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:43,480
that we need to wait that it's it's not

1063
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:44,800
people aren't really getting in trouble

1064
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,639
so we're going to wait a couple more

1065
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,960
years I I just don't think that's fair

1066
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:50,960
and you know you can say what you want

1067
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,000
about what this will or will not do but

1068
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,720
the fact is that if it lets one person

1069
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,880
out of jail and to return to their

1070
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,358
families you know I'm sorry but that's

1071
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,920
worth it because the criminal justice

1072
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:02,119
system is no freaking joke and I know

1073
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,119
people who have been in jail for

1074
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:06,720
marijuana in a cell with people who have

1075
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:08,079
killed other people and that's not right

1076
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,679
it's not right to put people in our

1077
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,280
community in jail with people who are

1078
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:14,719
violent um and we need to stop it that's

1079
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,480
it we just need to stop I just want to

1080
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,159
say it like um I I've I've been

1081
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,000
listening to this conversation for a

1082
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:23,399
while and uh the one the reoccurring

1083
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,079
themes that I see are it's it seems to

1084
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,519
be an excuse to push what is

1085
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,359
fundamentally agreed upon by all of you

1086
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:34,559
as being a bill that is imperfect in the

1087
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:36,039
name of a a social justice uh name of

1088
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,480
social justice and I've seen

1089
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:40,599
misrepresentation of law as far as like

1090
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,159
well what if I'm just a a smalltime user

1091
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:45,720
and I go to jail because of that and we

1092
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:47,838
all know really really come on you don't

1093
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:51,000
go to jail for small level possession

1094
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:53,239
you don't so I guess my question my

1095
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,079
concern is I was just at a um actually

1096
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:58,799
convention and I saw what was happening

1097
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,839
in the pharmaceutical Lobby there where

1098
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,440
we've seen the EpiPen pushed up uh as

1099
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:06,920
far as cost many many many times which

1100
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,559
is a necessary medicine for many people

1101
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,639
and we've seen uh not only that but

1102
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,318
diabetes medicine and actually the

1103
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,799
pharmaceutical Executives were actually

1104
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:16,079
complaining across the table all of the

1105
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,280
different medicines that were being

1106
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,839
available and these are the already

1107
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,599
legal medicines that are on the table

1108
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,318
are actually being priced out of the

1109
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,480
market by huge amounts of money that are

1110
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:28,000
coming into this industry and buying it

1111
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,838
and I'm saying if the bill is in in

1112
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,639
imperfect imperfect and and allows any

1113
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:37,838
potential for a corporation to come and

1114
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:40,118
buy um come in and buy the uh uh buy the

1115
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:41,719
rights to it and or control the industry

1116
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,119
then what we're looking at in the long

1117
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:46,519
term actually very shortterm with the am

1118
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,640
amount amount of money these people have

1119
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:52,079
is pricing the people that really need

1120
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:53,598
this medicine out of the market making

1121
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,839
it completely unavailable and then it

1122
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,640
doesn't matter really how many people

1123
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:58,519
are sitting in jail we aren't talking

1124
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:00,559
about people that lost their Liv as jail

1125
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:02,280
we're actually talking about people that

1126
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,838
actually lost their lives and died

1127
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,440
because of lack of access to this

1128
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:09,759
medicine um how do you how do you feel

1129
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,280
like the organization as it stands now

1130
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,920
is able to actually uh can you can you

1131
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,480
explain to me how this bill can possibly

1132
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,318
uh protects against those those alter

1133
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,639
those those other interests that we are

1134
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:23,559
dealing with in a very real way in the

1135
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:24,960
medical community with all other kinds

1136
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:27,440
of drugs can you tell me how this bill

1137
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,960
might actually be able to protect those

1138
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,760
uh the current industry and or the

1139
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,480
patients from that reality that we are

1140
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,400
currently experiencing in The Med

1141
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,039
medical production medicinal production

1142
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,639
facilities unfortunately I can't tell

1143
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:39,800
you how it does because it does the

1144
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:42,039
opposite it actually expedites that

1145
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,359
business culture it opens the door to

1146
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:46,400
those types of ownership models it's

1147
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:48,358
great that we are getting folks out of

1148
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,318
jail cleaning up their records all of

1149
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:51,838
these things are laudable the truth of

1150
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:54,559
the matter is social and criminal

1151
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,799
justice priorities very important ones

1152
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,759
took these economic Justice Provisions

1153
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,560
hostage

1154
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,520
and it's not going to prevent that it's

1155
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:03,119
not going to protect against that it's

1156
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,400
actually worse than current law with

1157
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,039
regard to Industry Rags with regard to

1158
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,680
keeping diversity of products with

1159
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:13,639
keeping the supply chains that we have

1160
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:15,318
now intact it it it's not going to prac

1161
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:17,799
act we have a different perspective on

1162
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:20,239
that as well Amanda um well I mean we

1163
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,119
already have mcrsa right which has a

1164
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:25,279
whole licensing structure for medical

1165
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,200
right and so medical companies will be

1166
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,559
licensed in the medical system

1167
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:32,439
you know I have to address the big

1168
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:34,720
Pharma Boogeyman because we have no

1169
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,838
evidence that pharmaceutical companies

1170
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:41,239
are starting to develop cannabis for the

1171
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,719
raw plant you know protocols and and all

1172
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:44,799
of that and I know that you know oh I

1173
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:48,279
don't think see is not here anymore um I

1174
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,880
was just at a 40,000 acre legal cannabis

1175
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:55,599
grow for producing THC in Colorado

1176
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,960
40,000 Acres financed by pharmaceutical

1177
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,280
company I'm talking right no no that's

1178
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,559
no no no that's not what I'm saying

1179
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,359
though that's not what I'm saying I'm

1180
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,240
saying that in our Medical Market in

1181
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:06,598
California right now right we do not

1182
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:07,759
have because that's what the claim is

1183
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,160
right is that we're going to start

1184
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,720
licensing for medical and we're going to

1185
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:11,920
see pharmaceutical companies come in and

1186
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,799
take the licenses that's not what I'm

1187
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,079
saying I'm saying so you're saying what

1188
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,960
I'm what I'm saying is is is that you

1189
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,480
know with that amount of money on the

1190
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,440
table what's going to prevent it right

1191
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,599
for medical you're talking about medical

1192
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,559
development of Med medicine right that's

1193
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:27,960
like so again I want to make the the the

1194
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,040
distinction

1195
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,480
we have a set of medical cannabis

1196
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:34,800
regulations and if concerns about the

1197
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,400
pharmaceuticalization of that medicine

1198
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,119
concerns about the the corporatization

1199
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,920
of that medicine is a medical cannabis

1200
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:44,800
issue and that is something that we have

1201
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,318
right now we're making rules about right

1202
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,000
now so this is the time right it's the

1203
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:50,400
time to go to the food and a meetings

1204
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,239
it's time to go to the public health

1205
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,680
meetings this is all happening right now

1206
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,159
and voice exactly the concerns that

1207
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:58,519
you're voicing because they're making

1208
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:01,440
the rules for medicine in this state

1209
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:04,280
under cannabis right now what we're

1210
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,880
saying is that there are people that

1211
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,160
want to access cannabis but are not

1212
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,559
patients so we're trying to create

1213
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:14,838
something for them that will run

1214
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:16,640
alongside what we have for patients so I

1215
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:18,799
think that in terms of pharmaceutical

1216
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:20,920
involvement what we need to do is be

1217
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,160
impacting our medical cannabis

1218
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:26,000
regulations to ensure that that's that's

1219
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:27,838
where where it holds true I mean people

1220
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,280
that are already working in IAL cannabis

1221
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:33,199
this is on this is part of their

1222
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:35,200
activism right now so I mean I'm I I

1223
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:38,118
mean I don't know just just real quick

1224
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,879
prop 64 actually prohibits a lensy from

1225
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:42,400
ad advertising their product as a

1226
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,838
medical product so if you have a license

1227
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,960
under prop 64 you can't sell it as as

1228
00:44:44,838 --> 00:44:48,358
medicine whatsoever so there would be no

1229
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,039
benefit to any sort of big farm of

1230
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:51,960
Boogeyman the other reality is as long

1231
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:53,719
as there's it's federally legal it's

1232
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,559
going to most corporations that any have

1233
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:56,719
any sort of type of federal contracts

1234
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:59,200
it's going to make it difficult for them

1235
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:00,439
to get into into the industry as a whole

1236
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:01,919
that's why you're not seeing you know

1237
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,880
Farm is like that's why it's going to be

1238
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,159
difficult for say a Walgreens to to get

1239
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,680
a license for this because they have a

1240
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,078
federal license to to to sell their

1241
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,279
drugs and as long as it's federally

1242
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:13,160
illegal it's we are going to have a head

1243
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,079
start to be able to Sprint as quickly as

1244
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:16,719
possible to establish The Branding to

1245
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,400
establish the marketplace but it is

1246
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,519
going to be a Sprint because those money

1247
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,920
interests are there we'll give you a

1248
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:24,759
couple different perspectives there hi

1249
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,358
good afternoon um so I had a couple

1250
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,839
quick questions one uh in reference of

1251
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:30,000
what you were just saying

1252
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:31,679
um something interesting from Washington

1253
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,880
was when and I don't know if it still

1254
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:38,719
exists but as soon as i502 rolled in and

1255
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,559
there was retail cannabis um somebody

1256
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:44,399
that was walking into to a recreational

1257
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:46,400
dispensary wasn't allowed to or the

1258
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,800
workers at that establishment were not

1259
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,318
even allowed to engage or talk about any

1260
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,440
aspect of the medicinal effect of

1261
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,279
cannabis or certain

1262
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,039
phytotherapeutic because you know since

1263
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:01,359
cannabis and medicine and recreational

1264
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:03,880
are kind of intrinsically connected um

1265
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,400
what is is California going to with if

1266
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,240
Elma passes and there's wck shops is it

1267
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,119
going to be something like that where

1268
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:12,318
there not just can't be any claims on a

1269
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:14,160
product about medicinal benefit but are

1270
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:15,759
the people at the shops not even going

1271
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:18,159
to be able to talk about

1272
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,359
cannabis um um what what type of

1273
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:23,118
Productions or considerations um do you

1274
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:25,799
see um being put in place with either of

1275
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,960
the bills around um other types of

1276
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,160
models that have existed like the Wham

1277
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,400
model in the philanthropic giving model

1278
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:34,879
to serve poor and low income and to

1279
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,720
specialize and focus in these certain

1280
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,838
areas and is that something that's going

1281
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:41,639
to go away um you know as everything

1282
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:43,199
becomes profiti and for profit etc etc

1283
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:44,719
according to FDA you can't put on there

1284
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,799
like this is going to cure this disease

1285
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,519
and right you're not allowed to make any

1286
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,640
medical claims there's absolutely

1287
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,519
nothing that's going to prevent people

1288
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,400
from educating people about cannabis at

1289
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:53,880
every point in the road and I think you

1290
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,920
know now that we're getting to the point

1291
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,440
where the public is listening right and

1292
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,599
they're like oh this can thing you know

1293
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,480
maybe this is something that we could

1294
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:02,920
really stand behind we're the

1295
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,679
ambassadors so it's going to be up to us

1296
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,920
to ensure that the new people that come

1297
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:08,000
on board you know don't have their

1298
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,519
Marine doubt experiences that they're

1299
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,679
educated about how to use properly and I

1300
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:13,800
think that that's going to be a really

1301
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,358
important part of implementation um and

1302
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,640
something that I'm actually excited to

1303
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:20,440
participate

1304
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:22,480
in and then Wham the Wham like model oh

1305
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,000
um I was actually going to not speak to

1306
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,480
the first one and only to the second one

1307
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,280
so maybe we um I think that the Wham

1308
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,880
model is most accurately described as a

1309
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,400
consumer Cooperative which unfortunately

1310
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,280
uh three types of co-ops are not

1311
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,680
authorized under current law or under

1312
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,599
prop 64 we need to work on that either

1313
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:43,279
way which is a great opportunity for me

1314
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:45,680
to briefly remind everybody that vote

1315
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,800
your heart vote your conscience don't

1316
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,879
attack people that disagree with you we

1317
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,559
need each other more the day after for

1318
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,720
things like this it's okay to be neutral

1319
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,000
neutral is not the same as oppose in

1320
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,838
that Spirit uh come upstairs and join Jo

1321
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,358
us at 5:30 7 minutes ago for a reception

1322
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:04,159
Refreshments let's be a community again

1323
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:05,838
let's remember that we're all in this

1324
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:07,598
together because that in my opinion is

1325
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:10,440
what matters most and and let's all keep

1326
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,440
telling the truth about

1327
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:16,280
cannabis hi thanks um I have a different

1328
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:19,519
perspective I'm I'm a local government

1329
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:22,519
attorney and um I just wanted to note

1330
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:25,719
the the new the difference between mcrsa

1331
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:27,318
and um prop 64 and that under mcrsa it's

1332
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:29,558
a dual licensing scheme where you need a

1333
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:32,119
state license and a local license under

1334
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:34,480
prop 64 you only need a state license

1335
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:36,880
but you cannot operate if it's banned in

1336
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,199
that local jurisdiction so right now

1337
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,559
these local jurisdictions are exploring

1338
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:45,000
their regulatory options and it's really

1339
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:47,280
a shame when um there aren't balanced

1340
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,159
substantive objective discussions on

1341
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,599
these topics so what I've seen thus far

1342
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:54,798
when uh councils and commissions are

1343
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:57,359
discussing this are very one-sided

1344
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:59,358
arguments as far as the audience goes

1345
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:01,400
just you know very reform manous type

1346
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:03,199
stuff so you know to the extent you know

1347
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,639
I would recommend you know getting out

1348
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:07,719
there um and and allowing for more

1349
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:11,318
balanced discussions on this and my

1350
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:12,598
question is um with with local taxes we

1351
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:15,199
have a lot in November that are going to

1352
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:17,079
be considered an anticipation of prop 64

1353
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:20,399
is there a real fear that excessive

1354
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:22,359
taxation May fuel the black marget um oh

1355
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,280
absolutely um I think you know getting

1356
00:49:22,358 --> 00:49:25,798
the price and the tax right is something

1357
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,400
that we look at other Industries I mean

1358
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:29,639
it's one of the big control we have over

1359
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,079
tobacco and alcohol right so I mean of

1360
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:33,000
course the the concern is that if you

1361
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:35,280
make the tax too high you fuel the

1362
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,920
illicit Market um if you make you make

1363
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,559
the tax too low then people over consume

1364
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,400
so you know you have to try to find that

1365
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:46,000
middle ground um and we will we will

1366
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,838
there's a whole cor there's a whole uh

1367
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,679
sector of academic research just on

1368
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:52,199
alcohol price elasticity that's just on

1369
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:53,960
you know how do we fix the price of the

1370
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:55,639
tax just right to get the outcome we

1371
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,798
want in terms of Public Health and

1372
00:49:55,639 --> 00:50:00,679
luckily in prop 16 before there's $4

1373
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:02,440
million allocated every year to a UC

1374
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:04,480
institution to do Public Health

1375
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,838
implementation research so we can look

1376
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,480
and see did use go up where did it go up

1377
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:10,199
where are things being concentrated

1378
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,199
something we didn't talk about who's

1379
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:14,399
getting licenses in the industry and are

1380
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:15,480
we ensuring that people that are diverse

1381
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,440
and the people that have been most

1382
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,240
impacted are also getting licenses this

1383
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,960
is all part of the implementation work

1384
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:24,159
that will be funded by the

1385
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,000
initiative so um I'm not going to ask my

1386
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:28,199
usual questions or repeat my stuff

1387
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,719
everyone knows how I feel about people

1388
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:31,000
not being able to smoke in their cars or

1389
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:32,279
public consumption and all of those

1390
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,358
things however something that I'm

1391
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:38,240
confused about with 64 is why hemp is

1392
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:39,558
regulated with cannabis um within that

1393
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:41,399
bill it's just confusing to me because I

1394
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:42,559
don't understand the strategy or is it

1395
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,318
are we going to be able to split it up

1396
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,440
so the industrial hemp can have its own

1397
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:49,719
regulation then cannabis can go move

1398
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,119
forward so yeah um right so we actually

1399
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:53,679
had a hemp bill that was passed a few

1400
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,838
years ago in California s SP 566 by

1401
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:58,399
Senator Leno and it basically said as

1402
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:59,960
soon as it's able to have be under

1403
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,720
California law that we're going to go

1404
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,000
ahead and add hemp to whatever we're

1405
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:05,598
doing um so I think that's probably why

1406
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,719
it just got added in the definition so

1407
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,359
it's like we're basically changing the

1408
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:10,199
definition of what is legal behavior and

1409
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:12,598
what is illegal behavior and so we're

1410
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:15,078
adding that licensed cultivation is now

1411
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:16,880
legal of cannabis and of hemp

1412
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:19,280
manufacturing license manufacturing is

1413
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,798
now legal of cannabis and of hemp but

1414
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,680
there are definitely differences in how

1415
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:25,239
it needs to be regulated not just in

1416
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:27,919
terms of you know um access and things

1417
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:29,759
like that but you know pollen spread and

1418
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,519
stuff like that so that again going back

1419
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,839
to really getting excited about having

1420
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,559
these Allied organizations that before

1421
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:37,920
you know maybe weren't so engaged with

1422
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:39,559
us like farming organizations and people

1423
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,079
that really believe in hemp there's a

1424
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:44,480
huge hemp you know group out there

1425
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,480
that's ready to embrace this and so yes

1426
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,280
I think that it'll be very easy to place

1427
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,798
that um where it's more appropriate as

1428
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,400
we learn more about what that looks like

1429
00:51:49,798 --> 00:51:54,079
in the context of

1430
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,240
legalization that's excellent that will

1431
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,880
conclude this session thank you all for

1432
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:02,039
attending

1433
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,039
for being here for the great dialogue
