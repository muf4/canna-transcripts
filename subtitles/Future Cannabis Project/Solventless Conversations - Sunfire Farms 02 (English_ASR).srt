6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:24,329
yeah just like two more I mean this

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:29,130
one's kind of low this is papaya lava

8
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:32,070
cake pie yeah that's awesome so this is

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:36,420
uh there's like this is actually papaya

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:39,238
og mixed with lava cake both I got as a

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,910
clone gifts and that is why yeah both

12
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:45,509
goddess clone gifts and so the papaya og

13
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:47,488
isn't like that

14
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:48,659
papaya fee know that everyone's like

15
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:51,000
washing that house like that's super

16
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,769
like papaya turn but it's still pretty

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,659
prevalent when mixed with a lava cake

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,270
it's got a little bit of like a gas eNOS

19
00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:00,839
to it but yeah I don't think I've tried

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,489
the papaya before yeah but it's still

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,558
there like you can still sense that like

22
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:06,298
tropical kind of vibe yeah wings a

23
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,390
tropical bat hit it I'm never good at

24
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:13,080
describing like flavors but yeah it's

25
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:22,319
like a tropical like punch right like

26
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:23,908
juice apple juice I wish I coming up I

27
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,228
was like kind of just wanted to wash up

28
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,210
a pie on its own and I'm kind of mama

29
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:29,700
didn't but what's that um these are both

30
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:36,078
Wi-Fi cookies right here just like

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:38,430
different like consistencies oh yeah

32
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,349
that's the last of it actually

33
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,659
so papaya was just one big full-term

34
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:54,030
plant this year's angle them this way

35
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:57,149
like that yeah 170 190 okay in 72 190 so

36
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,280
pretty much everything but the one well

37
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,310
189 yeah so everything about the 190 bag

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,640
and then 40 they did not include this is

39
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,310
the 40 right here though separate oh

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,989
yeah interesting a Wi-Fi this one's been

41
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,250
in the fridge for like a month and a

42
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,930
half I haven't dad out of this in a

43
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,430
minute

44
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,260
that's correct it's like it always

45
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,239
changes a lot in the fridge a little bit

46
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:19,188
like I don't know to say like

47
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:22,158
crystallizes or it gets like more wet or

48
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:25,459
sometimes it'll like get less wet but

49
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:28,219
more like yeah no it does like what you

50
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:30,049
say it is improving so I like it yeah I

51
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:31,878
feel like he improves like not the fresh

52
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:33,829
press like The Fresh Prince stays the

53
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:35,449
same in the fridge but the like the

54
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:37,489
stuff that you make and like wet batter

55
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:37,938
and like you cold cure but what's this

56
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:42,349
one

57
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:44,479
oh the Wi-Fi cookies which is another

58
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:46,848
one that I was like hunting through this

59
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,189
year from from clueless and clone to

60
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:54,798
like and that was a good hash or else

61
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:57,500
one yeah this is almost like minty or

62
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:59,450
like uplifting yeah yeah it's kind of

63
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,000
more happy just smelt like the terpene

64
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:06,919
to be just like keep smelling on no I

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,459
feel that yeah my oh gee that's it I

66
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:12,318
believe that's it yeah this is just a

67
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,000
full spectrum right here what's that bad

68
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,729
oh this is the night no I show you the

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,340
90 oh this oh this is little hash press

70
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:21,378
I made this food I can barely really

71
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,060
last but like I didn't really make the

72
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:24,469
full thing but I had a little bit of

73
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,259
help but I made the little implosion

74
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:29,598
kind of and I connected it I made the I

75
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:31,789
pushed out the little press though yeah

76
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,108
cuz that for just like fighting hash

77
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:35,209
yeah yeah

78
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:39,250
Oh like like like full mill hat yeah

79
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:43,810
like this press oh yeah she's right now

80
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,810
let's see where's that melts

81
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:56,310
here it is so nice he never pressed out

82
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,990
hash before this is already pretty

83
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:03,090
greasy but take out a bit here I super

84
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,980
greasy that's awesome yeah that's a

85
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,640
straight hat that's a why shit

86
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:12,959
yeah it's a nice you know Qi grant -

87
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,369
game jar so a nice little p5 or so for

88
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,980
us I mean you could finger press it like

89
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,930
you don't need right but it's nice to

90
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,319
kind of get it nice and thin and whatnot

91
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,209
like there's a finger press but that's

92
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,819
like super thick you can press it into

93
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:31,560
more dabs and stuff so get the little

94
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:34,529
press you can just use a dab or two or

95
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,850
like a flathead dabber just but you

96
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:37,769
don't want to get it too high you've

97
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,439
really barely need any heat I just flash

98
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:42,599
it with the torch and yeah press your

99
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,759
out this this process is pretty small so

100
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,830
it's good right kind of shitty but it

101
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,899
works it works small batches

102
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:53,459
yeah it's mini you know it's portable I

103
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:56,129
just have this really nice like resin

104
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:58,680
extract press it was like this big like

105
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,629
flat like this wide I could just like so

106
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,759
sorry this stuff you just put in there

107
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:05,040
is basically like right before you would

108
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,750
press it yeah then you're pressing it at

109
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,120
the last minute instead of pressing in

110
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,790
advance right yeah I'm just kind of like

111
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,829
pressing this press yeah it's pretty

112
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,800
much like just being pressed out and

113
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:18,180
flattened into a patty with like minimal

114
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,040
heat instead of actually being like

115
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,290
pressed we're like the rosin oil is

116
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,129
secreting it's just still the live heads

117
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:31,260
dude my my cap is being so sketchy

118
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:32,759
okay so expensive calf to break you

119
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,949
don't want that to break I should really

120
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:39,209
put that on the brakes that one again um

121
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:40,800
this is binary mothership - binary just

122
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:43,339
like their carb cap series that they do

123
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,020
yeah here's the house pressed out yeah

124
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:50,929
he's kind of lying huh yeah back in

125
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,930
there or a flag people called flags yeah

126
00:05:55,129 --> 00:06:01,350
yeah too good way to monitor but yeah

127
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,430
it's all good I'm up for a challenge

128
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:08,090
yeah take a phat flag oh man coach it

129
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,230

130
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:11,819
yeah I don't press too much I mean I

131
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,620
don't smoke too much full mount like

132

this you know yeah and it's just such a

133

with like that all right cuz back in the

146
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,049
day before people are pressing Ross and

147
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,478
like this was a this was like the thing

148
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,189
to do like press out your hash you know

149
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:10,069
like cut your flag cuz it's like the

150
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:12,149
truth it's like the tradition the vibe

151
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:14,849
hopefully that doesn't fall off I don't

152
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:18,120
like to I don't like to use these little

153
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:22,650
beads when I'm smoking full mouth kind

154
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,090
of annoying and why is that um when

155
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,189
you're q-tipping it like it's hard to

156
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:29,788
get all the hash off the bead and I just

157
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:31,469
kind of I don't know kind of stays hot

158
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:32,969
longer than the banger does I feel like

159
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,370
I can kind of scorch your hash at times

160
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,940
it's kind of get I get better temps just

161
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,509
like without it

162
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:39,509
so

163
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:49,000

197
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:35,740
truly shows thanks yeah my hash didn't

198
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:38,409
last it always went fast

199
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,480
yeah just smoked it right away right I

200
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:41,799
never had time the experiment was like

201
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,200
cold curing keeping it in the fridge

202
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:45,699
yeah for sure I have one jar it's I'm

203
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,910
leaving in there now and see what's up

204
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,129
nice yeah oh yeah definitely it's like

205
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:53,110
that cold cure thing is a really broad

206
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:55,450
term because most people who are called

207
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,250
cold curing aren't actually curing it in

208
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,770
the cold they'd like just a room temp

209
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,700
hearing

210
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:08,480
and calling cold cure but it's pocket

211
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:09,200
not hot room temp cure so do you go a

212
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,629
little longer

213
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:17,150
are you um this is a pretty fat dad will

214
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:20,509
probably go like 145 and I might be hot

215
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:23,149
though no no do it sorry that's how long

216
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:26,360
you're letting it cool down for ya the

217
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:29,269
Banger which is for sometimes it's like

218
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,889
kind of long you know one minute is

219
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:32,750
usually what I have mine but they're all

220
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:35,120
every glass piece is different yeah

221
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:39,799
so then what temperature is it would be

222
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:45,769
like heat it with the torch for 20 so

223
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:47,240
whatever I like so this I had the

224
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:49,309
temperature that this nail was when I

225
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,210
just dabbed it was probably around like

226
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:54,589
five hundred eighty degrees my buddies

227
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:58,940
have like that temp tech it's like a

228
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:00,590
little gauge yeah we're so super honored

229
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:07,970
or the other one that goes on our needle

230
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:10,160
oh yeah I've used them both I guess like

231
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,110
their temperature reading like on the

232
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,730
terpolymer you're supposed to like we go

233
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,250
at 380 and then the other one we go like

234
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,539
580 but you see younger dial it you know

235
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,950
matter what it says like you just dial

236
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:21,259
it in and what your temp is and then I

237
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:27,290
use the wrist tech you know hold you

238
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:29,330
wrist above it right I don't know timers

239
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:31,219
always good is knowing the glass yeah

240
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,259
takes if you maybe it takes a few hot to

241
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,210
have maybe a few cold dabs

242
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,340
so you can always reheat it though hold

243
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,300
your cold start get some more key tips I

244

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,440
pretty rarely I don't really like taking

248
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,299

293
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:26,779
weight like a morning session you get

294
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,490
our code a what do you call that way can

295
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:30,079

326
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:54,399

00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:59,139
little cold okay yeah a little little

328
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,669

00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:04,809
like no or later than that what are our

330
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:06,639
expectations right now full flavor and

331
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:08,679
it'll be cool you can prepare that

332
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:24,069
hopefully a little yeah punch to the

333
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:26,379
chest no it looks pretty good actually

334
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:31,870
it just looks the full Mel like if you

335
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:33,639
go a little too high you can like hurt

336
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,230
the flavor yeah a little bit you can get

337
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:38,379
more of a hashey flavor than the tofu

338
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,720
flavor but how was it perfect nice oh

339
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:42,789
this is actually smelled more chirpy

340
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,730
than how she sews right on there like

341
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:47,740
yeah yeah yeah yeah and it's good to get

342
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,430
that you get that punch to it with the

343
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:54,250
hotter melt dad's for sure so when you

344
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:58,359

351
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:18,970
like sometimes a big oh oh usually you

352
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:20,500
should I got a buddy he was like oh you

353
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,210
should stick to this like these two

354
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,759
strands you know the other one I gave it

355
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:27,310
a be like okay man

356
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,110
but no it's true like we were watching a

357
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:30,429
bunch of strange like other things are

358
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,680
better than others and like you got a

359
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:34,659
you know not everything's to be great

360
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,519
but that's the process of making things

361
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:39,189
that everything's gonna be great you

362
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,329
know yeah it's like you know maybe

363
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,760
you'll release it once but you're not

364
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:46,990
gonna continuously release something so

365
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:48,519
it's all part of the process like I've

366
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,639
only been washing my own material for

367
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:53,409
like six months so my baby news is like

368
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,330
blazing people out or smoke em out is

369
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:58,269
the whole temp thing because I don't

370
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,800
have like the you know yeah monitor was

371
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:01,179
worried like oh is it too hot because

372
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:06,490
that will taint the flavor and they'll

373
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:08,889
turn someone off right I tried to that's

374
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:12,039
why you gotta educate that low temp yeah

375
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,449
for for ice ash you know right educate

376
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,959
them on where it's coming from how it's

377
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,880
made

378
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,640
do that and build the value behind it I

379
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,850
think yeah but I think it's I think it's

380
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,910
building for sure the market and the

381
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:27,909
need right especially with the whole

382
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:30,070
like the epidemic they're you know

383
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,860
they're calling it now yeah it's kind of

384
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:36,849
open the doors and it's like these about

385
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:39,428
like madness yeah about like you people

386

hating like usually there's always gonna

387
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:43,840
be haters but like usually they're your

388
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,610
haters are people that are like doing a

389
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:51,629
lot less than then you're doing you know

390
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:53,919

like yeah you know it's it's great you

393
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,809

00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,650
hash is definitely a scalable yeah it's

398
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:13,149
gonna be like we need more guys like you

399

to doing small craft keep order and look

400
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,380
for that just like the beer brewers out

401
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,059

402
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,640

00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:29,200
looking for like tons of money and live

406
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,090
this like baller lifestyle they just

407
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,690
want to have a good living and growing

408
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:36,779
crops maybe cannabis and all right so

409
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,880
it's like freedom

410
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:41,789
it was how kind of California cannabis

411
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,340
played out is that five years ago it was

412
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:46,409
all craft people yeah the husband and

413
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:49,500
wife in their kitchen who were making

414
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:52,259
like tinctures and salads and bombs

415
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,759
fighters you meet them at events and

416
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:56,309
they'd have a booth and they'd be all

417
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,319
proud about what I made maybe like we

418
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:00,899
just hired our first employee like as a

419
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,460
small business you just hired someone

420
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,610
and this is her she's our head of sales

421
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:10,110
and marketing right and like just the

422
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:12,240
joy everyone had right and then like so

423
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:14,429
those people were like deer like Bambi

424
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:21,599
out to slaughter like I know here comes

425
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:26,269
legalization and like it's really our

426
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:29,189
Burien hordes of yeah - America's right

427
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:30,629
just a picture there's like a pig is

428
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,350
ripping out all these beautiful plants

429
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,790
my Gardens thing so my point is crazy

430
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:37,980
they could have structured the

431
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:40,649
regulations in a way that was like you

432
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,230
know what we want to be an industry like

433
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,910
think about alcoholic beverage there

434
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,160
there's like two companies that control

435
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,900
distribution and they just bite like

436
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,259
anytime a small brain comes up they just

437
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:54,930
buy them same with soft drinks quick

438
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:57,059
Coke and Pepsi and then like cell phones

439
00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:00,060
it's like five companies so California

440
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:02,039
cannabis could have been like we want to

441
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:03,990
be a mom and topic because you can

442
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:06,539
you're closed you're just one state that

443
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:09,089
can kind of like set its own courts for

444
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,399
sure so they could have been like we're

445
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:13,109
gonna structure it so only mom-and-pop

446
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,200
companies can exist for like five years

447
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:18,029
yeah and then I guess planted a little

448
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,190
rude yeah it's like we don't need one

449
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:22,200
company owning every dispensary like

450
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,720
Starbucks owns every coffee shop for

451
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,650
like McDonald's owns every other side of

452
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,650
highway Ronnie tuggs

453
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:38,970
lobbyists and all that money coming in

454
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:40,440
but anyway coughs I don't know what that

455
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,940
hit me in the chest pretty good

456
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,740
nice yeah perfect hell yeah sick but

457
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,809
yeah it's crazy like working out the

458
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,400
dispenser like seeing sales reps from I

459
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:52,859
used to be like you were in hobby

460
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,059
growers actually come in that grew the

461
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:56,250
material and now I like having these

462
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:58,980
sales artists being like this is calm

463
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:01,380
and it's the best and like we have the

464
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,900

469
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:20,910

470
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:23,039
like shut up like you're yeah like that

471

00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:29,579
calling calm and all that stuff yeah

474
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,890
it's like ruining people's hard work

475
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:33,599
that worked to breathe like those

476

well uplift like the least he could do

480
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:46,829
is like strain that it is way better

481
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:49,740
because it has the names have meaning

482
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:51,629
behind it right like and that's what I

483

485
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,850
be like newbies need to be educated but

486
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,029
they could just do it in a different way

487
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:01,799
I don't know newbies need educated big

488
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:03,389
time that's why I pick when you

489
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,879
mentioned like the budtender I pictured

490
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,220
first time smoker gets a job behind the

491
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,960
counter she's just happy first time

492
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,569
smoking oh yeah this does make me calm

493
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,340
you know that's true so so they got you

494
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:16,649
at the dispensary we're dealing with

495
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:19,049
both like sales reps replacing the

496
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:21,720
farmers and then bud tenders who like

497
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:23,339
are like I just graduated college and

498
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,880
I've never smoked a joint before in my

499
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:26,159
life

500
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,320
yeah and that's your new like the person

501
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,950
you're working with is yeah definitely

502
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,720
it's like maybe they they smoked before

503
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,029
but it's like between soil it you're

504
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,679
like this yeah it's it's wrong man it's

505
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:39,299
tough being next to people that yeah

506
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,740
aren't passionate like you are and

507
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,839
you're getting you know paid a similar

508
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,009
price that they're getting you know

509
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:46,558
similar rate that they're getting paid

510
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:49,529

00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:38,000
yeah we got the tutorials coming up next

550
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:39,019
up next uh Oh the drive met didn't you

551
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,990
bring a tray did you

552
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:43,609
I forgot it you ain't no way I'm sure

553
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,589
it's just like it's normal paper it is

554
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:51,289
it's it's like it's like seven inches

555
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:53,779
wide by like 20 for the freeze dry

556
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:55,668
freeze right right if you always see

557
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:57,678
those people like posting full trays and

558
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:59,120
like I feel like a lot of people think

559
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,250
they're like bigger than they are

560
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,048
they're really not that large yeah but

561
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,849
you can fit a lot of hash on there like

562
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:07,369
and it also depends on how thick it is

563
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:09,529
like I can I've like posted pictures

564
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:10,819
like a full tray of hash that is a lot

565
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:13,039
of hash there's like a hundred grams or

566
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:14,599
so on there but like I've also seen

567
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,569
other full trays that probably have a

568
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:20,359
lot more because of how like dense yeah

569
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:22,279
it's like you can fit so much hash in

570
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:24,918
the end those small fries jars it's how

571
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:27,200
deep is it isn't um it's like a half

572
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:30,620
inch or maybe three-quarters it's very

573
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:35,779
deep do you uh is there can you not go

574
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:37,939
heal and go so deep as I recommend the

575
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:39,589
better but like you can go pretty thick

576
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:43,580
like I've loaded a lot on a tray and it

577
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:46,459
dries perfectly you know so it's just

578
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:49,308
like knowing how long like it takes to

579
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,200
dry and it also like depends on uh oh my

580
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:55,339
good cool

581
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,919
it depends on like the like how much

582
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:59,808
water is in there the hash when we put

583
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,400
it on the tray you know okay I'm sure

584
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,470
you try and like wick a good amount of

585
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,809
the moisture out before you I want so

586
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,819
hot yeah yeah almost along with the

587
00:26:05,808 --> 00:26:10,369
freeze jar you can kind of like pour

588
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:11,750
what hash it and yeah pour it'll dry it

589
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:13,308
but like I'm a little envious on you

590
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,769
guys look cuz you guys just you could

591
00:26:13,308 --> 00:26:18,289
just do that always right it's it's

592
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:20,509
quick yeah but like it's better to dry

593
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:22,369
it if when you do dry it on leaving the

594
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:25,940
bag and like you know wick a lot out

595
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:31,029
it'll uh I would say like 140 oh there's

596
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:39,590
no fucking bead in there 135 okay um but

597
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:41,298

me about yours okay I mean mine's like

646
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:53,509
super standard it's like what everyone

647
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:54,859
does but like his I mean you could

648
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:57,289
obviously talk about her about than I do

649
00:28:54,859 --> 00:29:00,829
but from my going up going off of his

650
00:28:57,289 --> 00:29:01,849
Instagram post like it's like an air

651
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:03,409
drawing but it's like

652
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:06,168
a controlled environment like a beer

653
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,910
fridge right yeah so like it's just

654
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:10,280
being dried in a very cold like

655
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:12,288
controlled like I don't know if you can

656
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:15,619
control humidity or not you know what I

657
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:16,970
have it yeah I'm sure

658
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:19,308
cuz I'm I think looks like it dries

659
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:22,160
quickly yeah dries yeah I'm sure it's

660
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:23,839
like a lower but uh yeah so it's cool

661
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,090
instead of like having to like have a

662
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,889
full cold room because like if you want

663
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:30,019
to air dry hash that's like of quality

664
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:32,240
you need to have a cold room that's like

665
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:34,639
so the hash won't grease and it needs to

666
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,769
be dry so the hash can dry and like come

667
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,990
on having that yeah it's like almost

668
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:40,908
like a freeze dryer but it's like like

669
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:43,099
having a little space but it's on the

670
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:46,010
conversation other the other day you

671
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:48,740
start with frozen material or yeah so

672
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:50,808
like the only material that I can source

673
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,490
and now I kind of only really want to

674
00:29:50,808 --> 00:29:55,308
source is my own so it's just all fresh

675
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,839
frozen for my stuff I remember they were

676
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:59,990
talking about like instead of freezing

677
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:02,689
it just like five days after yeah

678
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:04,190
harvest like when it's cured yeah take

679
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,950
that immediate have you ever tried doing

680
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:08,538
that I haven't I've wanted to like do it

681
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,370
especially with some strains that have

682
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:12,230
it yielded because their point if

683
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:14,000
there's nothing no persona the freezer

684
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,279
better than when it won it right like

685
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,288
it's not like you pull like frozen

686
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:20,119
carrots out of the freezing are like

687
00:30:18,288 --> 00:30:22,879
these are much better than like the

688
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:25,668
fresh you know though yeah yeah it's

689
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,110
like I don't know it's a lot of I feel

690
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:30,140
like everyone's like I want fresh frozen

691
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:32,329
only but like with yields I think it

692
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,679
would help yells a lot worse with drying

693
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:35,750
and especially with strains that might

694
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,970
not be heavy yielders with with with

695
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,890
being fresh frozen like the trichomes

696
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:43,610
are gonna be way easier to knock off at

697
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:46,700
that time and like like people should

698
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:48,649
just dry whole plants and like just wash

699
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,450
them instead of washing trim nugs

700
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,190
because like you're you're like

701
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,600
molesting all those trichomes when

702
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,250
you're trimming it and like if you just

703
00:30:53,599 --> 00:31:00,319
have that whole plant that's like super

704
00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:01,640
like well yeah I like you trimming right

705
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,349
like when I even when I do the fresh

706
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,030
frozen like I put it in the bags and

707
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:06,379
turkey bag and then try and like when

708
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,210
it's in the freeze like I don't want to

709
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:11,960
just quickly with you all your flower

710
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:14,450
goes into your hatch yeah yeah just the

711
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,410
trim it like yeah yeah the best parts

712
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,779
yeah like nothing

713
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:20,269
stridor plan yeah yeah you do leave all

714
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:21,470
the coal maybe before um yeah well when

715
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:23,359
I'm prepping the fresh frozen like I

716
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:25,670
think every family fought that doesn't

717
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:28,039
have resin on it but like all like leave

718
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:29,900
anything that has resin well like trim

719
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:31,279
around like big leaf so I only have a

720
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,200
little bit of resin I like trim off the

721
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,200
main parts of the leaf and shit I

722
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,920
acquired like some trim from a guy up in

723
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,799
Santa Cruz

724
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:42,500
nice she gave me some like some trim out

725
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:43,759
there for sure oh this is really good he

726
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,849
gave me some trim and then he gave me

727
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,109
some leaf nice I want something maybe on

728
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:50,750
you on the ground yeah it has recently

729
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:52,699
Wow yeah good your grams of lead yeah it

730
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:55,009
had it had the bag you know I had try

731
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:57,170
comes in it yeah and it did yielded so

732
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:59,450
word that's why I was wondering for you

733
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,310
to leave or not you know hold yeah yeah

734
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,830
yeah some they don't all have try comes

735
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:05,419
with some do yeah totally there's there

736
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:08,990
everywhere and you separate it you know

737
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:11,060
yeah you do all the micron bags or a bed

738
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:13,579
by now you probably kind of know yeah

739
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:15,409
what range you want to yeah I'd various

740
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:18,349
like if I'm washing for Rozz and only do

741
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:20,900
a specific from washing four mil Oh I

742
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:22,939
usually do like all the bags on the

743
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,940
first wash if I'm going for a melt you

744
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:27,950
know for the first wash like and then

745
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,110
cuz to get like the most filtration to

746
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:33,230
get the Mel theist like resin in the

747
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:37,459
nineteen 120 so I'll use like two 2191

748
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:39,230
60 120 90 and I never really use a 70

749
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,019
bag on the first wash I just kind of let

750
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:43,910
that fall into the 40 and I use that for

751
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:45,769
like for my rosin you so you don't think

752
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:47,360
is melt in that set like anything whoa

753
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:51,079
there probably will be melt in the 70

754
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:53,119
actually but like I don't know there I I

755
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:56,480
feel like there's so much more in the 90

756
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:59,599
in the 120 like I think I there was like

757
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,789
a 4% yield in the 90 you first wash when

758
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,579
I did this dhania uh-hmm which is like

759
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:07,759
pretty day I was like well that's for

760
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:09,980
just the 90 yeah for just a full melt so

761
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,720
I was like dang that's awesome I think

762
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,950
going back to like fresh froze and then

763
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:17,750
I'll just do two back for the rest of

764
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:19,610
everything my bad no worries yeah what

765
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,960
do you find that range yeah yeah do two

766
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:24,199
bags are there for the full spectrum

767
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,970
yeah yeah 160 45 whenever I explain to

768
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,200
people like the full spectrum like

769
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,460
people someone doesn't know about it

770
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,220
yeah I learned

771
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:34,038
Phil mentioned like the head and the

772
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,659
tail end yeah so I explained it now like

773
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:38,269
if you think of like the 220 could be

774
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:40,820
like the head you know and then the toes

775
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:42,829
are like that the 25 you know so the

776
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:44,329
head and tail end yeah and so I try to

777
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:46,999
explain to people like full specs like

778
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:51,528
the main body you know yeah so usually

779
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:53,269
like 160 did like 45 you know but like

780
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:56,829
you I've seen some here like it was a

781
00:33:53,269 --> 00:34:00,470
180 like the 190 bag yeah higher has

782
00:33:56,829 --> 00:34:03,499
control fires right right it's like and

783
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:05,058
especially with like if anyone's

784
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:07,579
listening to this their message directly

785
00:34:05,058 --> 00:34:09,318
like people need to listen to this all

786
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:11,568
these new rosin smokers first of all

787
00:34:09,318 --> 00:34:20,628
people are an hour and a half into this

788
00:34:11,568 --> 00:34:22,308
conversation comment nineteen like I

789
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:24,799

that we do that's sick yeah you you were

792
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:33,558
talking about what he does that's oh

793
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:35,769
they're drying oh yeah his drying

794
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:38,000
process yeah bring way back yeah right

795
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:39,259
yeah we're just saying it's just like a

796
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,940
unique like I feel like he's probably

797
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,849
the only guy doing it like the

798
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,019
controlled air drying environment you

799
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:47,119
know I don't know I've never seen any

800
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:48,980
guys doing big racks and big rooms like

801
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,990
you're saying yeah but that's just like

802
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,510
standard air dries like I feel like once

803
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:54,739
now that we're seeing out if this is the

804
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,780
word eating out I'm sure I'm not the

805
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:59,179
only one doing it but like the beer

806
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:02,569
fridge is a great step before the freeze

807
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:04,098
dry yeah a batch for a small batch yeah

808
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:06,289
and even you come sure you can fit a lot

809
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:06,559
in there to you by like you can I have

810
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:08,719
it

811
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,760
it's I'm sure it's like less six it's

812
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:12,709
not as much as a freeze dryer right it's

813
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:18,230
like a little more less expensive dude

814
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:20,298
it's so I got lucky you had to connect

815
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:23,059
through my old job like I had a connect

816
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:25,159
that guy that had him that was like 160

817
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:27,769
for this like name the brand is called

818
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:29,118
Fogle that I got right and it is a beer

819
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:32,809
fridge is like you know it's this wide

820
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:36,470
that tall it's the one thing the fridge

821
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:38,150
dryer you know and it's cool you could

822
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:39,469
definitely customize it to fit a

823
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,930
shitload of racks and

824
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:43,969
nice right now I've only touched it once

825
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:46,818
and I have like four racks for it you

826
00:35:43,969 --> 00:35:49,098
know yeah yeah and but yeah like soon my

827
00:35:46,818 --> 00:35:50,960
reinvest and like slowly reinvesting you

828
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:52,880
know how that is yeah yeah know what in

829
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,920
all things I think about all like the

830
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,838
stuff that people pull in it's like

831
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,880
innovation from some other industry

832
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:01,190
right leg other light like the Seri

833
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,510
pompous yeah ruin like people always do

834
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:07,880
it in plastic you know vortex Brewers

835
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:10,369
but you should technically do it in like

836
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,318
stainless steel because when you when

837
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:16,068
you clean a black tag like all the

838
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:18,050
microbes don't get all right a pathogens

839
00:36:16,068 --> 00:36:19,940
off like something the plastic has so

840
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:22,130
many ridges and nooks and crannies it's

841
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,568
not a smooth flat straight like that's

842
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:26,119
why you don't see people doing like

843
00:36:23,568 --> 00:36:30,409
yogurt making and you're making in

844
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:32,000
plastic stainless steel same came with

845
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:33,710
the hash you know that's another good

846
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,318
upgrade is to the stainless steel yeah

847
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:39,170
yeah cleanliness is like the next

848
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:40,699
important thing we'll talk about

849
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,550
yesterday that's the stainless steel

850
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:45,980
brand not the 250,000 dollar one but

851
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:48,260
well peer pressure has a line out for a

852
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,119
bucket right I'm thinking my eye on the

853
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,680
beer guys you know yeah there's there's

854
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:53,809
a hash maker up north and we're trying

855
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,509
to think of the name earlier what's it

856
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:59,328
so when we were brewing compost tea I

857
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:03,050
called up I think it's like stout tanks

858
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:05,119
which is a like crap beer brewer like

859
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:07,880
they have fermenters yeah things like

860
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,789
that nice and I was like can we get one

861
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:13,190
and then once we get one I want to be

862
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:15,920
like how would we improve this yeah

863
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:18,950
based on this use versus you know I

864
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,539
encourage all those any beer craft like

865
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:22,309
company dude they should definitely step

866
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:24,710
into the hash game cuz they can just do

867
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:27,139
some that there's this guy and I think

868
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,400
he's up and he was in st. Louis and I

869
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:34,068
think he's now up in Washington State

870
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:36,858
but he was a hop brewer heart like like

871

happened is I'm like trying to figure

898
00:38:51,478 --> 00:38:57,658
out why it's off and then I look down

899
00:38:53,039 --> 00:39:04,640
and the power parts aren't touching like

900
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:09,358
the save ones is this a state like a

901
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:10,978
bucket yeah it's like there it is metal

902
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,768
bucket so it's gonna keep everything

903
00:39:10,978 --> 00:39:16,948
like way colder and dialed in terpenes

904
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:18,988

lift it and like you see everything I

910
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:32,579
know so it's on a typical beer or pretty

911
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:35,369
much anymore

912
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:37,289
oh it goes on the bottom and you have

913
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:39,059
one on the side one on the bottom right

914
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:41,579
and kind of do a lot of one we better

915
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:43,949
right Mauritanian and drain down and so

916
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,989
this is a good start you know yeah like

917
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:47,459
you don't have to dump it all over okay

918
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:49,108
have you right they had dip yeah they

919

00:39:51,478 --> 00:39:54,629
comes right down the bottom yeah you

922
00:39:52,978 --> 00:39:56,719
know that's that would be dope yeah he

923
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:59,300
could rinse it all out right

924
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:01,789
okay you know I actually I have a

925
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,710
picture it gets heavy when you're

926
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:06,320

929
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,380
you just break your back for five

930
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:18,140
seconds yeah I mean like I don't know

931
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,840
everyone's I think everyone's different

932
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:23,389
like they're like methods I don't know

933
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:27,650
just like I have a buddy who bags out

934
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:32,089
I'm buddy who has their their work bag

935
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:37,190
like it's actually a 32 gallon uh cooler

936
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:39,440
like I think it's a 32 gallon like bolt

937
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,920
bag set all right do they make up 32

938
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,519
gallon

939
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:46,519
yeah thanks yeah I think it's 3/4 mesh

940
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:51,070
only bag and like he just was set up

941
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:51,070
with the fucking like crane or something

942
00:40:53,019 --> 00:41:07,070
Oh uncle is they on your page yeah yeah

943
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:09,559
nice yeah something that fresh that's

944
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:15,050
what he gallons of that okay a big one

945
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:16,670
that was like at least 100 no I think it

946
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,900
was smaller because we wanted it as

947
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,909
something you can actually go around

948
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,639
with you oh nice so the idea is to do

949
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:25,789
all like small batch brews be like quick

950
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:27,529
I'm gonna go to zone 4 and and you can

951
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:29,929
pull this stainless steel thing behind

952
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:32,480
you and just walk down the road yeah and

953
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:35,319
then that's off just brew another one up

954
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:40,130
for like three zone to zone for sure

955
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:42,110
that's cool yeah yeah they have that's

956
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:46,369
another that's an improvement want to do

957
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:48,590
yeah definitely is yeah step it up I dig

958
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:50,469
it a drain some I put the drains like

959
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:52,820
somewhere in here so at least kink like

960
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:54,259
relieve some of the extra water yeah a

961
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,680
little lighter right right and

962
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,300
Thibodeaux

963
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:59,149
yeah yeah it's gonna save a little bit

964
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:01,370
of back I feel back issues it's easy a

965
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:05,539
little bulkhead fitting right here yeah

966
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:07,819
a simple PVC like little connection to a

967
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:09,130
ball valve and then a little 90 at the

968
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:14,349
end yeah just

969
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:16,869
drain into the bags no totally mods yeah

970
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:22,599
nice that's the next step that's meant

971
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:24,400

dryer is very cool yeah you know and

998
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:29,409
yeah a period it's a good tool to

999
00:43:27,548 --> 00:43:31,088
actually let me hit one lap what should

1000
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:32,828
I yeah dude all right so there's a

1001
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:34,389
strong end of milk yeah I know you just

1002
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:35,920
tried that straw Nina Roz and no I'll

1003
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:38,170
say it in I'll try that cuz this way

1004
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,480
yeah that's the flu I sit here and take

1005
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:43,500
a pick it all in definitely should be

1006
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,500
taken off the banger

1007
00:43:57,909 --> 00:44:03,458
so like that monitor doesn't work so I'm

1008
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:07,929
like is it in focus is it not in focus

1009
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:09,698
like it's the cable or not sorry it's

1010
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:10,899
not the cable because I've replaced like

1011
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:12,369
two cables

1012
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:15,278
there's something about either the

1013
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:16,809
camera the monitor this is showing so

1014
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:18,429
you know I know on that but it's so

1015
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:24,069
small and that Wow

1016
00:44:18,429 --> 00:44:25,838
nice and big got it yeah well you know

1017
00:44:24,068 --> 00:44:29,199
anything about this now kind of takes a

1018
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:33,159
minute to heat up that's all right so

1019
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:34,809
but if you had an email like have you

1020
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:37,268
tried different emails and you're like I

1021
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:39,819
don't like this not really I mean I have

1022
00:44:37,268 --> 00:44:43,058
tried I had a couple and I've owned one

1023
00:44:39,818 --> 00:44:45,909
I do like this more I like the Banger

1024
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:47,499
and like I don't know the details it's

1025
00:44:45,909 --> 00:44:49,478
like a big setup you know it's like I

1026
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:52,118
love it's kind of nice to like have a

1027
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:55,419
little hot banger ready to go I don't

1028
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:57,160
know I'm used to torching for sure so

1029
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,769
you can do it all you have the email

1030
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:03,028
ready to go right you have a custom yeah

1031
00:44:59,768 --> 00:45:05,379
dad right here the torch yeah it's all

1032
00:45:03,028 --> 00:45:06,880
if you wanted to yeah right yeah the

1033
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,818
puff Co it's like what the puffs come I

1034
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,630
feel like the emails like not super like

1035
00:45:09,818 --> 00:45:15,028
I don't know this is so immediate it's

1036
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:17,769
pretty awesome

1037
00:45:15,028 --> 00:45:20,318
if I want that heavy hitting dab and

1038
00:45:17,768 --> 00:45:24,068
this one's like media and of course I'm

1039
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:26,489
super portable yeah oh yeah this one is

1040
00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:32,440
the least practical this is like the the

1041
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:34,179
party that was very fun though I wish we

1042
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,849
had some tongs to like head towards

1043
00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:38,588
those coals a Potter yeah yeah so it's

1044
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:44,079
like you do these things that I'm like I

1045
00:45:38,588 --> 00:45:47,949
need like a plate to put charcoal on my

1046
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:52,028
tongs for charcoal so you still got a

1047
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:54,039
minute here got like 140 I would say so

1048
00:45:52,028 --> 00:45:56,920
but basically the glass can only get up

1049
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:58,809
to a certain temperature um yeah I think

1050
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,608
it like once I'm torching it so it's

1051
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:02,319
getting pretty like glowing rather than

1052
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:04,298
just Peaks so as soon as you let go

1053
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:06,849
that's the point from that temperature

1054
00:46:04,298 --> 00:46:08,619
that's right that's when I know it's a

1055
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:10,380
stoppage we get when you're in like

1056
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:12,600
different like if you were

1057
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,579
environment Montreal right and like the

1058
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:16,380
middle of yeah I'm tweaking it right now

1059
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:18,599
actually it's kind of chilly in here

1060
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,160
so I would be going like five seconds

1061
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:24,989
later if I was like in my warm room

1062
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:28,159
davits there's a little bit of air like

1063
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:31,289
it's kind of hard to oh yeah yeah

1064
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:33,029
brought me my my igloo I like that it

1065
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:35,909
seems like you spend a lot of time

1066
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:40,769
iteratively improving the art of the

1067
00:46:35,909 --> 00:46:48,029
PERT your personal dad's really organic

1068
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:51,179
weed yeah that's why we grow to enjoy

1069
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:54,450
the act of smoking like the whole reason

1070
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:56,579
why I started like growing in smoking

1071
00:46:54,449 --> 00:46:59,969
hash and and trying to make my own

1072
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:02,099
hashes cuz like I love it and like I

1073
00:46:59,969 --> 00:47:05,969
want to have my own to smoke and like oh

1074
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:09,119
yeah just becoming a like better farmer

1075
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:10,649
just like sometimes housing like creates

1076
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,139
opportunity with like having excess

1077
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:15,690
amounts of resin to like start a little

1078
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:17,460
thing with experiment you want to grow

1079
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:19,200
this tangi that no one else really wants

1080
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:24,690
to grow because it isn't you much yeah

1081
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:27,929
you can yeah I love what you have to do

1082
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:28,380
at scale nice it's like all about the

1083
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:32,429
bottom line

1084
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:35,970
yeah exactly have that pressure no

1085
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:37,679
exactly that's so true it's like if it's

1086
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:39,719
a loss it's like oh whatever I'll just

1087
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,639
smoke this you know but to his point you

1088
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:43,829
can go after like super low yielding

1089
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:48,329
stuff that tastes amazing yeah

1090
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:50,099
turning alright exactly yeah like you're

1091
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:54,210
like a pro surfer who travels the world

1092
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:56,339
like with the known storms like I didn't

1093
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:58,860
Panama next that's what I'm gonna set

1094
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,539
that or Australia yeah I like

1095
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:02,700
matchmaking so much cuz you can work

1096
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:05,009
with you saw some few farmers you know I

1097
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:07,049
enjoy doing that cuz I work a few like a

1098
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:09,210
handful of farmers like I need no new

1099
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:11,400
farmers and that's the thing new farmers

1100
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:12,840
is always you know everyone can like and

1101
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,360
growing your own is even better yeah

1102
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,309
like not everyone can be doing it's a

1103
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,890
single source thing like like that with

1104
00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:19,869
you

1105
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:22,659
I would love to watch them in that yeah

1106
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:27,279
you but nice try somebody so many things

1107
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:29,049
man yeah yeah but it's true like not

1108
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,820
everyone can do it like a single source

1109
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,980
like there's growers that have to be in

1110
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,330
the garden 24/7 and like there's how

1111
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,219
Snickers that need to be making house

1112
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:37,389
24/7 because there's just that's what

1113
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:38,799
they're good at and that's what the

1114
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:41,769
growers are gonna have like not every

1115
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:45,940
grower can like has you know I'm like

1116
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:49,989
you're like like to sport for like bo

1117
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:52,690
Jackson and I'm crushing that and I'm

1118
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:54,339
extracting and I'm crushing right but my

1119
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,769
garden was ten times the size I couldn't

1120
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:58,960
be made a - you know like it just has to

1121
00:48:56,769 --> 00:49:01,119
be scaled small to be able to do that

1122
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,639
single source thing which this is why

1123
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,259
people like that education needs to be

1124
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:09,039
out there and people do appreciate it

1125
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:12,100
but like yeah some people don't know

1126
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:13,539
what it means people see the flower on

1127
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:17,619
the shelf in a box and they're yeah I

1128
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:20,769
don't know yeah so the next time you

1129
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:22,359
harvest save like a cola of flour yeah

1130
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:24,480
for sure I think I'm gonna dry some on

1131
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:29,500
this winter best I have come in here

1132
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:40,150
yeah hopefully a bigger version of this

1133
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:44,099
table this is a nice table dude yeah

1134
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:44,099
yeah so you could put that one under

1135
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:55,720
like when someone tries to pull the no

1136
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:58,150
no you you try to pull the tablecloth

1137
00:49:55,719 --> 00:50:03,879
out and not have anything fall off

1138
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:06,579
oh it's like trying to do that all right

1139
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,550
well I'm super high banana the thing

1140
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:15,219
that was a good a good what banana right

1141
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:19,330
yeah straw Nana yeah so how many

1142
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:21,029
different ones are there Oh like four

1143
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:24,730
five

1144
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:27,450
GMO cream de GMO

1145
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:29,679
I'm sorry the different consistencies

1146
00:50:27,449 --> 00:50:30,539
yeah I think it'd be cool to walk

1147
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:32,969
through how you

1148
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:35,639
to each one it's for sure some kind of

1149
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:37,739
has come out a consistency easily yeah

1150
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:42,900
and some you can mean all you can

1151
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:45,349
manipulate right right like I think it's

1152
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:48,150
like from for me whether I'm gonna like

1153
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:51,750
manipulate it or not like into a

1154
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:54,840
consistency just depends on like how it

1155
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:58,139
tastes is fresh pressed like recently

1156
00:50:54,840 --> 00:51:00,090
like I mean also there's trends like of

1157
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:02,879
like two months ago I everyone was like

1158
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:04,440
cold cure batter all I want is cold like

1159
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,030
everyone was so hyped down cold care if

1160
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,150
you made cold care I was like you know

1161
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:11,220
it's like the hype thing to do but fresh

1162
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,990
press is always awesome like I feel like

1163
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:13,919
people are always stoked on fresh press

1164
00:51:12,989 --> 00:51:18,149
so that's what I've been kind of like

1165
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:19,860
leaning towards and if it's but for like

1166
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,420
it just depends like sometimes the

1167
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:23,730
French press won't taste as good I was

1168
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:27,119
like a cold cure so like I found though

1169
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:35,010
that was the idea of giving someone

1170
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:37,980
fresh press and say hey you leave in

1171
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:39,780
your pocket yeah like I brought it 3/4

1172
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,820
of the way and you can bring it in any

1173
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:45,360
dress and you want right it's kind of

1174
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:47,550
just like the like the grower or me a

1175
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,599
flower and I'll make it into this and I

1176
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:50,160
could get it back to him but right now

1177
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:52,650
you can make it to what you want more

1178
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:55,679
totally it's like getting semi prepared

1179
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:58,349
meals at home yeah and like to make that

1180
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:01,469
let's do it yeah to make the batter like

1181
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:03,809
it's just like I'll just leave it at

1182
00:52:01,469 --> 00:52:05,879
room temp or I'll put it in a slightly

1183
00:52:03,809 --> 00:52:08,699
warmer environment for like a couple

1184
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:11,300
days and everything will just you know

1185
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:14,309
change into like a wet batter or like a

1186
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:16,230
you know the Terps will go to the top

1187
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:18,059
layer yeah you see that separation

1188
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:20,130
d'herblay yeah and then right when you

1189
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:21,179
when you mix that up it just becomes

1190
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:23,579
that like that better

1191
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:25,919
yeah so that's that's how the cold cure

1192
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:28,679
goes ill only do that that and then I'll

1193
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,000
do like the fresh press I like if it

1194
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:31,469
tastes good as fresh press I'll

1195
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,900
definitely be dose fresh press and gram

1196
00:52:31,469 --> 00:52:37,519
it all out individually like baller jars

1197
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,519
are sick people like them but like

1198
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,059
like I don't know gram that's just like

1199
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,800
you can proportion your smoke up better

1200
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:48,449
I was only dabbing I was like making

1201
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,280
myself these big baller jars and like I

1202
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:51,719
was smoking so much more just because I

1203
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,700
was like taking these big dabs out of

1204
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:55,859
the jar and right now I grandma all out

1205
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:58,289
and it's like I feel like I'm like dude

1206
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:00,960
I'm taking that normal size dabs I'm not

1207
00:52:58,289 --> 00:53:03,719
like wasting anything and like it's it's

1208
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,400
better you know I find that to having

1209
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:07,309
this a little jar for your personal yeah

1210
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,260
breathe through it easily just take

1211
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:12,269
right right it's good you enjoy it's

1212
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:17,240
good you enjoy about like you can still

1213
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:20,489
enjoy all the mini grams you know yeah

1214
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:22,500
so I guess you don't have a favorite

1215
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:26,219
consistency really yeah either you know

1216
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:29,070
yeah for sure I don't know yeah I guess

1217
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:31,679
it just depends definitely probably more

1218
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:33,240
wet batter I guess yeah if I had to pick

1219
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,819
I'd probably go with the wet batter cuz

1220
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:38,129
it stays as a wet batter or like the

1221
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:40,289
fresh press sometimes the grams you

1222
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:43,289
leave it out for a day and it like goes

1223
00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:46,019
to this like dry butter and it's like

1224
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:47,880
cool but it's like I'd rather have a wet

1225
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:51,570
butter than like a dry butter oh you

1226
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:53,849
know yeah so with the with the cold care

1227
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:55,680
well you can whip it up like it just

1228
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:57,839
it's all preference for sure I'll

1229
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:59,849
usually smoke it before it has the

1230
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:03,480
opportunity to like butter out anyway

1231
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:08,369
right the last I want to give the cold

1232
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:11,610
cures yeah cool all right so we hit

1233
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:15,059
everything definitely hit a lot we

1234
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:21,450
finished the race nice oh yeah we tried

1235

1265
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:56,199
few but one guy my kind of go to he has

1266

a very good green thumb he has he kind

1267
00:55:56,199 --> 00:55:59,259
of has that feel for the plan he

1268
00:55:57,789 --> 00:56:01,929
basically thought is with the plant you

1269
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,950
know so I like he's going for best

1270
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:04,869
people to work with

1271
00:56:02,949 --> 00:56:08,049

bar me

1301
00:57:09,289 --> 00:57:18,139
I used to strain and then I hear people

1302
00:57:10,849 --> 00:57:22,699
using cold yeah but strand it's funny

1303
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:25,210
out there yeah and my genetics just let

1304
00:57:22,699 --> 00:57:27,529
it I have just limiting down to four I'm

1305

1307
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:38,359
and then cookies and cream and then I'm

1308
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:40,220
using cream this is what I'm seeing a

1309
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,530
lot more - yeah that's like my favorites

1310
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:44,509
Mike my favorite strain to dab like the

1311
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:48,820
creamy Turks like the best

1312
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:51,830
anything the the pheno I have did we

1313
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:57,380
know when we hit the cream it's so good

1314
00:57:51,829 --> 00:58:00,469
at the cream get to the studio oh yeah

1315
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:02,030
yeah that's cookies and cream mix but I

1316
00:58:00,469 --> 00:58:03,799
don't have any straight cookies and

1317
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:06,830

that's neutral I know remaining lineup

1320
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:14,150
yeah yeah I think like it'll be I'm

1321
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:17,000
gonna run it like a lot in 2020 cuz it's

1322
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:20,059
like a good one another strain coming to

1323
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,369
my mind is that tangi the it's purple

1324

the longest but it's not it has not been

1333
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:50,119
like well-maintained it looks good who

1334
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:52,130
is such a weird consistency yeah I know

1335
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:56,329
it's messed up Morgan yeah check it out

1336

1338
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:05,050

1339
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:08,890
man nice yeah it smells great it all

1340
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:12,100
reminds me it reminds me of this lake

1341
00:59:08,889 --> 00:59:14,440
forbidden fruit kinda that I washed like

1342
00:59:12,099 --> 00:59:15,759
heard that I grew for my first ever one

1343
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,300
of my first ever plants oh that girl

1344
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:21,490
like a long time ago this uh smells good

1345
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:24,670
so when I first started pressing it was

1346
00:59:21,489 --> 00:59:28,239
mostly flower you know yeah and and like

1347
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:30,250
the dosey doe press like good yield yeah

1348
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:32,109
I owe the og KB did good yield slurry

1349
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:34,210
came did a good yield this one didn't

1350
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:37,539
get good yield but it was just like the

1351
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:40,119
most overpowering like flavor right yeah

1352
00:59:37,539 --> 00:59:41,949
that's usually how it goes he's seeing

1353
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:45,159
how that is you know it just makes sense

1354
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:46,859
now knowing what I know now but still

1355
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:49,409
it's like so it's so worth it even

1356
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:54,640
mixing it having a little bit of this

1357
00:59:49,409 --> 00:59:56,559
adding to like you know your DM oh he's

1358
00:59:54,639 --> 01:00:00,429
mixing the chirps it's pretty

1359
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:03,099
interesting yeah that's nice I'm at

1360
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:04,719
antitrypsin so long so it's really yes

1361
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:07,750
hope he keeps that he's kept it for a

1362
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:10,449
long time like this that's someone and I

1363
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:12,909
begged compound etics ice cream man has

1364
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:15,069
a similar profile nice you know but I

1365
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:17,559
think he already has a really good yeah

1366
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:22,150
I know for his TNG see what he does he's

1367
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:24,880
a mastermind oh yeah we're talking about

1368
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:27,190
like the drying method you know or no

1369
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,780
gain the water out quicker and how it

1370
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:31,570
like for the freeze oh yeah yeah yeah

1371
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:33,310
that huge of a deal yeah with my method

1372
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:36,010
it's like a big Emporium

1373
01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:38,170
yeah yeah for sure dude and like member

1374
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:42,310
greet up the bags together for the full

1375
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:45,460
the full mesh bags so like these five

1376
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:49,000
gallon bags you've seen these this isn't

1377
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:50,409
full mesh but for my method when you dry

1378
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,059
it when you try get the water out

1379
01:00:50,409 --> 01:00:54,809
quicker the full mesh is way better

1380
01:00:52,059 --> 01:00:57,639
right because I'm dumping all this

1381
01:00:54,809 --> 01:00:59,380
through the small bags you know yeah

1382
01:00:57,639 --> 01:01:01,960
is that kind of how you do it are you

1383
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:04,660
watching the 220 yeah yeah and then I

1384
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:08,320
have so washed to tow you use all three

1385
01:01:04,659 --> 01:01:10,089
20 gallon bags right um yeah yes all my

1386
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:12,080
other bags it's like they're 20 gallons

1387
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:18,630
again yeah yeah

1388
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:20,880
yeah I don't know tens yeah I was kind

1389
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:24,720
of wanting to do the tens well like I

1390
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,760
was just I just like the he's a lot like

1391
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:29,069
you were saying trying out easy because

1392
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,050
the base is bigger right yeah you just

1393
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:32,640
give it a shake lady gets the water out

1394
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:34,440
faster yeah for sure

1395
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:36,420
it's like everything drink like when you

1396
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,820
when you have a five gallon like I don't

1397
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:41,159
you run the water through and like if

1398
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:43,650
there's a bunch of hash not the five

1399
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:45,750
gallon but like five gallons are great

1400
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:47,099
but like what if I was doing like 4,000

1401
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:49,349
grams or five thousand grams like fresh

1402
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:51,739
frozen like it might take a minute for

1403
01:01:49,349 --> 01:01:54,960
the forty gallon to like dry you know

1404
01:01:51,739 --> 01:01:57,149
get out all there right now dry fuck the

1405
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,760
water at doubters got me for the fucking

1406
01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:01,950
water to drain through so like I don't

1407
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,990
like like having the full small bag of

1408
01:02:01,949 --> 01:02:05,429
water like waiting for it to drain with

1409
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:07,049
the width of 20 is like I'm just like

1410
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:08,789
give it a shake and the water goes right

1411
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:11,760
through and stuff for sure but I don't

1412
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:13,920
know just like I can't wait this because

1413
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:17,430
I'm gonna definitely upgrade these to

1414
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,789
the full mesh and yeah because that does

1415
01:02:17,429 --> 01:02:20,210
help

1416
01:02:17,789 --> 01:02:23,579
Plus cuz I ain't saying on the sides too

1417
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:26,490
yeah yeah whole bag is more surface area

1418
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:28,039
of mesh yeah so the water will go right

1419
01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:32,399
through it like way quicker

1420
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:34,739
cuz I'll wash it through here and then

1421
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,369
I'm like dumping it basically through

1422
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:40,109
something like this the bags here I'm

1423
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:42,509
dumping this whole thing you know

1424
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:44,910
through that bag yeah and then I have to

1425
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:46,470
set it down and wait for the bag it gets

1426
01:02:44,909 --> 01:02:49,259
too full sometimes it starts to sink in

1427
01:02:46,469 --> 01:02:51,599
right right exactly and the lid yeah so

1428
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:54,600
full mesh it won't have that issue you

1429
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:57,059
know get the water out quicker and then

1430
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:58,860
hopefully yeah that's about it well is

1431
01:02:57,059 --> 01:03:01,349
that what the bolt bags are I think they

1432
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:03,269
are the I think yeah there man yeah

1433
01:03:01,349 --> 01:03:08,839
that's what I use to the bolt bags like

1434
01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:13,349
here's a twenty gallon sixty right get

1435
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:15,720
160 yeah yes I only use I bought the

1436
01:03:13,349 --> 01:03:18,000
three bags set yeah but I find myself

1437
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:20,309
now I'm all using the 220 you know

1438
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,340
no washing in this and I'm still using

1439
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:26,099
my first back said that I got the bubble

1440
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:27,780
magic off of Amazon nice you know so

1441
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:30,380
your first like my first tester said

1442
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:33,540
yeah and you know what's super funny I

1443
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:35,700
was washing with the bags like this for

1444
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:40,019
the longest time so the threading is all

1445
01:03:35,699 --> 01:03:43,730
in here and then was it man another hash

1446
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:45,989
companies like yo the bags inside out I

1447
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:48,449
for the longest time that I turn them

1448
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:51,449
inside out like yes oh no cuz I would

1449
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:53,789
use this sprayer to get into all these

1450
01:03:51,449 --> 01:03:57,750
crevices to get the hash that would get

1451
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:59,550
caught because it kept ya know here we

1452
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:01,980
go yeah hag mouths a house key caught up

1453
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:08,849
here and I'd be like man it's gotta be a

1454
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:12,090
better way so we help each other out you

1455
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:13,920
know that's why I believe that so like

1456
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:16,260
once I turned it inside out my life had

1457
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:20,369
a lot easier it drains do a lot quicker

1458
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:23,520
you know and it's so funny now yeah yeah

1459
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:25,890
you have to like pour it through that

1460
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:26,909
way attention to detail it's very

1461
01:04:25,889 --> 01:04:28,289
interesting you know you don't know

1462
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:30,690
these bags don't come with instructions

1463
01:04:28,289 --> 01:04:33,949
yeah I dude it doesn't stay eternity

1464
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:36,809
okay new hash maker like putting like

1465
01:04:33,949 --> 01:04:38,460
their like their I don't know like doing

1466
01:04:36,809 --> 01:04:39,869
their bags office oh we're like stocking

1467
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:42,329
their bags the wrong way or something

1468
01:04:39,869 --> 01:04:45,990
exactly and they don't know like it just

1469
01:04:42,329 --> 01:04:48,539
it's really important to people doing it

1470
01:04:45,989 --> 01:04:50,429
it's like it's important to like I mean

1471
01:04:48,539 --> 01:04:52,440
you're gonna take losses with learning

1472
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:54,149
anything but wait it's kind of attention

1473
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:56,010
to details like the main thing with

1474
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:57,838
making hash it's like you're gonna know

1475
01:04:56,010 --> 01:05:00,170
and understand what's going on and

1476
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:01,650
you'll fucking be a good hash maker yeah

1477
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:03,380
exactly

1478
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:08,838
I think about if we're gonna start this

1479
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:11,579
anything this is a lot of work yeah yeah

1480
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:14,250
it's like yeah I mean I start up here

1481
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:15,719
but after like mid run you know I have

1482
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:17,909
to you know I'm bringing it down let me

1483
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:19,799
see the paddle nothing like that feeling

1484
01:05:17,909 --> 01:05:21,719
at the end of a good wash when you just

1485
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:23,580
like tired and you just did a great wash

1486
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:25,529
it's like a sport I'm not drying you're

1487
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:27,179
like so stoked you're just like ah I

1488
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:28,920
played sports and it sound like it's

1489
01:05:27,179 --> 01:05:30,419
kind of sporty you know you see these is

1490
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,460
going tackle it and get in

1491
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:36,088
it's systematic you know you have a game

1492
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:38,429
plan yeah actually cute my game plan

1493
01:05:36,088 --> 01:05:40,318
well today for sure I sit down outdoors

1494
01:05:38,429 --> 01:05:42,058
and take a DAB my think how long do you

1495
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:43,230
want where could I improve

1496
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:44,609
I've been time I've been trying to time

1497
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:46,858
it more now yeah

1498
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:48,900
various for me some IP seven washes this

1499
01:05:46,858 --> 01:05:52,078
last wash because it kept on coming

1500
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:54,240
yeah no how long do you do each wash no

1501
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:57,539
more than ten minutes okay you know at

1502
01:05:54,239 --> 01:06:00,538
least five minutes yeah you know yo yeah

1503
01:05:57,539 --> 01:06:03,000
mine are about seven to 15 minutes okay

1504
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:04,829
I'm gone but I only do about five washes

1505
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,949
depending because then I think the fresh

1506
01:06:04,829 --> 01:06:09,930
frozen like comes off I don't know

1507
01:06:07,949 --> 01:06:12,480
quicker maybe or like it stops dumping

1508
01:06:09,929 --> 01:06:14,548
quicker because maybe though it doesn't

1509
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:18,000
yield as good as drive or doesn't yield

1510
01:06:14,548 --> 01:06:18,538
as like throughout do you know what I

1511
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,429
mean

1512
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:23,010
I don't know like all comes off at once

1513
01:06:20,429 --> 01:06:26,518
instead of like coming off and I can be

1514
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:28,890
faster with the fresh road yeah yeah so

1515
01:06:26,518 --> 01:06:31,318
yes it's an interesting I just dumped

1516
01:06:28,889 --> 01:06:33,480
all all the trim in there I put a little

1517
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:37,079
bit of ice and water in the bottom you

1518
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:39,298
call a trim all the ice yeah yeah I've

1519
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:40,680
layered it before you know I find just

1520
01:06:39,298 --> 01:06:42,690
now like having a little bit at the

1521
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:45,179
bottom with ice and water and then all

1522
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:46,798
the products and then doing it with ice

1523
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:49,108
and letting it soak I gave like a

1524
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,849
20-minute soak nice nice cuz someone

1525
01:06:49,108 --> 01:06:53,219
explained to me I asked I'm like me and

1526
01:06:50,849 --> 01:06:57,650
you break up the nugs you know yeah this

1527
01:06:53,219 --> 01:07:00,389
is this paddle is from the local brewery

site like I'd love to sit down with them

1533
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:11,519
and be like this is this is the perfect

1534
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:13,679
size for this person this thing will be

1535
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:16,139
like gets so cold when you're washing

1536
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:18,268
I'm sure do you work not it's pretty

1537
01:07:16,139 --> 01:07:20,009
thick this whole thing's solid yeah it

1538
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:21,449
did my hands will get cold really nice

1539
01:07:20,009 --> 01:07:25,170
my I was using one of these the other

1540
01:07:21,449 --> 01:07:28,768
day helping helping ogre washing like I

1541
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:30,990
was freezing with well I'm sure that one

1542
01:07:28,768 --> 01:07:33,838
glove my glove broke how cool the rooms

1543
01:07:30,989 --> 01:07:36,358
like what 40 degrees product yeah I was

1544
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:38,278
like 60 degrees so yeah yeah I gotta get

1545
01:07:36,358 --> 01:07:41,219
a cool but there's another upgrade easy

1546
01:07:38,278 --> 01:07:43,108
so pretty pretty pretty cool my doesn't

1547
01:07:41,219 --> 01:07:47,718
get like mine my room gets it

1548
01:07:43,108 --> 01:07:51,239
like 45 to 55 depending on like nice the

1549
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:53,068
how cold it is outside by like kind of

1550
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:54,749
hung up on the temperature of the room

1551
01:07:53,068 --> 01:07:58,920
like I feel like if I get it down to 40

1552
01:07:54,748 --> 01:08:02,548
I'll get better yields I don't know I

1553
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:03,719
don't know like when I I washed GMO the

1554
01:08:02,548 --> 01:08:05,699
first time I ever watched fresh frozen

1555
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:08,670
Gmail I literally wash it in a 65 degree

1556
01:08:05,699 --> 01:08:11,129
environment fresh frozen got great

1557
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:13,139
yields and like the only thing I feel

1558
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:15,088
like the cool the main thing I like

1559
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:17,278
about being washing in like a super cold

1560
01:08:15,088 --> 01:08:18,838
environment is like you're scooping the

1561
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,339
hash and like yeah that don't have to

1562
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:22,679
worry about it reducing up on the bags

1563
01:08:20,338 --> 01:08:25,198
real quick it's just like but like the

1564
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:27,420
GMO didn't grease at all in that 65

1565
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:29,278
degree and then I washed chem dog in

1566
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:31,259
that same environment it was like hell

1567
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:33,420
it was like greasy is gonna sing off

1568
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:33,838
like right away I was like fuck this

1569
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,399
sucks

1570
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:38,039
and then like that's when you got a

1571
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:40,738
freezin and yeah there's like I beat you

1572
01:08:38,039 --> 01:08:43,798
so quick like they would like my smooth

1573
01:08:40,738 --> 01:08:46,259
ankle covered in hash yeah I mean I

1574
01:08:43,798 --> 01:08:49,048
still I had the freeze dryer still so I

1575
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:51,779
got it like just right on the trays but

1576
01:08:49,048 --> 01:08:55,588
so like when it's all greased up on the

1577
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:58,020
bag do you uh I you know I spray it off

1578
01:08:55,588 --> 01:09:00,028
you know yeah like I would be like like

1579
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:01,920
literally so so greasy that I would

1580
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:04,290
spray and nothing on it it would just be

1581
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,960
like like that's the greasy stuff it's

1582
01:09:04,289 --> 01:09:09,599
so rare by like like the strontium I

1583
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,399
don't my Wi-Fi those are like a breeze

1584
01:09:09,599 --> 01:09:14,190
it just like comes off so it's like such

1585
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:17,009
a stable easy to work with resin those

1586
01:09:14,189 --> 01:09:19,108
are the ones to the sprayers keep pretty

1587
01:09:17,009 --> 01:09:22,048
important yeah when you're collecting it

1588
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:24,359
right oh yes I use we're talking about

1589
01:09:22,048 --> 01:09:27,259
filled with soil this is this came from

1590
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:30,270
him nice yeah from Jeremy Chaffin yeah

1591
01:09:27,259 --> 01:09:33,020
so using that filling with ice and water

1592
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:36,540
good pressure and it gives you a nice a

1593
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:37,920
nice spray I wish you were shorter I'm

1594
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:39,359
sure they have like shorter ones you

1595
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,440
know yeah yeah that's I can get like

1596
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:42,440
closer because I have like
