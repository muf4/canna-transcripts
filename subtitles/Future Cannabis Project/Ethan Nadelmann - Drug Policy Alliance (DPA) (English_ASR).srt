1
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:19,600
I want to introduce someone who really

2
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:22,960
doesn't need a lot of introduction in

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:27,840
this crowd. Um, but I'll just do that

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:31,599
for a moment anyway. Um he is called by

5
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:34,960
the Rolling Stones the real drugs are

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,399
the point man for drug policy reform in

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,280
this country and increasingly

8
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,920
nationally. Formerly a professor at

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,640
Princeton 25 years ago he started to

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,760
really get involved in drug policy and

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,799
over 20 years ago he started what is now

12
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,799
the Drug Policy Alliance.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,960
and and he's been here since the

14
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,600
beginning. You know, I'm new to some of

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,040
you. I've been with DPA for five years,

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,359
but Ethan goes all the way back to Prop

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,600
215 and before, and he's been here and

18
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,840
kept a large presence in California for

19
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:17,798
over 20 years.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:22,799
And I'm so honored and touched to

21
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:25,439
introduce my boss, my director, really a

22
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,439
drug policy reform warrior, Ethan

23
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,438
Natleman.

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,759
Okay. Thank you very much, Lynn. That

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,079
was wonderful. and Liz's been doing an

26
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,438
amazing job as heading up DPA's effort

27
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,438
in uh in California on this, not just on

28
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,599
marijuana, but other things as well. So,

29
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,039
before I get going, and I should say I

30
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,719
if somebody here wants to give me a

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,799
fivem minute warning because there's no

32
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,319
clocks and I don't have a watch, so it

33
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,720
could be like running into the debates

34
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,519
before I finish here. But let me ask

35
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,399
you, how many of you have heard of Prop

36
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:05,359
19? Raise your hand. How many you don't

37
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,519
know what Prop 19 is? Raise your hand.

38
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,439
Okay, you see all that about 25% of

39
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,400
hands. How many of you know what Prop

40
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,239
215 is? Raise your hand. How many of you

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,159
don't know what Prop 215 is? Raise your

42
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:21,120
hands. Okay, just so you know, 215 was

43
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:25,039
the medical marijuana initiative in 1996

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,439
in California. And I apologize uh

45
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:33,280
because I realize in talking with you

46
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:35,039
here, you ain't a movement audience.

47
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,120
Most of you are people in the

48
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,400
money-making side of this, right? And

49
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,640
so, you know, part of why I'm up here is

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,519
that I want to be able to talk to you

51
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:49,119
not as just maybe fellow

52
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:51,519
stoners and not just talk to you as

53
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,200
people looking to make money in this new

54
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,120
and emerging and booming green rush of a

55
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,199
legal market.

56
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,439
But I'm hoping that I can be talking to

57
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:05,560
you so that when I say to you fellow

58
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:10,280
drug policy

59
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:13,840
reformers, you think that's me. That's

60
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,840
you. Okay? And let me say why this is

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,080
important. The reason

62
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,239
why the reason

63
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,400
why these opportunities exist today, the

64
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,400
reason why you're here, the reason why

65
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,640
there's a legal marijuana industry for

66
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,239
medical and hopefully for non-medical

67
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,719
beginning after election day, the reason

68
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,280
why this is happening around the

69
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:38,000
country, that none of this

70
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,759
transformation was driven by people who

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,199
wanted to make money in this industry

72
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,199
trying to change the law so they can

73
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,759
make money legally, right? None of it

74
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,598
was driven that way. Okay, understand.

75
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,359
And also, by the way, this didn't emerge

76
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:53,359
also because of some new uh invention,

77
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,040
some new tech thing that just popped up

78
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,599
and all of a sudden we got this thing.

79
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:00,000
It's not like that, right? This

80
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:03,598
movement, your opportunities exist here

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,759
today. The reason you are here today is

82
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,238
because a small number of people like

83
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,759
me, like Rob Campy, Marijuana Policy

84
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,039
Project, like our friends at Normal,

85
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,159
like Graham Boyd, and a few

86
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:18,798
others, and the people we work

87
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:23,439
with went out there beginning over 20

88
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:25,918
years ago to raise money from rich guys

89
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,839
who had no financial interest in this

90
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,439
area. We're not making money in it

91
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,079
illegally. had no hopes to make money

92
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,639
illegally, but who became engaged in

93
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,918
trying to end marijuana prohibition

94
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,079
because of the feeling that marijuana

95
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:42,639
prohibition was a monumental disaster

96
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,918
for this country and for this world. And

97
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,280
that arresting, right, you know,

98
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:51,120
arresting 700,000 people a year, right,

99
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,719
putting tens of millions of dollars into

100
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,399
the hands of gangsters on this side of

101
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,080
the border and across and

102
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,918
internationally, right? that that that

103
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,680
that doing things like ripping people's

104
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,039
property because of acid forfeite laws

105
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,400
and taking their property away because

106
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,400
they found a little weed or some money

107
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,560
they thought was for weed that that

108
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,159
dragging women through the through the

109
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,759
child custody courts because they tested

110
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,840
positive for we when they gave birth or

111
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,400
when they had a little baby with no no

112
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,319
indication of harm to a child right that

113
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,799
drug testing people in American society

114
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,478
and saying you can't hold a job simply

115
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,000
because you like to smoke weed not on

116
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,560
the job but the night before the weekend

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,160
before that all of this was a disaster

118
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,879
right and that it should not be allowed

119
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,320
to continue. And more than that, more

120
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,000
than that, it wasn't just about

121
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,519
marijuana for most of the people I'm

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
talking about, right? You know, if you

123
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,959
the guys, you look at the guys who put

124
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,879
the money up early on. I mean, George

125
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,879
Soros, and who's still putting it up,

126
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,159
you know, Peter Lewis, John Sperling,

127
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,600
somebody said George Zimmer, George

128
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,199
Zimmer is a men's warehouse guy. John

129
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,479
Sperling's University of Phoenix. Peter

130
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,160
Lewis, progressive insurance. George

131
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,639
Soros, famous philanthropist and

132
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,759
financial investor, and a range of

133
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,280
others. None of them were getting into

134
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,639
it just so that they could get high.

135
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,879
Some of them like to get high. someone

136
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,240
didn't give a damn about it. It was the

137
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,719
notion that not just the war on

138
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,918
marijuana and marijuana users was

139
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,919
problematic, but that the entire drug

140
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:11,198
war was fundamentally wrong. Right. And

141
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:13,359
right and and what it meant was that

142
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,360
even though we understood and most of us

143
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,639
understood that the answers with cocaine

144
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,479
and hero methamphetamine and

145
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,600
psychedelics, etc., etc., was not

146
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,038
necessarily going to be the same as

147
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,039
marijuana, we weren't going to be

148
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,800
looking to make an alcohol-like model

149
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,318
for these drugs. I mean some people feel

150
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,600
that way and all of us think that maybe

151
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,600
that's the way it should be on some days

152
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,439
but by and large that was not the idea

153
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,039
but it was the idea that this

154
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,639
prohibitionist war on drugs right was

155
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,038
not just about marijuana but everything

156
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,360
else just the wrong thing for this

157
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,918
country in the world that taking America

158
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,160
from 50,000 people behind bars in 1989

159
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,240
drug charge to half a million as of a

160
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,319
few years ago that putting more people

161
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,319
in the United States behind bars on a

162
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,560
drug charge than all of Western Europe

163
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,400
put behind bars for everything and they

164
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,240
have 100 million more people than we do.

165
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,719
They're driving America's incarceration

166
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,639
rate up to the highest in the world,

167
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,680
more than the Russians, more than the

168
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,840
Chinese, more than anybody, the highest

169
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,038
incarceration rate in the history of

170
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,198
democratic societies. America today with

171
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,360
barely 4% of the world's population but

172
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,280
over 20% of the world's incarcerated

173
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,639
population and that increase driven

174
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,879
overwhelmingly in the 80s and 90s and

175
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,680
early 2000s by the war on drugs that

176
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,560
that had to end. So why is marijuana so

177
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,800
pivotal in all this? There's a few

178
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,598
reasons, right? The first reason, the

179
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,560
first

180
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:39,560
reason is that the area where we could

181
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,918
accomplish the greatest reform was on

182
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,839
marijuana, right? We could take

183
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,918
marijuana unlike the other drugs where

184
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,279
we have to talk about decriminalizing,

185
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,359
rolling back mandatory minimum

186
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,519
sentences, having a less harsh drug war,

187
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,479
a kinder a kindergler drug war, learning

188
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,918
from the Europeans, etc. But with

189
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,639
marijuana, we could actually take this

190
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:01,680
thing out of the prohibition system,

191
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,918
right? And it's why in 1996 when we did

192
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,199
the first Prop 2 Prop 215, the medical

193
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,799
marijuana initiative, the other

194
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,319
initiative we did was a treatment

195
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
instead of incarceration initiative for

196
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,520
people struggling with drug addiction.

197
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,279
Right? Those were issues where we saw

198
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,038
that a majority of Americans who had

199
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,359
been, you know, seized by the drug war

200
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:20,159
of the late 80s and all the hysteria

201
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,038
could say, "Wait a second. We can see

202
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,800
it's gone too far when it comes to

203
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,639
throwing people in jail who seriously

204
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,478
have a drug addiction and aren't hurting

205
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,280
other people. And we can see it's gone

206
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,199
too far when we're telling sick people

207
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,838
that if they want to use this medicine,

208
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,240
they're a criminal. Right? That's where

209
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,880
this stuff came from. So please

210
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,719
understand that you know that as we're

211
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,039
moving and as we're making moving this

212
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,278
market in this incredibly awkward way

213
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,759
and difficult challenging way from an

214
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,000
illegal market to a legal market

215
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,319
understand the origins of where your

216
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,240
opportunities emerge from. Understand

217
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,080
that you can all make money in this

218
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,320
stuff without having had to invest a

219
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,120
penny in changing the laws to get where

220
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,800
we are today. Understand also that we're

221
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,720
standing on the shoulders of pioneers

222
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,479
who led this stuff before. I remember

223
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,399
back 20 years ago when this local

224
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,800
activist on HIV and marijuana, Dennis

225
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,440
Peron in San Francisco, you know, and

226
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,519
basically if Dennis had not gotten that

227
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,680
thing going, drafting 215, for all I

228
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,879
know, on the back of a napkin, I would

229
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,159
not have come in then and raised the

230
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,838
money from the big guys and get this

231
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,919
thing and ch make California the first

232
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,320
state in America to legalize medical

233
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,240
marijuana, right? going back six years

234
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
ago to Richard Lee. I mean, Richard

235
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,440
Lee's hutzbah with getting out there and

236
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,160
saying, "I'm going to try to legalize

237
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,519
marijuana in 2010 and I and Rob Campy

238
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,719
and other leaders were saying this is

239
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,480
too soon, Richard. It's not a

240
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
presidential election year. Hold off."

241
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,879
But when Richard said, "I want to do it.

242
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,399
I want to do it now. It's the right

243
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,159
thing to do." We said, "We'll help you

244
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,639
on that." And I'll typically when you

245
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:52,079
run a ballot initiative and you lose,

246
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,799
you lose. But with respect to Prop 19

247
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,160
six years ago, that initiative lost by

248
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:00,879
seven points, right? But in fact, it

249
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:04,319
transformed the national dialogue. It

250
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,000
was the first time, right? I mean,

251
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,278
literally in six months, we went from

252
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,879
having people from journalists and

253
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,399
others saying, "Ah, legalized marijuana

254
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,559
never happened." to people going, "How

255
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,480
come you didn't win?" Somehow a

256
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,639
consciousness shifted at that moment.

257
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,480
And so, Richard Lee will always deserve

258
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,399
his historical credit for having been a

259
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,200
catalyst, even with his loss, and

260
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,919
opening this thing up. Right now, the

261
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,278
other piece of

262
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:33,199
this is about as we move forward, one of

263
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:34,039
my fears as we try to end the broader

264
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,079
drug

265
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:41,199
war is not to leave the rest of this

266
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,359
drug policy more reform movement behind,

267
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,120
right? I mean, most people, you know,

268
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,800
with marijuana, part of the reason we

269
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,919
focus on medical back in 20 years ago

270
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,278
was because the majority said it was

271
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,120
time to end. Part of the reason was

272
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:52,879
because the large majority of illicit

273
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,639
drug use in America use nothing but

274
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,559
marijuana, right? I mean, there are a

275
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,799
range of reasons for this, right? Half

276
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,719
the drug arrests in America are on

277
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,639
marijuana, although not half the people

278
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,720
incarcerated on drug law violations.

279
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,958
When you look at people going behind

280
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,200
bars, right, and and spending years

281
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,599
behind bars for low-level cocaine and

282
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,120
heroin meth

283
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,278
offenses, that it's not right either. No

284
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,679
matter how much you hate those drugs,

285
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,958
that's not right. And my fear now is

286
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,679
that as we move forward with legalizing

287
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:26,159
marijuana, let's not leave behind our

288
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:30,958
commitment to rolling back this broader

289
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:32,799
drug war, right? You know, I mean, Drug

290
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,039
Policy Alliance already positioned where

291
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,958
we're beginning to say our 20-year

292
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,639
commitment to marijuana legalization.

293
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,159
We've been in a pivotal leadership role

294
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,519
throughout with the the first seven

295
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,039
medical marijuana initiatives and many

296
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,560
of the state legislative efforts. And

297
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,000
we've had a hand in all four of the

298
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,439
legalization efforts that have been

299
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,839
succeeding United States and in

300
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,360
Washington DC and in Uruguay. But we

301
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,360
know is that as this thing picks a

302
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
momentum of its own, our mission is

303
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,278
going to be to some extent to try to end

304
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,159
the broader drug war. And for example,

305
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,078
most importantly to advance the notion

306
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:05,838
which is already common place in Europe

307
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:08,879
and other parts of the world that nobody

308
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,839
but nobody should lose their freedom or

309
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:15,200
go to jail simply for possessing any

310
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,079
substance for their own use. Right? I

311
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,160
mean, whether you're a recreational user

312
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,838
of coke or an addicted user of heroin,

313
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,278
whatever it might be, we don't know how

314
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,639
we're going to make it available legally

315
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,159
or whether it's going to be maintenance

316
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,919
programs like you got in Europe. But

317
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,559
what it does mean is the notion that

318
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,319
nobody but nobody should be losing their

319
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,679
freedom or going to jail simply for that

320
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,200
little bit they got in their pocket or

321
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,599
they're using whether recreational or

322
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,680
addicted user. That's a core principle

323
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,200
because it taps in to what is our

324
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:46,359
underlying most core principle which is

325
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,759
that we

326
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:53,320
ultimately must have sovereignty over

327
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:55,399
our own minds and bodies. That core

328
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,800
principle is

329
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,480
absolutely vital no matter what. The

330
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,159
same way as the first amendment just

331
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,720
doesn't just protect good speech or

332
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,958
gentle speech. It protects ugly speech

333
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,040
and despicable speech and we have to

334
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,719
hold on to that. Now we begin to get in

335
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,240
an era where elements of political

336
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,360
correctness and protecting everybody. So

337
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,278
we have to sacrifice the first

338
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,399
amendment. But you don't sacrifice the

339
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,159
first amendment because when you start

340
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,120
to sacrifice the most offensive forms of

341
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:20,240
speech for all sorts of

342
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,679
rationalizations, then you begin to

343
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,360
sacrifice other types of speech. And the

344
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,239
same, hey, I'm a good old marijuana and

345
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,639
psychedelics guy. You know, I love my

346
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,919
weed. Psychedelics been good to me. you

347
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,480
know, my profound spiritual experiences,

348
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,159
you know, you know, never much care for

349
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,159
cocaine. I got to admit to me it was

350
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,559
like, you know, having too much coffee

351
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,838
and post-nasal drip. I mean, you know,

352
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,759
but I understand some of my friends

353
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,279
became poets when they did cocaine. But

354
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,639
the fact of the matter is that core

355
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,120
principle of sovereignty of our own

356
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,200
minds and bodies has to hold not just

357
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,039
for the drugs that we love, but the

358
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,440
drugs that we hate and the people who

359
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:59,360
consume them. And there's

360
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,320
another there's another piece to this

361
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,639
was when you look at the origins of drug

362
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,760
prohibition in this country. When you

363
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,240
look at who's been disproportionately

364
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,720
decimated by this drug war, arrested,

365
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,079
targeted, punished, incarcerated, it is

366
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,320
overwhelmingly people of color, black

367
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,799
people and brown people. Goes back to

368
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,560
the first, you know, even Asian people,

369
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,319
right? The first, you know, anti-opium

370
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,319
laws were about Chinese minorities

371
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,240
coming to California, Nevada, 1870s and

372
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,000
80s. The the first anti- cocaine laws

373
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,600
were about blacks storing cocaine in the

374
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,120
south in the early 20th century. The

375
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,639
first anti-marijuana laws were about

376
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,240
Mexican-Americans, Mexican migrants in

377
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,919
the teens and the 20s in the west and

378
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,839
the southwest, right? You look at the

379
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,000
origins of these laws are steeped in

380
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,600
racism and racial prejudice and racial

381
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,600
stigmatization. But then when you look

382
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,639
at who's getting you look in California

383
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,959
where for many years not one white

384
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,240
person was prosecuted on a crack offense

385
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,638
even though white people were lots of

386
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,240
white people were doing crack right but

387
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,759
just where they were looking in my state

388
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,519
of New York where we had these notorious

389
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,278
Rockefeller drug laws and and you had

390
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,360
95% of the people behind bars for

391
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,879
selling or possessing cocaine and heroin

392
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,639
were black or brown. But that was not

393
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,799
true of 90% of the people possessing or

394
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,399
using that drug. Right? You know, with

395
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,679
marijuana that almost any place in

396
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,919
America that if you were to randomly

397
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:21,198
stop 100 black kids, 100 brown kids, 100

398
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:23,278
white kids and look in their pockets,

399
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,838
roughly the same percent would have a

400
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,320
little weed in their pocket. But in

401
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,480
every city in

402
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,320
America, the black kid is two to 10

403
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,159
times more likely to get busted than the

404
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,760
white kid. The brown kid is probably,

405
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,759
you know, two to five times more likely

406
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,679
to get busted than the white kid. And

407
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,958
that on some level, I mean, how can it

408
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:45,919
be that you're black, white, brown,

409
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,958
you're doing the same thing, but that

410
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,078
person is the one who's going to get

411
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:52,000
shafted, right? And he's going to get

412
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:53,359
shafted here because he lives in a in a

413
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,440
black neighborhood where you got tons

414
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,560
more cops there. Or alternatively, he's

415
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,920
walking through a white neighborhood and

416
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,359
people, what are you doing here? Right?

417
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,039
I mean, you're damned if you do, damned

418
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,879
if you don't on this sort of stuff,

419
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:05,039
right? So understanding as I'm talking

420
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,879
to this mostly beautiful white audience

421
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,399
here, but let's understand and there

422
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,240
have been millions and millions of white

423
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,240
people but then slammed and killed and

424
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,399
hurt and damaged by this horrible drug

425
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,480
war as well. But understand that the

426
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,278
disproportionate impact on this makes

427
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,480
this a particularly venal public policy.

428
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,720
And when you have a book out there by

429
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,560
Michelle called the new Jim Crow,

430
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,959
understanding that the war on drugs is

431
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,518
the new Jim Crow from slavery to Jim

432
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:33,278
Crow to the modern-day war on drugs. you

433
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,120
are all part of this thing. Now, that

434
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,639
brings me here to California right now.

435
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,399
I live in New York, by the way. I'm not

436
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,159
a California. I'm very proud of my

437
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,759
California team for all the work they're

438
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,679
doing this, you know, but this

439
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,000
initiative and I have to say I'm very

440
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,319
thankful to one of my new favorite

441
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,360
billionaires, Sean Parker, because I

442
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,040
mean that guy, you know, I don't, to my

443
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,480
knowledge, he has not invested or

444
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,759
planning to invest in this industry.

445
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,039
When I've sat down and been talking with

446
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,959
him about this, I've known him for about

447
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,879
eight, nine years now. when we talk

448
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,799
about this stuff, it's about good

449
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,199
governance. It's about smart public

450
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,438
policy. It's about moving America and

451
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,439
the world in the right direction. Right?

452
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,360
That his commitment to doing this and

453
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,199
the partnership that we've had with him

454
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,558
has been absolutely pivotal to making

455
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,400
the possibility that California is going

456
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:19,480
to legalize marijuana 6 weeks in a day

457
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:24,559
from today very very real.

458
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:26,640
Right? I mean, I'll tell you, I I am I'm

459
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,160
nervous cuz it's part of my job to be

460
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,919
nervous. I'm not a naturally nervous

461
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,320
person, but I mean the fact is when

462
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,640
those polls came out a couple days ago,

463
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,519
first the PPIC poll and then the field

464
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,160
poll with different methodologies, but

465
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:43,160
each one of them showing 60% support for

466
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,919
legalizing marijuana for for for Prop

467
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,240
64. I haven't had the experience of

468
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,160
having numbers that good just six weeks

469
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,599
to go. Now, my job is not to get

470
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,679
overconfident. It's tell you not to be

471
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,519
overconfident as well, right? And quite

472
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,120
frankly, any one of you can even give

473
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,558
five bucks to help this thing over the

474
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,319
top. I mean, I'm pouring millions of

475
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,399
dollars into this thing. I'm raising it

476
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,599
all over the place. I'm depriving my the

477
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,038
rest of my organization of other

478
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,558
resources to do this sort of stuff. So

479
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,319
whether you want to go to the website

480
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,000
CRMR and do it, whether you want to go

481
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,558
to our back table drug policy and make a

482
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,200
tax law, do something. Do something.

483
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,839
Just a little something, right? Just

484
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,759
have a little skin in the game. You

485
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,599
know, have that feeling that when that

486
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,079
thing wins on election day, you can say,

487
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,759
"I gave just a little bit to make this

488
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,359
happen." Just do it because it's the

489
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:31,679
right thing to do. Just a little bit.

490
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,359
Little bit. Little bit. Not going to

491
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,240
cost you a lot, but you're going to feel

492
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,678
good that you did it. You, believe me,

493
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,599
you're going to feel good that you did

494
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,798
it. But I'll tell you what else. The

495
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,240
rest of the initiatives, I think some of

496
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:43,759
you know the lay of the land right now.

497
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,240
You know, we got initiatives up in

498
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,400
Arizona and Nevada and Maine and

499
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,919
Massachusetts. DPA, drug policy alliance

500
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,679
work with marijuana policy project and

501
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,679
local activists to draft these things

502
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,200
around the country. MPP with local

503
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,798
activists been taking the lead on the

504
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,480
fundraising these other states the

505
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,400
polling in the polling in almost all

506
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,120
these states most of the polls most of

507
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,960
the time show more people in favor than

508
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:09,119
against that's no guarantee of victory

509
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,960
especially six weeks out especially when

510
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,119
there are rumors of Sheldon Adlesen or

511
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,798
Aden pouring millions of dollars into

512
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,239
the campaign against Nevada. We're not

513
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:17,839
sure if that's true yet, but we think it

514
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,279
is. And he just bought the local paper,

515
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,599
which went from being pro- legalization

516
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,079
to anti, right? And he put a million

517
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,759
dollars in against the medical

518
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:27,678
mariju. And then you got some opioid

519
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,359
manufacturer trying to get into some

520
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,720
part of the cannabis pharmaceutical

521
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,719
stuff, pouring money, a half million

522
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,720
dollars into Arizona. And you got some

523
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,400
crazy woman in Virginia who thinks all

524
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,240
marijuana users are terrorists, pouring

525
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,679
over a million dollars into California.

526
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,400
So, it's not as if this is just going to

527
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,120
be a walk in the park, right? We got to

528
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,840
win. Well, we have to win California.

529
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,439
This is the no lose, right? We have to

530
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,519
win it. I mean, imagine how terrible it

531
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,200
would be if we lost it. We have to win

532
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,558
it, right? But I mean, the rest of these

533
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,840
things, we got to win a few of these

534
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,200
other ones as well. And then there's

535
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,959
medical. Florida's looking good, but

536
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,400
there's real money on the other side.

537
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,000
You know, Missouri broke my heart

538
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,840
because if we got that, just a little

539
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,200
screw up on the signature collection. We

540
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,639
were about to make it and the numbers

541
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,919
were great and that's not going to be on

542
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,360
the ballot. I'm sad to say.

543
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,038
Arkansas, this is the new world. two

544
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,959
initiatives, both trying to make on the

545
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,480
ballot, one trying to sue the other to

546
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,160
get them out of there. And the one that

547
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,240
I don't like is the one I mean, it'll

548
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,000
it'll be a that step forward, but you

549
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,679
know, it's basic guys just trying to

550
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,200
make a lot of money for themselves and

551
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,440
not caring about the broader policy

552
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,960
stuff and just an ugly game. It's part

553
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,558
of what we're getting into. We almost

554
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,240
had that happen in Maine as well, but

555
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,158
we're able to get both sides to get

556
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,919
together and just do one initiative. you

557
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,520
know, North Dakota popped up going to

558
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,360
have medical marijuana, but you know,

559
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,759
they should have called us first because

560
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:44,719
they drafted this initiative and I hope

561
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,798
it wins, but it wasn't as good as it

562
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,480
could be. You know, in Montana, they're

563
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:49,839
trying to fix something in the past.

564
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,759
This is going to be the year of

565
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:55,639
marijuana come election day. Five

566
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:57,919
legalization initiatives, three or four

567
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,880
medical. I don't think we can win all of

568
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,559
them. I hope we can. I'm reassured by

569
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,280
the fact that in all four states that

570
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:07,759
won, Alaska, Washington, Colorado, and

571
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,240
uh Oregon, in every one of them, the

572
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,000
final tally, 55% in favor in three of

573
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,759
those states, in Alaska, a little less,

574
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,839
was higher than we expected in the late

575
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,279
polls. So, I'm hoping that there's that

576
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:20,319
thing lurking out there that's going to

577
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,480
be good, right? But here's why I feel

578
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,439
special about California. I mean, it's

579
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,759
not just that you guys were first with

580
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,880
215. And I feel bad you didn't go first

581
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,879
with legalization, you know, but you got

582
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,400
your moment now. And the fact of the

583
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,919
matter is the market here is more than

584
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,519
double the size of all the four other

585
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,038
states that have already legalized,

586
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,200
right? And the fact of the matter is

587
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,038
that all eyes are on California. And it

588
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,440
may be a very blue state, but all eyes

589
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,079
are still on California. But there's

590
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,120
some other things going on with this

591
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:55,199
initiative. Apart from the

592
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:57,079
fact that it is the most thoughtfully

593
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,038
designed

594
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,678
initiative ever to happen in the

595
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,919
marijuana field apart from the fact that

596
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,519
one of my key cal colleagues Tamar Todd

597
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,200
who's been the lead drafter of many

598
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,798
marijuana initiives around the country

599
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,038
did inter you know basically interviewed

600
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,038
hundreds of stakeholders from humble to

601
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,798
LA to industry to government to what

602
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,240
have you and got it in apart from the

603
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,000
fact that even many of the people who

604
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,400
were competing with Prop 64 to get their

605
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,558
own initiative are now joining hands on

606
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,000
64 and saying we got to win this and I'm

607
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,678
very grateful for the folks who are

608
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,960
willing to do that after the it was like

609
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,240
it's almost like being in a primary

610
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,360
battle where all a sudden you come out

611
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,279
of the primaries everybody's got to get

612
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,119
behind the 101 but that's really

613
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,639
beginning to happen now but there's some

614
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,399
other stuff going on in this initiative

615
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,000
that's really important the fact that

616
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,280
it's the first statewide initiative on

617
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,960
marijuana to be endorsed by the

618
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,038
statewide medical association California

619
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,400
medical association unprecedented the

620
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,480
fact that it's got the endorsements of

621
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,080
major environmental groups right I mean

622
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,798
absolutely do one of them just came out

623
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,879
a couple days ago. Also unprecedented in

624
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,798
that way, right? The support we're

625
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,400
getting from unions and others,

626
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,400
absolutely pivotal, from civil rights

627
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,480
groups, absolutely pivotal. But you know

628
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,440
what else is

629
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,798
special? This is not just about

630
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,640
legalizing weed. It's also about

631
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:11,000
sentencing reform and about social

632
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:14,480
justice and about human rights. You

633
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,319
know, this initiative basically says

634
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,679
that if you've ever been convicted of a

635
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,519
drug felony, that cannot be the sole

636
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,759
basis of excluding you from getting a

637
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,918
legal license in the new legal market.

638
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,519
And that is pivotally important given

639
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,200
the grossly disproportionate way that

640
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,319
people of color have been landed up with

641
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,360
criminal convictions for doing the same

642
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,839
thing that white people have been doing

643
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,959
for a long, long time. This is the first

644
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,959
initiative that basically

645
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,720
says, I think it's the first one, if

646
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,400
you've ever been convicted of any

647
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,360
marijuana offense that would no longer

648
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,280
be an offense under Prop

649
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:49,759
64, you can apply even if you're still

650
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,918
behind bars to have that fund that

651
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,919
offense expuned or removed from your

652
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,919
record.

653
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,678
This initiative, I believe, is the first

654
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,000
one that says if you're under the age of

655
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,240
18 and you get picked up with weed, you

656
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,919
may get an infraction and have to do a

657
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,079
little community service or something,

658
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,919
but when you turn the age of 18, that

659
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,439
offense you got before you're 18 is

660
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,640
automatically wiped off your

661
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,159
record. Hundreds of thousands of people

662
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,440
in California have been hurt by these

663
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,360
laws and have these things hanging

664
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,038
around the records. This initiative is

665
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:25,678
the first one that

666
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:28,240
says up to $50 million after a few years

667
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,240
is going to go specifically to help

668
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,599
those communities that have been harmed

669
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,919
by the drug war,

670
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:37,199
right? You know, and 60% of the money is

671
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,038
going to go to help kids and not

672
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,278
bullshit stuff, but stuff that we wrote

673
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,240
in there to make it real. And 20% of

674
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:43,599
that stuff is going to go for

675
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,440
environmental and not just cleaning up

676
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,199
the mess that some growers have made

677
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,519
over the years, but even trying to

678
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,200
invest in smart environmental stuff,

679
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,278
envir parks, maintenance, that sort of

680
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,200
stuff. And 20% is going to go for local

681
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,440
law enforcement, but only in those

682
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,919
communities, right, that actually are

683
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:04,360
allowing the retail sale, right, and

684
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:06,640
production of cannabis. Okay?

685
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,038
So, but the other reason I care about

686
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,480
this

687
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:12,480
thing, it's not just that when this

688
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,000
passes in California election day that

689
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,120
it's going to reverberate throughout the

690
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,720
country. It's going to reverberate

691
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:22,719
globally, right? I got I got

692
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,120
tell about a year and a half ago I was

693
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,200
on a plane going from San Francisco to

694
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,439
Mexico

695
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,880
City and I looked to my right about an

696
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,278
hour before and there's sitting Jerry

697
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,480
Brown and his wife and last time I knew

698
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:40,880
Jerry Brown when he was the mayor of

699
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,880
Oakland and and we had a really vicious

700
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,400
fight on television right before ballot

701
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,240
edition of 2008 I hadn't seen him since

702
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,519
then went over said hello he remembered

703
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,960
the vicious fight but we put that behind

704
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:52,240
us. Um, you want to see that, go on

705
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,159
YouTube and type in the words either

706
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,038
rude debate or really rude debate. What

707
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:00,080
pops up is me and Jerry being unfriendly

708
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,839
with one another. Um, but I said, you

709
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,918
know, what are you going to are you

710
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,599
going to see President Ponto down there?

711
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,038
He said, yeah. So, what are you going to

712
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,038
say if he asks you about legalizing

713
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:11,440
marijuana in California? I don't know.

714
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,640
Huh. Said, well, you know, what should I

715
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,840
say? I said, well, you know, look, the

716
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,400
fact is we're going to get on the ballot

717
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,839
and it's probably going to win, right?

718
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,600
Well, you go, you know, marijuana is

719
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,639
gonna be the damn nation of civilization

720
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,558
and society and d, you know, look at

721
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,080
him. Are you crazy? You know, half

722
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:27,200
people know Jerry Brown said he used to

723
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:28,720
smoke, other half don't. I don't know

724
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,319
what the truth is. Yeah, she said she

725
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,640
could find. We have confirmation right

726
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,158
here that he used to smoke. So, who the

727
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,080
hell knows what? Maybe had a bad trip

728
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,919
sometime. But any the fact of the matter

729
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,319
is he did go. He did meet with President

730
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,240
Ponto. President Po did ask him what he

731
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,278
thought and Jerry Brown said, "I think

732
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,359
it's going to be I think it's going to

733
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:47,200
win." And said nothing bad, right? And

734
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,519
we're hoping he continues to say nothing

735
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,880
bad, right? I mean, the fact it's going

736
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,639
to be a billion dollars in tax revenue

737
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,400
and this guy's legacy is solving your

738
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,159
state's budget crisis, you know, has got

739
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,519
to look promising. And the fact that

740
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,880
there's been some law enforcement buying

741
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,639
and other stuff like that got to be

742
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,960
promising. But the fact is, you got out

743
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,480
of Mexico and I asked my Mexican friends

744
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,400
and allies and government people, what's

745
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,000
it going to take to change the the drug

746
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,000
war in Mexico and the whole thing?

747
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,400
100,000 dead in the drug wars in Mexico

748
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,159
last last 10 years, last five years. And

749
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,159
they say when California legalizes

750
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:19,600
marijuana and I'll say what about

751
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,960
Washington, Colorado. They say that

752
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,798
helped. What about Oregon Alaska? That

753
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,519
helped. But California, if you do Texas,

754
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,918
too, that'd be big. But California,

755
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,918
right? It is going to reverberate in

756
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,000
Mexico, in Central America, the

757
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,278
Caribbean, and in Latin America. We've

758
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,880
been working with our Latin American

759
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,079
allies to try to roll back the drug war

760
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,760
there, and they keep banging their

761
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:39,119
heads. in this peace agreement that's

762
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,558
going to happen in Colombia between the

763
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,839
FARC, the leftwing gorillas who have

764
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,759
been involved in drug dealing and the

765
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,199
government looks very promising. But I

766
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,759
mean, quite frankly, even in Latin

767
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,600
America now, they want to know what's

768
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,440
going on with marijuana in the US.

769
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,359
Medical marijuana from Brazil to

770
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,759
Colombia to Mexico to Costa Rica to

771
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,359
Chile is the issue that's moving. and

772
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,519
they're seeing how the medical marijuana

773
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,759
issue back in the late 90s, late 2000s

774
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,519
helped to transform the dialogue in our

775
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,278
country and to change the face of

776
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,200
marijuana and educate people who were

777
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,880
closed on marijuana. And they see that's

778
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,798
the way things are moving as well.

779
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,840
Right? People in Jamaica where they're

780
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:13,679
trying to inch their way towards

781
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,119
legalization, but they're still scared

782
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,440
of what the US government will do to

783
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:20,079
them in one way or another. California

784
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,759
goes, it gets very hard for anybody to

785
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,439
start rolling this stuff back at this

786
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,240
point. It's still not going to be 100%

787
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,240
in the bag, right? bigger events have

788
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,399
been turned around in the past, but it's

789
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,079
going to be huge. It means that when we

790
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,599
go to the United Nations and are talking

791
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,038
about, are we going to keep cannabis in

792
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,119
these international conventions that we

793
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,558
have that much more traction, right? It

794
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,719
means that when Canada hopefully moves

795
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,720
forward to legalize marijuana next year

796
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,798
and God bless Justin Trudeau, we need

797
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,480
leadership like that. You know, I got to

798
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,158
tell you, you look around the world now,

799
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,399
you look at that bastard Putin, the

800
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,320
biggest mafiosi in the world. You look

801
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,239
at Chinese leadership, she is just

802
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,398
becoming a dictator. You look at Erdigan

803
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,399
in Turkey. You look at what's going on

804
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,398
in Hungary and in Poland. You look at

805
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,239
the mess in Brazil and practical civil

806
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:06,239
disorder in Venezuela. I mean, you look

807
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,839
at this ugliness going on. And I got to

808
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,839
say, I look around and say, who's good

809
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:12,398
out there? Justin Trudeau is at the top

810
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,158
of my list.

811
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:15,599
I kind of like the Pope, too, even

812
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,679
though he's kind of closed on this

813
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,719
issue.

814
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,960
And truth be told, I mean, we slammed

815
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,798
President Obama in his first term. And

816
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,798
his people would say, if we get a second

817
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,359
term, we'll be there. And I got to hand

818
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:31,119
it to him. Do not take for granted the

819
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,038
extent to which the White House and the

820
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,959
Justice Department have allowed this

821
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,960
stuff to proceed. That was not

822
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,440
inevitable. and the fact that they still

823
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,960
have a DEA saying bullshit all the time

824
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,720
and a national center of drug abuse

825
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,000
doing bullshit all the time and that

826
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,679
Obama's kind of letting that whole

827
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,200
conflict play out. But the fact of the

828
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,798
matter is what's opening up here

829
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,240
notwithstanding with the letter of

830
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:53,918
federal law is a credit to this

831
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,399
administration, right? You know, now I'm

832
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,600
not supposed Let me take off my How much

833
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:01,918
time do I have left by the way?

834
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:04,158
A few few more minutes. Okay, I I won't

835
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,159
go through this long here. Go for it.

836
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,640
So, let me just take off my Drug Policy

837
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,278
Alliance hat here and my drug, you know,

838
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,960
and just speak personally for a second

839
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,798
about the spectacle that's going to

840
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,880
happen tonight and over the next six

841
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:21,119
weeks. Um, from a drug policy

842
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:25,240
perspective, there is no question but

843
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:29,719
that Hillary is better

844
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,720
than the other guy.

845
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:35,678
And I mean it did not reassure me that

846
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,120
Governor Christie, who's been mixed on

847
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,559
these issues, right? We've we have an

848
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,239
office in New Jersey. He's been mixed on

849
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:43,038
this stuff. You never know. Like last

850
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,399
week, week ago, okay, medical mar PTSD,

851
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:45,599
but meanwhile he's in the primary

852
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:46,719
saying, "Smoke your weed now because I

853
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,879
become president. I'm going to bust you

854
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,319
all right." I mean, so he's unbr but the

855
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,399
thought of him as a potential attorney

856
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:56,398
general candidate or something. Not

857
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:57,359
promising. Sheldon add screwed Trump.

858
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:58,719
You're only going to give him five

859
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,319
million, 100 million. he's pouring into

860
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,319
the Republicans, right? But the fact

861
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,639
that AD was the first major Republican

862
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,319
donor say, "I'll back that guy." And AD,

863
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,240
meanwhile, is pouring the only guy

864
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,678
pouring seven figures money against

865
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,319
marijuana reform. Right? Not promising.

866
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,759
And that his VP is Mike Pence from

867
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:19,759
Indiana, who has been the far evil side

868
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,200
on the drug war. I mean, finally as

869
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:22,798
governor, he finally agreed to allow a

870
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,080
little needle exchange where a whole ton

871
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,000
of people, basically white people,

872
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:27,278
started getting HIV and stuff like that.

873
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,359
And so, he really had to do something.

874
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,558
But he's been a nightmare as well. So I

875
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:31,839
don't know that Trump, you know, he's a

876
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:33,278
New Yorker. He doesn't give a damn. He

877
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:34,558
could say, in fact, I think he did 20

878
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:35,599
years ago said, "Let's legalize all

879
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:37,119
drugs." And then he'll say something

880
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,398
else. You know, whatever comes out of

881
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,000
his mouth, you can't count on anything.

882
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,079
He could flip-flop any which way. But

883
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,240
the people around him and the people

884
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:49,678
he'll appoint, not good. Hillary, she

885
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,720
doesn't have this in her, you know? I

886
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,640
mean, Obama was more cool with it, but

887
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,640
Hillary is going to Democratic

888
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,799
fundraisers and saying, "I promise you I

889
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,038
will be at least as good as Obama was on

890
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:03,440
this." And that's important. That's

891
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,359
important, right? She's willing to sign

892
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,600
on to stuff about ending the drug war in

893
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,599
a big way. She gets the problems of mass

894
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,599
incarceration. She gets some of this

895
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,439
stuff. She's paying attention. So from

896
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:17,759
that and look, Gary Johnson,

897
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,759
libertarian, listen, Gary, we opened

898
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,759
office in New Mexico back in January

899
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,079
2000 when Gary was governor of New

900
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,839
Mexico and he and I became fairly close,

901
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,278
right? He was a libertarian Republican

902
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,839
governor wanted to move drug policy

903
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:32,159
reform in the right direction, right?

904
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,599
And and and and and basically the

905
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,039
Democratic legislature hated him because

906
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,038
he was vetoing all the spending bills.

907
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:40,000
And we opened up to work in a bipartisan

908
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:42,158
way with both of them. Gary Gary Johnson

909
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
signed a whole host of things from

910
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,320
giving back former felons the right to

911
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,839
vote to all forms of diversion programs

912
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,158
to getting behind our medical marijuana

913
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,038
bill which only passed some years later.

914
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,679
I think it may well

915
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:58,798
be Gary Johnson increased state spending

916
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,720
on drug treatment by 50%. That

917
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,398
libertarian cost cutting governor did

918
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,558
and I think we brought out the best in

919
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,798
Gary. He did the right stuff there. He

920
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,960
did the right stuff. But the fact of the

921
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:11,119
matter is there's an election happening.

922
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,720
If you live in a nonswing state, you're

923
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,079
in California, you're in New York,

924
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,798
you're in Mississippi, you're in

925
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,558
whatever it is, vote for Gary, vote for

926
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,960
Jill Stein, vote for whoever you want to

927
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:25,839
do, but if you live in a swing

928
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,319
state, there's a real choice. now a real

929
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,839
choice whether it's about drug policy

930
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,678
and don't let get me going on my

931
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,839
personal views about the future of the

932
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,399
country in this world and you know so

933
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,398
I'll leave that as back to my DrakePa

934
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,240
hat so going

935
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:52,720
forward my

936
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:56,079
hope is that this industry as it grows

937
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,079
as it becomes more dynamic

938
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:03,839
can become a model of illegal industry.

939
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,599
Now, mind you, there's tactical reasons

940
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,078
for it to do that because this thing is

941
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,838
not in the bag as yet. And if this thing

942
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,359
goes south, if all of a sudden there's a

943
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:12,559
whole lot of bad product on the market,

944
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:14,319
if all of a sudden we have major

945
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,000
increases in adolescent marijuana use

946
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,000
and things like that, we got a problem

947
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,679
on our hands, right? If all of a sudden

948
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,039
there's all tons of tons of marijuana

949
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,639
being produced legally but shipped out

950
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,398
of state across state lines to states

951
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,320
that that we got a problem on our hand,

952
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,000
right? We know that the Obama

953
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,079
administration gave the states that

954
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,760
legalized a qualified green light to

955
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,320
proceed, but there's a whole bunch of

956
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,480
conditions, right? We know that they

957
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,359
said, "Hey, listen. In the 1970 federal

958
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,320
sub control subs act says it's in the

959
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:43,878
interest of drug policy behind but

960
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,480
advancing public health and public

961
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:49,199
safety. Marijuana legalization to keep

962
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,079
moving forward safely has to continue to

963
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:56,678
be about advancing public health and

964
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,679
public safety. That's how we succeed.

965
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,559
But I think because of the origins of

966
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:08,000
where this all came from, remember this

967
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:10,639
is basically never happened before.

968
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,320
There has never been a social justice

969
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:17,039
movement in American

970
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,880
history that resulted in the emergence

971
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,800
of a legal industry worth tens of

972
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,920
billions of dollars a year. I mean, if

973
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,200
you look at the other social justice

974
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,960
movements that we sometimes model

975
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,719
ourselves on or whose shoulders, you

976
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,000
know, we we step on as we move forward,

977
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:29,838
you know, gay rights, civil rights,

978
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,679
women's rights, all of those movements

979
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:33,759
as they preceded in America had

980
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,199
significant economic consequences, but

981
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,800
no one of them created a brand new

982
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,799
industry worth tens of billions of

983
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,560
dollars. The closest analogy

984
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,960
historically is the repeal of alcohol

985
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,639
prohibition, but even there that was

986
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,159
essentially just relegalizing a market

987
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:47,838
that had been legal just 15 years

988
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,879
before. We are doing something

989
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:52,799
unprecedented and truly new. It is truly

990
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,640
special. The benefit that will happen

991
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,000
almost automatically is that people

992
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:57,598
getting busted, especially black and

993
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,440
brown people getting busted for drugs,

994
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,440
that that opportunity is just no longer

995
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,119
be there for them to get busted. It

996
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,880
means that as we move forward to

997
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,640
legalize marijuana in the states where a

998
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:12,079
majority support that, we cannot forget

999
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:14,239
about what's happening in the south and

1000
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,320
other parts of this country where you

1001
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:18,719
still have people serving many years

1002
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,359
behind bars for a second or third

1003
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:23,358
marijuana possession offense. We cannot

1004
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:25,519
forget about the half the states where

1005
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:28,078
marijuana is not even legal for medical

1006
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:30,079
purposes as yet. We cannot forget about

1007
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,079
the millions of Americans continuing to

1008
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,160
be victimized in the workplace or the

1009
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,320
course in all sorts of ways and

1010
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,319
disproportionately victimized if you are

1011
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,359
poor, if you are young, or if you are of

1012
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,280
color. We cannot forget about that as

1013
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:47,719
you're making the money, man. Remember

1014
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,720
that piece and fight for that.

1015
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,159
So, I want to make this pitch to you.

1016
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,480
Think

1017
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:08,079
about as you move

1018
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,079
forward, making a

1019
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:15,159
promise to

1020
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:19,119
do just one good

1021
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:21,598
thing, just one good thing to make

1022
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,000
legalization of marijuana a better thing

1023
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,400
for society in the world. And by what I

1024
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,960
mean by one good thing, I mean something

1025
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,400
that does not help directly or even

1026
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,358
indirectly, maybe indirectly indirectly,

1027
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,800
but does not help your bottom line.

1028
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:42,078
It means the notion of tithing one, two,

1029
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:45,119
five, 10% of your sales or your profits

1030
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,839
to helping advance this cause further.

1031
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,559
It means making a commitment to

1032
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:52,559
diversity in this industry. It means

1033
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,799
making a commitment to setting up some

1034
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,159
little mentoring program so that people

1035
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,119
who might not otherwise have a chance to

1036
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:02,000
get into this industry can get into it.

1037
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,400
It means taking real pride in the

1038
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,480
quality of your product and in the way

1039
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,760
you try to make sure that the ro that

1040
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,280
people young people are not getting

1041
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,880
involved in this stuff and that you are

1042
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,119
really being careful and responsible

1043
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,200
about this stuff. There's make that

1044
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,640
commitment to yourself. You can tell me

1045
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,960
later if you want to do whatever, but

1046
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:24,879
just make the commitment to do one good

1047
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:27,280
thing. Just one good thing. Okay?

1048
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Because I I'm in California. I don't

1049
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,040
know how many of you know what what the

1050
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,960
word mench means. You know, mench is a

1051
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:35,440
Yiddish word. It basic Yiddish word

1052
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,838
refers to a man or human being. And what

1053
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,320
it really refers to is a human being who

1054
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:42,239
uses their head and their heart, you

1055
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,440
know, in the right ways in life, right?

1056
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:45,759
to treat their fellow human beings

1057
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,599
decently and etc. Right? And I remember

1058
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,760
people ask in TV program say what's your

1059
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,440
vision of a drug policy legalization?

1060
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,400
It's not just all drug legalization. I

1061
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,000
think we need to think about it

1062
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,280
arguments for it but no it's more subtle

1063
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,358
than that. Well, are you talking about

1064
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,760
just a kinder gentler drug war? No, no,

1065
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:03,119
no. Kind of. What I'm talking about is

1066
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,720
the menshite approach to drug policy.

1067
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,280
I'm talking about a way of dealing with

1068
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,039
drugs and drug users and drug markets

1069
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,359
that's about doing the right thing,

1070
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,119
making this thing fair. I would love to

1071
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,880
see that, you know, I'm kind of a small,

1072
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,640
beautiful guy. I would just assume not

1073
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,000
see big alcohol, tobacco,

1074
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,598
pharmaceutical, or consumer goods

1075
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,760
companies take over this whole thing,

1076
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:25,838
right? I'd like to see, you know, the

1077
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,400
the micro brewery market or the vineyard

1078
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:30,239
market be a dominant modality here. I'd

1079
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,838
like to see us get to the day when maybe

1080
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,439
we could have farmers markets in some

1081
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,358
parts of this country with some quality

1082
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,440
controls, but like to see I'd like to

1083
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:39,519
see that. I'd like to see this industry

1084
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,760
be reasonably taxed in a productive way

1085
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:45,039
so that basically the illicit side is

1086
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,760
essentially fading away, right? I'd like

1087
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,960
to see us work side by side while the

1088
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,480
pharmaceutical companies are producing

1089
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,000
their isolated, you know, products from

1090
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,000
the cannabis plant in ways that are

1091
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
going to help people, right? I'd like to

1092
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,039
see us do all these things in the right

1093
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,960
way. I think we can do it. We can do it.

1094
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:05,679
So, come election day, you know what to

1095
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,159
do. But don't just vote for Prop 64.

1096
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,679
Look at the rest of the ballot. There's

1097
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:10,719
another initiative that Jerry Brown's

1098
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,598
actually behind. Never thought I'd be

1099
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,199
getting behind Jerry Brownish, but Prop

1100
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,119
57, which is about parole reform and

1101
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,960
juvenile justice reform, putting fewer

1102
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,000
people behind bars. When you pull the

1103
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,000
lever for 64, pull the lever for 57 as

1104
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,920
well. Right. When we get into

1105
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,358
implementation, be at the table. Do so.

1106
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,760
I understand you got to protect your

1107
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:33,000
interest, but do it in the right way. So

1108
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,240
just to

1109
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,880
conclude, we are now beginning the

1110
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:41,039
second generation of the global drug

1111
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,440
policy reform movement. We've gone from

1112
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:44,719
215 and 96 legalizing medical marijuana

1113
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,480
to over half the states legalizing

1114
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,799
marijuana to California about to

1115
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,400
legalize marijuana 6 weeks from now and

1116
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,240
create a whole new model for how to do

1117
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,519
this thing. Right. Right. We that we are

1118
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,439
turning the country and we're beginning

1119
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:56,800
to back away from mass incarceration.

1120
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,800
But if we've hit the tipping point on

1121
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,519
marijuana legalization, we barely hit a

1122
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,359
turning point when it comes to ending

1123
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:04,880
mass incarceration in this country. You

1124
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,358
know, actually, it's nice. I somebody

1125
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,880
say where we are in mass incarceration,

1126
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:11,119
we've hit a turning point, but it's like

1127
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,480
turning around an ocean liner. I've

1128
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,079
never actually said that on an ocean

1129
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,318
liner, but it means that even when you

1130
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,200
point that in a new direction, it takes

1131
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:21,039
time to turn. And it means when we're do

1132
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:23,279
talking with people who use drugs, no

1133
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,800
matter what that drug is, no matter how

1134
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,280
much you hate that drug or had a bad

1135
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,200
trip with that drug, we're not going to

1136
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,440
demonize people simply because they use

1137
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:33,279
that drug. And if they use that drug and

1138
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,119
don't hurt anybody else, it's none of

1139
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,880
the government's business or even their

1140
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,880
employer's business so long as they're

1141
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,480
doing their

1142
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,559
job. And if they're struggling, if

1143
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,159
they're struggling with addiction, it

1144
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:45,679
means don't just whack them over the

1145
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:47,039
head and lock them up. Don't throw them

1146
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:48,639
into some drug court which is going to

1147
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:50,239
keep trying to chip them up and put them

1148
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,799
in there for longer if they can't be

1149
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,719
clean

1150
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,440
clean. It means let's do this the right

1151
00:41:54,719 --> 00:42:00,000
way. So listen everybody, best of luck

1152
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,159
on election day. Make it happen. Make it

1153
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,039
happen. Make lots of money. Do the right

1154
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:06,039
thing. Thank you so much.
