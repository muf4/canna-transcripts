00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,900
like guerrilla og or something and then

8
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:14,760
I washed it and it's the whole room just

9
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,830
stunk like blueberries I'm like dude

10
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,659
there's no way this is a new type of

11
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:26,868
gorilla that mean can you stand up this

12
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:26,868
like yeah yeah I can smell that

13
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,618
no 220 how you sit 190

14
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,969
just carry it curiosity that's all I do

15
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,280
uh I'm all big on making sure I get as

16
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:55,319
much contaminant out as possible so I

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,780
wash in a 220 kind of like these but

18
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,389
much bigger which I might want to talk

19
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,480
to you about if you can make me a custom

20
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,060
bag I'd really really like that because

21
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,530
it's so hard to find bags that fit the

22
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:13,140
what I want to use I'm very specific on

23
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,240
but what kind of size are you thinking

24
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:18,509
my big um yeah it's a big I'm looking

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:21,810
for I want it to fit a 44 gallon trash

26
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:23,189
can but here's the problem every single

27
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,870
place I look doesn't matter if I order

28
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:26,579
from Canada wacky bags doesn't order if

29
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,379
I order from Europe with where they're

30
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,630
using leaders you know what I'm saying

31
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:33,269
nobody can make me a big enough

32
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,789
circumference you know a big enough

33
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,730
diameter that fits and is short enough

34
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:40,229
the bags will be like six feet long and

35
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:43,079
I'm like I only need it like three feet

36
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:46,259
long but I need it wide yeah and nobody

37
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,209
makes one I do yeah I make that size 44

38
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:55,399
I make a lot of those now that's like if

39
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:59,939
it fits in that peer pressure being less

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:04,920
but we also make them fit as we roll

41
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:06,840
them around grow them around and like a

42
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,018
pump station and that pumps out with a

43
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,019
water pump like I don't use any pumps

44
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,849
I'm a gravity-fed guy I don't like my

45
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,439
half through a pump or any any type of

46
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:17,789
tubing I just feel like you're gonna

47
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,969
lose some are you're gonna weigh some

48
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:22,739
because I'm just it works good I know it

49
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,930
works and especially if I'm on like a

50
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,879
massive scale like some of the massive

51
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,040
scale guys that's what they do of course

52
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,019

red flag of rigmarole do your kradic

79
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,990
nonsense that doesn't even seem to be

80
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,150
real that they have to shell out another

81
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,129
50 60 grand for oh that sucks

82
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:05,109
you know what I mean like I've seen the

83
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:06,790
rooms where they can't that they've been

84
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,350
spending money and paying rent and

85
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,600
building these things in the town year

86
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,729
or a year it's been there for a year and

87
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,169
they can't open it because oh well this

88
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:16,379
paperwork didn't go through because some

89
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:18,459
jackwagon doesn't want to sign something

90
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:19,360
you know what I mean it's like this is

91
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:21,879
ridiculous

92
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,580
and the fact that we're just that we're

93
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,649
only allowing rich people to to work in

94
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:28,240
this industry is not fair there's been

95
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:32,500
so many people that put in so much hard

96
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:44,710
time and effort and and risk and risk

97
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:48,100
and they they need to release people

98
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:50,168
from jail that sell sold weed it's just

99
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,300
ridiculous that they're reducing

100
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:54,099
sentences I have some friends who got

101
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,960
arrested and it was actually good

102
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,890
because they got like all their stuff

103
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:01,750
expunged well they're a be a complete

104
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:03,370
expungement if you're gonna let rich

105
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,569
people do this just because they have

106
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:09,579
money that's not okay that's not the way

107
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:13,099
it works you

108
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:15,349
totally I'm doing nothing like you know

109
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,900
volatile you know there's I mean I

110
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:22,670
probably those closed-loop systems

111
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:25,219
that's not what I want to do you know we

112
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,590
made but there's places where you know

113
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,710
they're mixing a bad trash cans and

114
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:31,310
buckets left or right you know that's me

115
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:34,879
that's all I do

116
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,879
ten thousand grams like like some of the

117
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,319
big companies do ten thousand a month

118
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,089
there's there's like black market people

119
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:48,829
doing that much a day up there and big

120
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:51,079
barns just mixing they can have yes and

121
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:52,459
no ever yes and no because you can have

122
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:55,609
the small batches but you can always

123
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:57,639
just pour into it into a into one do you

124
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,840
know what I'm trying to say like all

125
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,120
your workers are going to the same

126
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,739
location Zac there's no need to drive

127
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,879
seven different cars they're just have

128
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:10,189
your mixers mix mix them all I mean you

129
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,079
can do large scales for sure I've seen

130
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:14,300
where like I've walked over to a guy and

131
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,370
he the guy has six trash cans going with

132
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,560
six different dudes and I'm like your

133
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,389
guys are way out of hand here I'm like

134
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,949
you're gonna clog all your bags you know

135
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,959
especially if you have a sticky product

136
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:26,240
in whoa why they got this to me one of

137
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,879
the questions I have is like as you see

138
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,400
more and more hash makers popping up and

139
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,319
you have a lot of people who want to

140
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:36,139
just be washing the best material as

141
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,120
their starting material like how do you

142
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,039
all like even if everyone's really good

143
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,709
you're all competing for a limited

144
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,750
supply of quality starting material so

145
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:47,870
how does that play out well that's

146
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,689
always the major factors can you get the

147
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,699
good material right so that was why I

148
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:54,469
did this because I knew the material was

149
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:57,199
there I have those connections with

150
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,700
local growers that are small boutique

151
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,430
growers where I'm gonna get the quality

152
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:02,990
cannabis and I'm gonna be able to

153
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,540
produce the amount that I need so that

154
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,550
everybody can be happy and it also helps

155
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,290
you know like the trimming situation is

156
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,030
going lower and lower and lower they're

157
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,200
paying people less and less and less and

158
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,909
they're giving them less and less and

159
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,918
less when you go to a trim used to go to

160
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,450
a trim and you would get catered to you

161
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,038
would get lunch you would have waters

162
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:21,740
and food and drink and you'd be able to

163
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,550
smoke and drink at a at a trim now it's

164
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,379
like corporate oh man

165
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,629
Erica and they're putting like I've gone

166
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,040
to a trim where there's like 15 Russian

167
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:29,389
girls that don't even speak English and

168
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,300
they're just like working these people

169
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:34,580
I'm like this isn't our this isn't our

170
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:38,659
community this isn't our group of people

171
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:41,740
like I don't know so now chopping all

172
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:44,719
the weed down putting it fresh frozen

173
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,190
you eliminate that entire step and

174
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,759
there's a lot of trimmers that are upset

175
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:55,130
with that also so there's the game is

176
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:58,220
changing on a major like it happened so

177
00:08:55,129 --> 00:09:01,009
fast too and you don't notice it I mean

178
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,360
we used titanium nails four years ago we

179
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:05,569
didn't even know what quartz was right

180
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,720
like the way things are smoked the way

181
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:12,740
things are done thankfully I'm glad

182
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,779
bubble bags came back hashes in right

183
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,250
now hash is so in yeah well that's what

184
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:19,039
I was saying so now you have everybody

185
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,379
making hash and if you want to be truly

186
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,519
good at it you got to start with that

187
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:24,200
but that was my point you got to start

188
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,449
so everyone's fighting for this limited

189
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,759
supply of poly it's like when you talk

190
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,440
to a Frenchie he's like once I can't

191
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,960
find what I'm looking for anymore I'm

192
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:37,070
done I tap out and I'm not gonna make

193
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,930
like b-grade hash mm-hmm no it's not

194
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,060
worth it to your company either right

195
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:42,859
but all the contracts have been made all

196
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:45,049
the big companies have their next ten

197
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,300
years all their farms like literally

198
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:49,490
locked in for the next ten years

199
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:51,289
all these farms that's one there's no

200
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,669
way you're gonna get the quality it has

201
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,709
a giant farm that you're gonna get out

202
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:58,129
of a batik grow that's why black market

203
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:02,389
will never go away it needs to be it

204
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:04,759
needs to be you know divvied up amongst

205
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:06,110
I guess maybe a couple local

206
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,840
dispensaries because the fact of the

207
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,220
matter is is the best marijuana is grown

208
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,019
in California there's no question about

209
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,490
that I've been all over the world I've

210
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:16,850
searched for it and you're not gonna

211
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:20,060
find better weed than here and to try to

212
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,909
like take that away from us the small

213
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:25,369
groups the small guys the small people I

214
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:29,569
just it's so wrong it's like we put me

215
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:34,820
putting so much effort in yes quickly

216
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:36,379
before we start can you open each one of

217
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,450
those and quickly talk about

218
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:40,659
yeah you're gonna aim it at me yeah for

219
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:45,879
sure here I'll maybe talk about a second

220
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:51,169
basically these right here are my

221
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:53,960
indoors these are my outdoors everything

222
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:55,909
is a whole plant fresh frozen we chop

223
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,170
the plant down freeze it immediately

224
00:10:55,909 --> 00:11:03,799
wash it freeze dry it after freeze

225
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:05,539
drying we I place it in 15 micron bags I

226
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:07,609
go the smallest that I can possibly find

227
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:11,990
and get I get those from rosin

228
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:14,690
devolution I press on a flux rosin press

229
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:18,139
most of my technique I take directly

230
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,910
from a good friend I think you guys have

231
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:22,340
actually interviewed him

232
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:24,529
Sunfire farms kidding him cannabis or

233
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,090
cannabis yeah yeah he's he's really

234
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,919
knowledgeable and he does really good

235
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,980
work and really passionate about what

236
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,629
like this is going on you know and then

237
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,610
most of my actual technique like

238
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,679
pressing and how I press and stuff like

239
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,379
that I get from superior solvent list

240
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:42,469
yeah they've been super super kind with

241
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:45,230
me and giving me you know information

242
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:48,620
that I can't find anywhere and in

243
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,970
reality though the the best information

244
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,769
is just getting your hands dirty and

245
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,990
figuring it out for yourself and you

246
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:56,509
know messing up but these right here

247
00:11:53,990 --> 00:12:01,279
this is Wi-Fi this is locally grown in

248
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:05,689
San Fernando Valley by a good friend it

249
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:08,449
was chopped down maybe a week ago yeah

250
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,730
washed the day after it was chopped down

251
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,230
and then pressed the day after that and

252
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,050
it's probably had like a five-day cure

253
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,610
yeah so this is this is fairly recent

254
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:18,349
and I like to give it a cure because

255
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,180
when you're when you're when you're

256
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,700
chopping down a fresh frozen plant it

257
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:26,299
hasn't had time to actually have all

258
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:28,009
those those smells and all that like the

259
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:29,599
plant is decomposing and it's doing a

260
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:31,490
lot of things it's fermenting it's doing

261
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,529
all sorts of cool stuff and when you

262
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,990
leave it in a jar close it it'll really

263
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:39,049
start to change and and make a really

264
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:43,250
good flavor this right here is the caps

265
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:46,729
cut the capital ater cut act one this is

266
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:49,759
maybe two weeks old this is a really

267
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:52,279
good batch it's extremely gasoline like

268
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:56,149
there's not there's not much marijuana

269
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:57,919
taste it's like extremely just Terps

270
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:01,159
it's almost all Terps it's almost too

271
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:04,969
heavy sometimes I like more of a OG

272
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:06,769
taste or I really like GMO just a little

273
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,649
more malware don't get me wrong GMOs

274
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:11,539
super stony this is an older batch of

275
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:13,490
GMO this is probably two months old I've

276
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:18,110
had it sitting and curing and you can

277
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:19,940
you can tell a major change and you can

278
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,730
see different colorations as I turn it

279
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,170
over like how it's much lighter on the

280
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,300
bottom and all the Terps have sort of

281
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:28,009
moved to the side and this is after like

282
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:31,069
like I said two months of sitting in a

283
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:32,629
cold room in the dark so there's just

284
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,250
stuff that I like to experiment with

285
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:37,879
this is like kind of you know how you

286
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:39,200
sees cannolis stuff cannoli stuff turns

287
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:41,120
a little darker because he likes to let

288
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,100
it sit for a long time yeah and no

289
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,899
matter what if if you let hash said it's

290
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,960
gonna darken because oxygen ruins

291
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:49,429
everything that's dead so the only thing

292
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,940
well it's also gonna make it a lot more

293
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:54,829
kind of couch lock yeah I mean people

294
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,530
say that but I think once you're smoking

295
00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:00,350
hash of this level I mean it's so stony

296
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:03,019
right come on you know what I mean like

297
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,550
you have to smoke so much to be able to

298
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:07,460
tell the difference between one to the

299
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:10,159
next I I smoke them all all the time and

300
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,170
the outdoor gets me just as high in my

301
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,620
opinion that is there some that's like

302
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:16,519
if I want to go like clean my house for

303
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,750
the next four hours

304
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:23,179
I think super Turkey and you know that's

305
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,100
what I think the person based because

306
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:26,719
there's people that smoke weed and want

307
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,190
to smoke and clean their house all the

308
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,240
time and then there's people that smoke

309
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,500
we didn't want to sit and play video

310
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,799
games and sit on the couch and do

311
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,409
nothing in Cheetos I I feel there's not

312
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:38,899
much of a difference even from sativa

313
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:40,610
indica where if you're high and you're

314
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:42,620
smoking hash you're gonna get high to

315
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,509
the point where you're gonna do whatever

316
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,830
it is you want to do I don't know if

317
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:49,159
there's the only thing that I know that

318
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:51,320
like makes you want to like clean or

319
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:53,299
like actual pharmaceutical drugs so you

320
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,740
know what I mean and I'm not I'm not I'm

321
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,789
not about to take some vicodin so I can

322
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,159
clean the house I'd rather just get

323
00:14:55,789 --> 00:15:00,579
stone to clean this one this one for

324
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,389
sure yeah I mean that I recommend

the experience yeah for sure is it all

331
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:21,988
the most definitely it's not a problem

332
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:27,178
powerful this is a really really nice

333
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:28,470
glass piece made by Eric Krunk and is he

334
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:30,838
local where is he from

335
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,548
Eric Krunk is a gypsy he lived a long

336
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,319
time in his car wandering around

337
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:37,139
Grateful Dead shows selling his pipes

338
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:39,509
and now these are like one of the most

339
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:42,629
sought-after pieces it's awesome in the

340
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:44,509
world there's maybe like ten other glass

341
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:47,999
blowers that are on his upper echelon

342
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:53,068
he's a really nice guy makes awesome

343
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:55,290
pieces and I don't know just a craftsman

344
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:57,298
super craftsman who would some of the

345
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:59,278
other people be that your respect at

346
00:15:57,298 --> 00:16:01,739
that level or you think are at that

347
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:06,480
level there's a there's a few I mean you

348
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:08,309
got Darby you have you Xin there's a few

349
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,918
of his apprentices that are super super

350
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:14,368
really talented but you know I

351
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:15,958
they pay him the respect which is really

352
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:20,009
nice those guys are like chunk and

353
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,208
hermit there's there's so many good

354
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,739
glass blowers out there and there's so

355
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:25,618
many lower glass blowers that are doing

356
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:27,619
such great work and for whatever reason

357
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:30,269
they're just not getting this extreme

358
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:32,069
blow-up of the of the market where these

359
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:33,600
are going for you know thirty to fifty

360
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:35,399
thousand dollars and they're making

361
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,989
something very equivalent but it's like

362
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,839
maybe two thousand dollars or fifteen

363
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:42,509
hundred dollars and it's just uh it's a

364
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,149
it's a weird it's a weird niche market I

365
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:46,798
guess you could say so but let's look

366
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:48,568
there are pieces that just go into

367
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:51,688
someone's like art collection basically

368
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:53,399
well no a lot of it is is these big hash

369
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:56,248
companies these newer hash companies or

370
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,230
these people that are I guess brokering

371
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:59,428
a lot of the hash it's all monopoly

372
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,989
money and they need to wash their money

373
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:03,149
so they'll buy something like this and

374
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:05,130
you know fifty thousand dollars then

375
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:07,019
they look cool they have more followers

376
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,778
on Instagram they have all that sort of

377
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:11,588
stuff oh don't tell them a secret huh

378
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:14,169
but yeah that's the way it goes man

379
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:16,720
so this is this is what's going on in

380
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:18,970
our world right now of our cannabis

381
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,220
community and it's really cool that

382
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,318
there's a lot of good cannabis coming

383
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,548
out from Michigan

384
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,349
there's cannabis that's really good I

385
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:29,408
was surprised when I went there I wasn't

386
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:32,349
really expect it was like I'm in the

387
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:34,659
Midwest and I met a lot of cool growers

388
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:36,788
and superiors all the list does insane

389
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:38,770
good work out there Michigan man melts

390
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:41,558
is awesome

391
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:42,849
they have great strains and they're

392
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:44,740
purposely not letting them out because

393
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:46,689
they know we got great strains to which

394
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,480
is hot which is cool I understand that

395
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:52,590
and I don't know I'm just happy that

396
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,149
that there's someone else and some other

397
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:59,349
communities out there that are taking

398
00:17:55,148 --> 00:18:02,589
the time to to perfect this and to make

399
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:05,079
it more healthy make it more enjoyable

400
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:06,548
you know what I mean the the fact that

401
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,139
we're smoking it this way is there's no

402
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:10,329
question about whether or not this is

403
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,009
the healthiest way to smoke it you can

404
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:13,449
vaporize it and that's all good but

405
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,788
you're not going to get all the terpenes

406
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,950
and and all of the mix of the plant that

407
00:18:15,788 --> 00:18:22,000
you need the way you're smoking this

408
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:24,880
there's no question about that wait so

409
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,308
where are you mostly sourcing your local

410
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,320
all very very local and if not it's

411
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:31,690
grown in my backyard and what do you try

412
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:33,099
car you sourcing all outdoor mats area

413
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,259
everything's indoor that I source

414
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:37,259
otherwise if I do do outdoor it's very

415
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:39,339
very limited and it'll only be in

416
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:42,548
october/november when the outdoor is

417
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:44,798
ready you know so what are your thoughts

418
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:46,179
on like what do you like about outdoor

419
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:51,429
and what do you like about indoor is a

420
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:53,740
kind of a loser is is 90% of the time

421
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:55,509
gonna be growing in soil first of all I

422
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,599
like so you'll always get a better taste

423
00:18:55,509 --> 00:19:02,140
I'd feel from soil you get usually a

424
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:05,798
better return on soil of your of your

425
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:08,380
hash and I could yield yield you will

426
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:10,990
always get a better yield in growing in

427
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,309
soil that's that's not a scientific fact

428
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,990
but that's just what the hash makers

429
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:15,158
have noticed you know none of this has

430
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,899
been written down nobody's writing a

431
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:21,399
book you know what I mean I wish they

432
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:24,519
did but it's it's more of hearsay you

433
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:28,159
know or whatever it may be

434
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:30,589
but do you need a damper yes I do need a

435
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,820
dabber I was just about to say that I'm

436
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:36,949
like huh you know what I did forget one

437
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:38,240
thing I'll be going now outdoor will

438
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,500
always come out a little darker I feel

439
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,859
just because you're gonna have more

440
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,089
elements the more Sun the more exposure

441
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:46,849
dirt and everything and every time I

442
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:49,009
wash outdoor the water is dirty you're

443
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:51,500
cleaning the water washing indoor it's

444
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:53,019
obviously going to be much nicer so

445
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,000
sorry

446
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:57,950
these are outdoor these are indoor well

447
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,589
I'm looking at the consistency's so this

448
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,910
has not been pressed right all of these

449
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:04,759
have been pressed all these have have

450
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,830
been exactly manufactured the exact same

451
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:09,710
way this is all strain dependency well

452
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:10,879
that's okay yeah yeah and you'll also

453
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,980
notice a little bit of different

454
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,630
consistency in the washes because the

455
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,329
first couple of washes if you mix them

456
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,760
you'll get more of the oils from the

457
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:22,389
plant and that the oils are what will

458
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,390
create this

459
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:44,080
that's it yeah no I I assumed it was

460
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:47,440
processed dependent and no not even I've

461
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,909
even had the exact same strain grown at

462
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,980
a different time of the year turned out

463
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,600
different thrown in the same room with

464
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,339
the same nutrients the same exact way

465
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:56,589
processed everything the exact same way

466
00:20:54,339 --> 00:21:00,129
because of the time of the year the

467
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:02,019
plant doesn't perform or it doesn't you

468
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,580
know do the same things it's doing at a

469
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:06,279
different time of the year just based on

470
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:08,589
outside parameters of whether it's

471
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,629
raining or whether it's windy and 115

472
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:16,689
degrees like it happens here it's

473
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:19,290
stainless perfect that's nice one I'm

474
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:25,298
gonna try it first you first okay

475
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:26,889
yes first and so you you said you did

476
00:21:25,298 --> 00:21:28,359
press all of this so are you or

477
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,509
everything's pressed are you doing

478
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:33,279
anything that you don't press or I do

479
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:35,079
pressing everything I press everything

480
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,970
people are like the full melt but then

481
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:39,849
you're separating a spectrum of the of

482
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,919
the plant you're pulling only 90 you

483
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:44,079
usually - like 120 or once some people

484
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,340
go to like 150 160 and it'll still melt

485
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,589
pretty good but you're gonna have a lot

486
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:49,389
of contaminant on your nail and these

487
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:51,759
things are expensive they're 180 bucks I

488
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,110
prefer the taste to this don't get me

489
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,740
wrong you get a slightly different high

490
00:21:53,109 --> 00:22:00,359
I've noticed off of off of the full melt

491
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:02,589
and you know before it's pressed but oh

492
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:04,959
and I don't to sit there and use four

493
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:07,720
q-tips to clean my banger every time and

494
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,190
I just don't want to do it that's

495
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,160
interesting that is kind of a functional

496
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,140
thing it's like if you had done banger

497
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,750
if bangers were disposable you'd be like

498
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:19,090
maybe but then also you're taking that

499
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,970
spectrum away so now you have your 40

500
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:23,740
you - 9000 or what 89 what are you doing

501
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:27,610
with that I don't ever see I've never

502
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:29,980
seen a single company sell 4289 you tell

503
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:32,079
me one that does I can't see a single

504
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,970
one on the market so either one they're

505
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:35,109
lying to you or they're doing something

506
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,120
else with their product where is it

507
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:40,029
going where is that massive amount of

508
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,589
hash going I want to know nobody will

509
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:43,210
answer those questions I'm just like

510
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:47,649
screw that I'm doing full spec here's my

511
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:49,720
spectrum I do 40 - 179 everything's

512
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:50,889
pressed on extremely small micron

513
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,509
so I know I'm getting all my

514
00:22:50,888 --> 00:22:54,579
contaminants out and yeah you might end

515
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:56,230
up with a bag full of hash still that

516
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:57,519
you've pressed and there's a shitload of

517
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,710
stuff in there that you didn't get out

518
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,329
well that's all you're contaminated so

519
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,460
that's why my hash is usually so clean

520
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:05,199
and burned so well you will never hear

521
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,288
no sizzling you know and all that stuff

522
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,319
so that's done you set this up nicely

523
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:13,929
I'm actually pretty fired up to try it

524
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,519
that's the way I've asked everybody and

525
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:16,809
nobody gives you straight answers the

526
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,609
only one that gave me a straight answer

527
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:19,839
was superior solve unless he's like I

528
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:21,668
want my full spectrum

529
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,319
I want the whole taste of the plant of

530
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:25,330
all of the hash that I'm getting and I

531
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:27,158
want it all mixed together so is it

532
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:30,369
consistent what you're getting out of

533
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:31,899
each spectrum like the 40 to 50 the 50

534
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,859
to settle I don't separate them because

535
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:34,839
then you're just wasting your time

536
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:37,288
pulling bag after bag after bag I know

537
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:40,628
but just to understand for like

538
00:23:37,288 --> 00:23:43,179
educational purposes like to like try

539
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:44,888
the 40 and be like okay I understand

540
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:46,750
what I'm getting but then you got the

541
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:49,628
that but that's all based on different

542
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:52,240
bags like his bags that he has he does a

543
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:56,558
different size some other bags go 40 to

544
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:59,079
70 40 to 104 you know it's like who

545
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:00,099
knows purse train exactly what heads are

546
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:02,980
there were correct heads that were

547
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:04,240
supposed to be smoking I don't the

548
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,778
amount of time that that would take to

549
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,250
figure out it's not possibly we haven't

550
00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:10,990
created a device that could figure it

551
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,609
out I don't think so I don't know of one

552
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,558
you know I mean I'd love to have that

553
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:16,178
but it doesn't exist so that's why

554
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:17,528
scientific now that's what I'm saying

555
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:19,240
I'm like I'm trying to break this down

556
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:22,898
yeah it's basically thinking about the

557
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:26,079
different bands right different sizes

558
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:29,288
what's what from a terpene standpoint a

559
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:31,058
cannabinoid standpoint other compounds

560
00:24:29,288 --> 00:24:32,259
like and then what effect each of those

561
00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:35,740
hasn't because you're marrying them

562
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:38,169
which I love I want the planet full but

563
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,019
I want full spectrum too I'd also like

564
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:42,669
to understand what the different bands

565
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:45,849
do whether it's how they make you feel

566
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:47,320
personally and personally from all the

567
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:48,339
experience that I've gathered as much as

568
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,038
I've done this and all the people that

569
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:54,908
I've smoked hash with it does give you a

570
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:56,980
little bit different high that that that

571
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:57,940
90 to 120 you it gives you a little bit

572
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,409
different height but that's before

573
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,788
pressing it if you were to press it it's

574
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:02,919
it's the same thing it just looks better

575
00:25:00,788 --> 00:25:04,058
it comes out like white you know what I

576
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,210
mean that's all it is and that's just a

577
00:25:04,058 --> 00:25:10,648
color thing and that's all mental right

578
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:12,970
I mean people are see are seeing Brown

579
00:25:10,648 --> 00:25:14,199
BHO and now it looks gold and now

580
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:18,038
everyone's like oh my god it's the best

581
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,298
it's like no you just you can do

582
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:21,460
anything different you know you

583
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:22,538
same thing with distillate it's sludge

584
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,058
you just took

585
00:25:22,538 --> 00:25:27,069
you just took raw sludge and you

586
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:30,220
filtered it down and you used a rotovap

587
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:31,359
and you and now it looks like distillate

588
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,250
and it's clear and you can put it in a

589
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:36,368
pen and smoke it but is it good

590
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:39,009
no it's not good I want I want what I

591
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,928
want my whole plant I like traditional

592
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:43,139
that's what I'm saying our long science

593
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:45,340
aside I wanted a making hash

594
00:25:43,138 --> 00:25:49,178
traditionally with good product it just

595
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:51,548
naturally occurs it happens and just

596
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:53,710
happens you have good trim like this

597
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:54,940
right here you get a gray hash yeah

598
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,250
there's nothing about it all comes

599
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:01,960
together right yeah good bags help too

600
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:05,048
you know traditional bob ways it just

601
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:09,100
happens and it's the best tradition the

602
00:26:05,048 --> 00:26:13,960
best ritual and it just if it's there

603
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:15,099
it's gonna come I always says and then

604
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:24,548
you have other people that are like man

605
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:26,829
I love finger love it I love it all I

606
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:28,868
still smoke weed out of the bong you

607
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:30,759
know what I mean like I'm not like what

608
00:26:28,868 --> 00:26:32,859
what was funny was when I was talking to

609
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:35,378
cam he was like yeah I don't smoke the

610
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:37,959
flower I was like really he doesn't

611
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:40,689
smoke flower I know and I was like next

612
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,028
time you harvest can you save me some of

613
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:45,548
your flower because he just I've never

614
00:26:43,028 --> 00:26:46,839
seen any of his flower yeah that's crazy

615
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:47,888
that you even mentioned that now that

616
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:50,138
now that I think about him like I've

617
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:53,678
never seen any of his flower he just

618
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:55,689
turns it all he's in and I told him that

619
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,360
he dated himself as being super young

620
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:00,278
because he's super young yeah he's like

621
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,888
why would I want to roll joints and

622
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:05,440
smoke flower when I can make it even

623
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:08,079
cleaner that shit I gotta let it cool

624
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,759
down give me a sec it's timing it out

625
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,990
yeah how many more a second we got seven

626
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,990
we're good we're good this is a

627
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:40,659
yeah that's delicious I love it when it

628
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:44,259
comes out good the real technique I've

629
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:45,580
noticed is everyone can wash it everyone

630
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:49,898
can put it on a tray and put it in a

631
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:52,720
freeze dryer everyone can stick it in a

632
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:54,699
bag and press it and have it come out on

633
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,278
parchment but what you do after that is

634
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,139
the real the real test of how well it's

635
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,839
gonna come out you need to be patient

636
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:04,000
you need to leave it in a jar

637
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,428
you need to let it cure and do its thing

638
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,259
for a little bit some strains are harder

639
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:09,580
than others they're like like I can't

640
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:10,538
even get in there with a chisel when

641
00:28:09,579 --> 00:28:15,638
it's cold right

642
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:20,679
like which what give examples for

643
00:28:15,638 --> 00:28:21,599
example this Wi-Fi right here looks all

644
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:23,769
nice and buttery

645
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,869
not before I whipped it I couldn't even

646
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:28,659
get in there I had to actually set it on

647
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:30,489
a heat mat for like 20-30 minutes just

648
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:32,769
to get it malleable so I can get in

649
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:36,519
there and break it up it was so hard

650
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:40,480
like I never see anybody's hash turn out

651
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:42,278
like that I don't I've had a lot of

652
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,380
people just telling me like whatever

653
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:46,808
you're doing keep it up I'm like I'm

654
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:52,899
trying I'm trying I'm trying real hard

655
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:55,019
so oh I don't think all of it will come

656
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,018
off

657
00:28:56,409 --> 00:29:05,740
was there a can of butane everyone

658
00:29:01,288 --> 00:29:07,919
thought I brought one well we're good

659
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,919
for now

660
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:37,699
I don't know if you recognize the logo

661
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:39,169
it's an old no-smoking logo from like

662
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,150
the Northeast they have them a lot in

663
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:42,559
like Washington and it'll have a puffin

664
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,548
but it says no puffins like you're not

665
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,069
allowed to puff and they'll be like a

666
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:48,940
red line going through it and I was just

667
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:48,939
like man that's such a good idea

668
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:53,869
very cool

669
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:55,669
hash has come such a long way like when

670
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:57,769
I first started making hash thought 20

671
00:29:55,669 --> 00:30:02,350
years ago I started making it from my

672
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:05,569
mom I'd cancer and we used to make this

673
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:09,109
like full Mel black hash and then we'd

674
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:11,329
make this blondes and the 73 micron is

675
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:37,759
so flaky and good we should be about

676
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:44,230
good to go yeah it tastes good yeah it's

677
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:49,548
