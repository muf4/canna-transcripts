important and timely topic this joint

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,689
informational hearing will be the first

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,058
of two hearings on the subject of e

20
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,589
cigarettes and vaping today's hearing

21
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:48,808
will provide an overview of the issues

22
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,120
related to vaping including the health

23
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:52,679
effects and regulatory landscape with

and state government regulators the

27
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,599
hearing will also look into the growing

28
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,030
popularity of e-cigarettes and vaping

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,780
examine the overall impact on youth and

30
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,579
general consumers ecig arete sand vaping

31
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,320
devices with seven billion dollars in

32
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,408
annual sales have become part of a daily

33
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,298
life for millions of Americans vaping

34
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,090
has risen dramatically in popularity

35
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:24,270
around the world from 7 million users in

36
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:26,159
2011 to over 35 million users today as

37
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:29,368
this happens traditional tobacco smoking

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,540
rates continue to decline however recent

39
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:32,459
studies have found that more than half

40
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,189
of American adult East cigarette users

41
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,048
are under 35 years of age fueling

42
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:40,349
concern about the popularity of vaping

43
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,479
among young people youth access and uses

44
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:44,519
skyrocketed with the preparation of

45
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,250
flavors attractive to the teenager such

46
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:50,489
as Bazooka Joe bubblegum cotton candy

47
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,200
and gummy bears federal statistics show

48
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,709
a significant increase in vaping among

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,270
teens between 2017 and 2018 more than

50
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,759
one in four high school students

51
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:03,359
reported vaping in the past month up

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,159
from one in five students in 2018 Issa

53
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,718
Viet use among middle students has also

54
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,270
middle-school students has also

55
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,098
increased federal health officials are

56
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,120
calling this troubling trend an epidemic

57
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:16,000
and fear that teenagers who vape

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,830
we'll eventually start smoking but now

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,479
as a legislature we're not only faced

60
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,159
with the issues of rapid rise and teen

61
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,789
the e-cigarette use but a national

62
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:25,840
outbreak of mysterious lung injury cases

63
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:28,929
associated with the use of vaping

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,640
products the CDC now reports seven

65
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,099
thirteen hundred vaping illnesses in at

66
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:36,009
least 26 nationwide linked to the use of

67
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:39,280
e-cigarettes and vaping there were no

68
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:41,739
more than 200 new cases reported just

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,939
last week and the CDC told Congress this

70
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:44,319
morning that these statistics are

71
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:46,389
unfortunately expected to increase

72
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:50,108
considerably in the near future

73
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:54,608
the median age of deceased patients was

74
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:57,400
49 years old the range was from 17 to 75

75
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:59,680
years old according to recent findings

76
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,260
by the CDC most of the patients impacted

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,230
by these illnesses reported using THC

78
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:06,548
containing products suggesting THC

79
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:09,280
products are playing a role in these

80
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:11,260
illnesses that said some patients have

81
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,539
reported using both THC products and

82
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:15,969
nicotine products as well as a smaller

83
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:19,120
number reported using only nicotine

84
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:21,699
products similar testing on the samples

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,200
collected or received by the FDA shows a

86
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:25,509
variety of products or product

87
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,888
components with different ingredients or

88
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:29,759
delivery systems making this

89
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:31,480
investigation especially challenging

90
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,009
authorities are still gathering

91
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,289
information but according to recent

92
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:37,120
reports patients with the conditions

93
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:41,698
seem to be overwhelmingly male around

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,469
70% with 80% of patients under age 35

95
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,840
according to the CDC their investigation

96
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:48,818
is ongoing and no single brand product

97
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,098
substance or additive has been linked to

98
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:52,418
all cases while the cause of the

99
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,969
outbreak remains unknown

100
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:58,329
the CDC warns against the use of any

101
00:03:54,969 --> 00:04:00,400
e-cigarette or any vaping product aside

102
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:02,379
from the recently illnesses outbreak the

103
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,480
long-term health effects of continued

104
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:06,280
East cigarette and vaping use remain

105
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,959
unknown as the scientific community

106
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,560
continues to study the health hazards

107
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,810
posed by these technology bottom-line we

108
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,489
still do not have all the answers but as

109
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,168
a legislature we must get a grasp on the

110
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:19,269
multiple cases surrounding e cigarettes

111
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:21,728
and vaping we must consider the health

112
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,250
and safety concerns impacts on youth

113
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,199
black market enforcement issues in areas

114
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,389
of an adequate state

115
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,039
regulation and oversight we need to

116
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,990
identify where existing efforts have

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,819
failed and discuss expert

118
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,740
recommendations to reverse the deeply

119
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,439
concerning epidemic abuse e-cigarette

120
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,810
use and vaping news impacting children's

121
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,730
and families across California today

122
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,829
will serve as an opportunity to

123
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,509
establish consistent set of facts so

124
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:47,609
that we're all operating off the same

125
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:49,620
set of facts and highlight the best

126
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,350
available information we currently have

127
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:57,569
I would now ask chairman lo for his

128
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:58,980
opening remarks mr. chair and again

129
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,040
thank you very much to the collective

130
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,970
work of our respective committees and

131
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,230
forming this and putting this together I

132
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,820
know that this is just the beginning of

133
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,040
the conversation that we have to be as

134
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,079
responsive to consumer protection and

135
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,840
the constituencies that we represent

136
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,569
similarly within the respect of business

137
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:20,039
and professions you hit it on the head

138
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:21,930
mr. chair but in regards to the state of

139
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,930
California in cannabis and I'm part of

140
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,420
the crisis on vaping is with respect to

141
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,579
the failure of the regulatory system to

142
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,770
which the legal access to quality

143
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,349
regulated cannabis products throughout

144
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:36,689
the state is relatively limited in fact

145
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,000
as we well know roughly 3/4 of cities

146
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:41,399
and counties have been licensed cannabis

147
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,100
retailers seating those areas to

148
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:47,509
unlicensed unregulated untaxed and

149
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,830
untested illicit market operators

150
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:51,899
similarly we also know that the

151
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:54,990
identifying root causes and impacts of

152
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:57,329
these illness will have an impact on

153
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,689
those responsible actors within the

154
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:02,519
legal and the illicit market and we need

155
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:05,459
to hold them respectfully to account

156
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:08,039
that being said we are looking at what

157
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:10,289
to do to protect individuals in the

158
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,420
marketplace and average Californians it

159
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,550
may also be of consideration that we

160
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,680
explore a moratorium on additives which

161
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:20,520
appears to reflect industry's best

162
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,129
practices we as a state or a port of

163
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,680
entry for a lot of vaping supplies of

164
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:28,709
the United States and I know that we

165
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,680
have a particular important role with

166
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:33,870
respect to the industry as a large state

167
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,870
and the nation's supply chain of the

168
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,550
illicit marketplace in both cannabis and

169
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,840
nicotine vaping products so

170
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,600
I very much look forward to the

171
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,769
testimony from our public

172
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,689
representatives and and look forward to

173
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:51,719
the continued conversation thank you

174
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:53,759
very much to the chairs here and I think

175
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,610
chairman gray actually framed this

176
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,029
discussion very very well as a start as

177
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:02,400
a starting point so I just want to hear

178
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:04,169
from our experts this afternoon but you

179
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,229
have some comments I think the explosion

180
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,730
in popularity of e-cigarettes here at

181
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,009
ISA current use has been a problem for

182
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:13,770
some time with staggering numbers of

183
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,300
youth becoming addicted to nicotine in

184
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,620
the last several weeks it's become all

185
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,000
too clear that we have a much bigger

186
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,579
problem on our hands with the outbreak

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,040
of lung illness and injuries and death

188
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:24,990
and the questions around exactly what's

189
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,670
causing this my colleagues and I are

190
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,980
committed to working on all aspects of

191
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,270
this issue as you've heard this hearing

192
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,390
is just a first step

193
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:36,299
I break this into two different in my

194
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:38,039
mind the way I look at this and and

195
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,620
there are many aspects of this I am

196
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,629
concerned about one the number of young

197
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,920
people that are starting today period

198
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:48,839
whether it's nicotine or THC

199
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,310
number two the illness that we're facing

200
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,889
the public health crisis that we're

201
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:55,740
facing there and so I think as we start

202
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:58,829
hearing about this I think those are

203
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,230
separate issues in many ways there is

204
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:04,279
some crossover but that's how my my

205
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:07,379
weird compartmentalised mind works so

206
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:09,839
with that I'm happy to introduce our

207
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:14,310
first panel so I'd ask them to please

208
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:16,589
come up dr. Eliza Tong and Kimberly Vega

209
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,480
Dorie who will give us an overview of

210
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:20,789
the vaping and East cigarette industry

211
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:25,220
and discuss the prevalence of products

212
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,220
use thank you in advance

213
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:35,279
thank you dear Assembly members my name

214
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,899
is Eliza Tong and I'm speaking today as

215
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,120
a practicing physician and tobacco

216
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,009
research expert for identification

217
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,470
purposes I worked at University of

218
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:45,149
California Davis today miss Homer vaca

219
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,470
Dori from the California Youth Advocacy

220
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,789
network and I will share some brief

221
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,830
background information about

222
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:52,349
understanding the new vaping epidemic

223
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:54,030
for California the word epidemic has

224
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,070
been used for years to describe how

225
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:57,089
tobacco is the leading preventable cause

226
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,220
of death

227
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,930
now the word epidemic is being used for

228
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,180
vaping with the sharp rise in youth

229
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:04,949
rates the massive proliferation of

230
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:06,779
products and shocking new cases of

231
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,670
vaping associated pulmonary injury and

232
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,079
deaths first I'll highlight some key

233
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:11,969
points for the regulatory and health

234
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,680
landscape next miss homer of agador ii

235
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,639
will highlight the impact on youth and

236
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:20,219
young adults this is what I call my

237
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,289
greatest hits slides but looking back

238
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,279
lessons from the past about marketing

239
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:25,949
and science are important for

240
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,409
understanding what is going on today so

241
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,030
in the 50s and 60s when scientific

242
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:31,219
studies that first started linking

243
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:33,659
smoking cigarettes to lung cancer

244
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,090
emerged the tobacco company started

245
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,009
running these historic advertorials

246
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,990
called a frank statement to cigarette

247
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:42,149
smokers to create doubt by disputing the

248
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,370
study findings saying experiments with

249
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,289
mice were not regarded as conclusive for

250
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,350
lung cancer they also ran ads showing

251
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:50,639
doctors here promoting products they

252
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,320
also say that they believe their

253
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,879
products were not injurious to health

254
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,850
and that they would cooperate for public

255
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,500
health and then growing over time all

256
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,960
the scientific evidence 10 years later

257
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,480
it took the first landmark surgeon

258
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,180
general's report in 1964 to synthesize

259
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,850
all that biological and epidemiological

260
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:11,849
evidence concluding that smoking does

261
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,560
indeed cause lung cancer subsequently

262
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,000
the US Congress adopted laws for health

263
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:16,829
warnings on cigarette packages and

264
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,169
advertising bans in the broadcast media

265
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,730
however tobacco control work continues

266
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:23,729
today as the Centers for Disease Control

267
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,800
States due to the quote the addictive

268
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:30,480
nature of tobacco and powerful economic

269
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:33,089
forces promoting its use now in the 70s

270
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,129
80s the next couple decades the industry

271
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:38,040
started trying to develop and market new

272
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:39,179
products as less harmful to smokers but

273
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,699
it was actually the evidence that

274
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:43,389
non-smokers could also be harmed that

275
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,890
had the most impact

276
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,929
some folks in the room may not have been

277
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:48,610
alive during this time but that

278
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:51,009
advertisement on the left-hand side with

279
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:54,250
the disco lady shows that the industry

280
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:55,659
sold low tar cigarettes mild light ultra

281
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,149
light cigarettes has less harmful

282
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:59,909
because we knew that tar caused cancer

283
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:02,409
when it was painted on the backs of mice

284
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:04,569
maybe this was a way to get less cancer

285
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:07,179
however these cigarettes were also

286
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,920
machine tested for lower levels of tar

287
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:12,039
but that's not really what happened when

288
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:13,719
people actually use these products so it

289
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,099
did not actually reduce the health risks

290
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,860
of smoking and it took us years to

291
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,330
figure that out so in real life smokers

292
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,440
could change the way they smoke because

293
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,110
they were trying to get a lot more

294
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,990
nicotine and they could actually get the

295
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,470
same amount of chemicals or even more

296
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:32,860
than the machine-based numbers suggested

297
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:34,360
so as time went on in the mid 1980s the

298
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,730
Surgeon General came out with a report

299
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,710
on the growing again the growing

300
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,659
scientific evidence that secondhand

301
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,700
smoke exposure caused harm to

302
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:45,610
non-smokers and in fact cause lung

303
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:49,180
cancer this evidence helped stimulate a

304
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,889
broad array of change from if some of

305
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:52,750
you in the room may remember no smoking

306
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:54,250
sections which people jokingly say is

307
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,009
like having a no peeing section in a

308
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,440
pool because it doesn't really work -

309
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:02,049
now what we have for smoke-free policies

310
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,350
that protect non-smokers so in

311
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:08,169
California we are very fortunate at 1999

312
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,089
with our first tobacco taxed that we

313
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:12,099
created a comprehensive tobacco control

314
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:14,500
program to change social norms around

315
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,139
smoking reduce product availability and

316
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,269
protect public health instead of only

317
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:21,519
focusing on treating individual smokers

318
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:23,139
this approach has been widely recognized

319
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,549
internationally as one of the greatest

320
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:29,919
public health successes to this day now

321
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:32,649
the 90s to the 2000s were marked by

322
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,539
lawsuits whistleblowers helped bring

323
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:36,100
internal tobacco industry documents to

324
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:37,779
light that were previously protected

325
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,000
through attorney-client privilege

326
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,588
these internal document documents were

327
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,779
in stark contrast to the picture in the

328
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:45,760
upper right where the tobacco industry

329
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:47,379
CEOs at the time testified in front of

330
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,080
Congress I believe nicotine is not

331
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:52,299
addictive subsequently the state

332
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,860
attorney general's sued for Medicaid

333
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:56,079
costs for tobacco related disease

334
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,379
leading to what is called as the master

335
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,650
cell

336
00:12:56,379 --> 00:13:01,960
agreement at the federal level in 2006

337
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:03,730
the US Department of Justice ruled that

338
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,590
the industry violated the racketeering

339
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,330
and corrupt influence organizations law

340
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,820
concluding that the industry quote

341
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,889
continues to engage in and execute a

342
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,879
50-year scheme to defraud the public on

343
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:17,500
health effects and marketing to children

344
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,939
and then four years afterwards the

345
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,250
industry argued against federal

346
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:24,880
penalties and it took over a decade

347
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:27,519
later in 2017 for them to finally air

348
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,350
quote corrective court-ordered

349
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,169
statements which some of which are seen

350
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,370
on the lower right and so these ran kind

351
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:35,589
of in late-night TV

352
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,539
black and white there's you can still

353
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,160
see some of them on YouTube however

354
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:42,129
studies showed that only forty percent

355
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:45,219
of US adults were actually aware of

356
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:46,710
these corrective statements but the

357
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,899
range of what they had the state

358
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:53,200
included acknowledgment that nicotine

359
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:54,669
was indeed addictive low tar light ultra

360
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,070
light mild and natural cigarettes

361
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:59,219
actually lacked health benefits and were

362
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,180
deceptively marketed as less harmful

363
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,610
cigarettes for a minute related to

364
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:05,319
maximize nicotine delivery and that

365
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:09,250
there is no safe level of exposure to

366
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,290
secondhand smoke so now we come to the

367
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,029
Food and Drug Administration in 2009

368
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:15,339
they were given authority to regulate

369
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:17,679
tobacco products and this included the

370
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,530
manufacturer distribution and marketing

371
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,629
of tobacco products so FDA is supposed

372
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:24,100
to approve that new products are not

373
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:26,470
worse than cigarettes before they go to

374
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,420
market they're also supposed to approve

375
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,930
any marked products making cessation or

376
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:34,360
reduced harm claims or go through their

377
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:37,120
office as well and products like Jill

378
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,440
have not done for example flavors and

379
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,379
cigarettes have already been banned

380
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,960
through this regulation except for

381
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:46,360
menthol cigarettes due to industry

382
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,610
pressure however this led to the rise of

383
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,740
new products that were not quote

384
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,840
cigarettes some you can see on the far

385
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,269
upper right that did not have to follow

386
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,700
rules made for cigarettes with a brown

387
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,669
paper wrapping you could suddenly have a

388
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,230
cigarette or little cigar and you don't

389
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:04,110
have to follow the flavor or packaging

390
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,950
rules that were made for cigarettes

391
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,500
electronic cigarettes were on the rise

392
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,210
as well but it took years for the FDA to

393
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,879
finalize what's called the

394
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:16,300
deeming rule to begin regulation that

395
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:19,330
was in 2016 and the FDA delayed

396
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:21,669
implementation of that for until 2022

397
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,620
for manufacturers to submit information

398
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:25,689
and improve their products but now with

399
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:30,459
public pressure as you all may well know

400
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:32,050
this has been moved up to next year this

401
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,338
one's a little bit complicated but let

402
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:35,588
me walk you through this so throughout

403
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:37,300
the years California's success story is

404
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:39,130
that cigarette smoking prevalence rates

405
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:42,039
have declined faster than the rest of

406
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:43,899
the country but the news now is that

407
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,208
vaping and marijuana use rates are

408
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:47,950
rising especially in young adults so

409
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:50,169
this data focuses on the general adult

410
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,970
population as the summer of agador he's

411
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:54,338
going to describe youth and young adults

412
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,100
since California has a tobacco 21 law

413
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:59,260
not to sell to persons under 21 so the

414
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,720
bar chart shows on the far right that in

415
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:05,409
2017 our California prevalence for any

416
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,240
tobacco use was almost 15% on the far

417
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:10,240
left you'll see cigarettes that's 10%

418
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,950
and only 3% for vaping that little bar

419
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,159
the second bar from the left

420
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:17,259
however younger people who are aged 21

421
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:21,490
to 29 years old they've ate that much

422
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:24,580
higher rates with 11% in 2017 and 13% in

423
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:27,278
2018 and users may use or switch across

424
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,990
multiple tobacco products and in the US

425
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:32,110
over half of e cigarette users are

426
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:35,409
current smokers marijuana use on the

427
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,720
right in adults especially young people

428
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:39,629
is also rising with over 1 and for young

429
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,190
adults over 21

430
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:44,950
similarly Co use of marijuana and

431
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:47,580
tobacco is rising now with 1 in 8 young

432
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,580
adults over 21

433
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:53,170
so with this low federal regulatory

434
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,209
landscape for vaping it's difficult to

435
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:57,819
know what's actually in these cigarette

436
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:59,409
products and their aerosol at despite

437
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,839
what they're labeled as this is a

438
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:03,519
graphic from the CDC where they note

439
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,558
that products that are marketed as even

440
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,318
having no nicotine have been found to

441
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:10,480
contain nicotine so studies to date show

442
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,970
that this aerosol is not water vapor

443
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,890
which is what many people think in the

444
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,480
public instead this aerosol as a

445
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,939
chemical mixture that can contain

446
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,650
propylene glycol volatile organic

447
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:23,450
compounds carcinogens heavy metals

448
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:26,660
flavors and ultrafine particles

449
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:28,190
ultrafine particles for example can are

450
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,380
just some of the substances that can

451
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,029
have immediate harmful effects so all of

452
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,920
us who've experienced the California

453
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:36,379
smoky fires for example or freeway air

454
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,880
pollution they're those things are the

455
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,470
ultrafine particles are known to cause

456
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,440
inflammation that's important for heart

457
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,329
and lung function in particular even if

458
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,370
some products contain less of these

459
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:48,799
harmful ingredients the CDC has

460
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:51,859
underscored this does not mean it is a

461
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,750
safe product there isn't in fact no safe

462
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:56,659
tobacco product we've already learned

463
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,549
that low tar cigarettes as defined by a

464
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,320
machine doesn't mean it's a safer

465
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:02,240
product we are still learning how

466
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:07,159
heating and inhaling chemicals in these

467
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,779
products that affect the human body so

468
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,060
despite having been banned in cigarettes

469
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:12,980
flavors and their marketing of flavored

470
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:14,869
tobacco products are concerning for the

471
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,509
rise and use and their harmful health

472
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:20,149
effects so just a couple examples here

473
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:22,069
some menthol has been most notably been

474
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:25,070
targeted towards the african-american

475
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:27,710
community contributing to tobacco

476
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:29,869
related health disparities beyond being

477
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,430
just a flavor preference the growing

478
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:33,559
evidence about menthol is that it's

479
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:36,590
numbing properties make it easier easier

480
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:37,970
to initiate and inhale its chemical

481
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:39,259
properties make it harder to quit

482
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,450
because it's actually working on the

483
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:44,059
nicotine receptors and and there's an

484
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:46,309
Associated carcinogen with these oils

485
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:48,440
and called polygons and there there's a

486
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:50,000
recent JAMA article that says there are

487
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,039
levels that are higher way higher and

488
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,190
ecig a' Rhett's then actually what's in

489
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:56,629
regular cigarettes or also fda levels

490
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:00,320
for food and it's been banned as a food

491
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,780
additive as a synthetic chemical other

492
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,250
flavors that are appealing to children

493
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:06,379
include fruit candy or sweet flavors

494
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,609
that has been noted but these have

495
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,280
safety standards that are meant for

496
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:11,809
eating not for inhaling growing evidence

497
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:14,000
shows that these flavors by themselves

498
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:15,740
and in combination can harm health such

499
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,690
as with lung function blood vessel cells

500
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:21,319
and white blood cells which is important

501
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:23,360
for your immunity diacetyl which is

502
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:25,069
found in three quarters of liquids is

503
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,709
associated with bronchiolitis obliterans

504
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:29,720
and irreversible lung disease described

505
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:32,350
in workers from buttered popcorn factory

506
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,350
factories

507
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:38,700
so the high potency of nicotine levels

508
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:41,220
and in marijuana's psychoactive

509
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,739
component THC and these vaping products

510
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,600
is really alarming in fact the Surgeon

511
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:47,608
General has released warnings to young

512
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,048
adults for both of these components

513
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:52,069
because the developing brain is

514
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:55,470
especially vulnerable through age 25

515
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:57,589
nicotine itself is not harmless with

516
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,450
potential for cardiovascular effects

517
00:19:57,589 --> 00:20:03,209
seizures and even poisonings it's used

518
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,889
in pesticides with vaping new nicotine

519
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,749
salts and liquids have high

520
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:08,729
bioavailability and are more easily

521
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:11,339
absorbed with less aerosol than regular

522
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,108
cigarettes and regular cigarettes the

523
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:15,928
industry had used ammonia to basically

524
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:18,599
freebase on higher levels of nicotine to

525
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:20,669
be absorbed in your body

526
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:23,128
in fact with that diagram on the right

527
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:25,769
it is from the CDC and it shows one

528
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:27,748
small jewel pod of ejuice contains at

529
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:29,519
least as much nicotine as one pack of

530
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:31,399
cigarettes but again as noted it may be

531
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:35,159
even higher depending on how you use it

532
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:38,459
newer products that you have even higher

533
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:40,739
eliquid concentrations of nicotine maybe

534
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,389
from refillables and as more people vape

535
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,308
marijuana the Surgeon General has put

536
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:45,778
out a warning that THC concentrations

537
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:48,269
have increased threefold over the past

538
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:50,308
couple decades so these health effects

539
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:52,499
of vaping these high potency nicotine

540
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:54,480
and marijuana products including in

541
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:56,940
combination and how heating might be

542
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,429
different than burning this is all

543
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,109
learning for everyone including the

544
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:05,119
medical profession and this is an

545
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:05,118
ongoing natural experiment in humans so

546
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:10,798
as mentioned now this past summer with

547
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,739
the vaping associated pulmonary injury

548
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:16,589
all this combination of the rise in

549
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:19,139
vaping nicotine and marijuana has

550
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:21,209
brought us to this stage so every week

551
00:21:19,138 --> 00:21:25,048
the CDC is reporting more cases so as

552
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:28,288
mentioned earlier 1,300 cases over a

553
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:29,940
hundred cases in California 26 deaths

554
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:32,179
including three in California King

555
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,308
County Tulare County in LA County and

556
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:37,470
this isn't just a youth problem because

557
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:40,589
the median age of death is 49 years old

558
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,179
and the range is 17 to 75 and again the

559
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:44,089
CDC states no single product or

560
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,990
substance has been linked to all cases

561
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:47,730
although most reported they

562
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,278
teach see it's only about a third

563
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:52,558
exclusively and well over half reported

564
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:54,509
vaping nicotine so the CDC has come out

565
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,700
to say to the public people should not

566
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:59,028
use vaping products with THC consider

567
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,350
that as well for nicotine products also

568
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:03,269
other recommendations are not to buy

569
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:05,759
vaping products off the street or modify

570
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:07,379
or add substances however many people

571
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,879
get their products socially from others

572
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,070
so it's hard to tell

573
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,010
regardless of the investigation the CDC

574
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:16,678
emphasizes that young people pregnant

575
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:19,048
women and never should not vape there is

576
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,940
no safe tobacco product use and THC is

577
00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:23,460
associated with a wide range of health

578
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,659
effects especially the users and we're

579
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:29,909
still learning about that to this day

580
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:31,830
it's worth noting also that secondhand

581
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:34,559
smoke exposure and non-smokers has

582
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:37,500
become an increasingly important issue

583
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,298
so the CDC image on the Left describes

584
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,190
how the Surgeon General has concluded

585
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:43,558
that aerosol from vaping can contain

586
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,690
harmful substances and use in public

587
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:48,658
places undermines existing protections

588
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:50,278
for non users back in 2006 there was a

589
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,020
certain generals report that concluded

590
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:55,558
there is no risk-free level of exposure

591
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:57,000
to secondhand smoke and non-users this

592
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:58,980
is especially important for heart and

593
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,710
lung health and on the right hand side

594
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,778
is an image from California's tobacco

595
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,360
control programs new secondhand dangers

596
00:23:03,778 --> 00:23:07,740
campaign and where they describe over

597
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:11,009
the past two years secondhand marijuana

598
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:14,669
exposures increased by 86% secondhand

599
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:16,470
vape exposures increased by 67% and it's

600
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:18,929
worth noting also that 30 percent of

601
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:21,690
California youth in 2018 also report

602
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:23,250
exposure to secondhand smoke vapor and

603
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,570
marijuana so these smoked in

604
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,460
tobacco-free policies that protect

605
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:30,960
public health now need to consider

606
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:33,298
vaping including marijuana so wrapping

607
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,429
up smoking cessation has a strong

608
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:37,139
evidence base that it works counseling

609
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:40,169
support and medications can help people

610
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,850
quit for good however it's because of

611
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,770
the highly addictive nature of nicotine

612
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:45,629
it can take at least eight to twelve

613
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:48,808
really good attempts for someone to quit

614
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:50,278
for good and providers are told they

615
00:23:48,808 --> 00:23:52,528
should ask about tobacco use and

616
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:54,480
exposure advised to quit and advise

617
00:23:52,528 --> 00:23:56,460
about health harms and refer to

618
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,349
counseling support and offer medications

619
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,710
we are still trying to learn what to do

620
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:01,779
about vaping

621
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:05,019
it's not even a requirement for us to

622
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:07,089
ask about vaping but our state quit line

623
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:10,180
now the California smokers helpline at

624
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:12,339
UC San Diego they have now stepped up as

625
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,440
our free statewide resource to help not

626
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:16,709
only help people quit smoking but also

627
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,570
with vaping and this includes for teens

628
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:22,509
there are seven fda-approved tobacco

629
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:24,009
cessation aids to assist with nicotine

630
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:25,779
withdrawal symptoms over two to three

631
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:28,329
months and most people are familiar with

632
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:29,529
the nicotine patch lozenge or gum but

633
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:31,659
there are also other faster-acting

634
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:33,519
modalities like the nasal spray and

635
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,140
inhaler none of which are meant to go

636
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,389
into your lungs this is like the back of

637
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,370
your throat and cheek absorption and

638
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,440
none of these are meant to be for

639
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:43,509
long-term either so when the u.s. ecig

640
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,460
arrests are not approved as a smoking

641
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:46,990
cessation aid as concluded by the US

642
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,299
Preventive Services Task Force which

643
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:51,819
reviews all the scientific evidence but

644
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:53,680
now our health systems and providers are

645
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:56,710
now challenged with figuring out how to

646
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,830
ask advise and treat people who vape and

647
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:02,829
to help people quit vaping for good so

648
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:05,079
with that I'll transition to misnomer

649
00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:07,329
Baga Dori thank you so much for the

650
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:08,859
opportunity to speak today my name is

651
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:10,659
Kim home Rebecca Dori and I'm with an

652
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:12,339
organization that works statewide on

653
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,080
tobacco control issues with youth and

654
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:15,789
young adults and we also work with all

655
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,099
of our colleges and universities in the

656
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:19,899
state on smoking tobacco-free policy

657
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,879
initiatives today I'm going to highlight

658
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,440
and summarize for you the national and

659
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,900
state data we have on youth and young

660
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,549
adult use I do want to note that this is

661
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,200
tobacco heavy because that's my area of

662
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:32,680
expertise but it's also what we have a

663
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,870
lot of research on so looking at current

664
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:38,289
use we know at the national level that

665
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:41,469
we saw our peak in youth vaping in 2015

666
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:44,649
and we started to go down in 2016 with a

667
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:46,450
slight uptick in 2017 much of this is

668
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,850
due to the types of devices that were

669
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,440
available on the market prior to the new

670
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:52,659
devices that we have we like to say

671
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,490
there were three types of products we

672
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,860
sig likes are the first they look just

673
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:59,230
like little cigarettes the second are

674
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:00,969
the vape pens which now we're hearing

675
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:04,089
from young people are really only being

676
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:05,740
used as wax pens to be THC solutions and

677
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:07,659
then the third were the mods and the

678
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,980
tanks and part of the challenges with

679
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,230
these products were they were not very

680
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,650
good at delivering nicotine solution and

681
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,299
so

682
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,490
individuals were not getting satiated

683
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:18,180
when using them and trying to use them

684
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,289
other than other tobacco products in

685
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,970
2018 that all changed with the

686
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,799
introduction of the new pod based

687
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,630
products there are two things that

688
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:27,279
change with these products the first was

689
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,930
the size of the device which is very

690
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,210
problematic for young people because

691
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,920
they're easy to hide and because they're

692
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,870
also smaller the batteries are smaller

693
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,670
there's less aerosol that is emitted

694
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:38,949
from them and so they're very very

695
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,300
difficult to detect the second was the

696
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,009
type of solutions that's in these

697
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,869
products so it's a nicotine salt

698
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:45,609
solution it's easier to consume and it's

699
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:47,769
significantly higher and nicotine

700
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:49,809
solutions than the other products before

701
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:51,250
these these are the products that young

702
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:52,779
people have been using and these are the

703
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,700
products that are responsible for this

704
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:57,490
epidemic that we are now recognizing at

705
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,740
the national level so within a one year

706
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:02,620
period we saw an increase of one and a

707
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,690
half million students youth students who

708
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:06,669
increase their use of these products

709
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:09,420
with vaping and the greatest increase

710
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:11,830
was seen among high school students

711
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,110
looking at the recent data that was

712
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:15,789
released from the national government

713
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:18,009
this is preliminary data and more will

714
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:19,960
be coming soon but it's showing that we

715
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:22,750
are continuing to see an increase in

716
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,299
youth vaping of tobacco products and so

717
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:27,819
in 2018 when the alarms went off we saw

718
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:29,500
an increase up to almost 21 percent that

719
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:31,839
has jumped again to nearly twenty eight

720
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,210
percent and this is past 30-day use so

721
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:37,539
this is not ever used this as regular

722
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:39,220
30-day use what's also troubling is the

723
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:42,029
types of products that young people are

724
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:44,829
using so we know in 2016 there were over

725
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:47,109
15,000 unique flavors of vaping devices

726
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:49,210
on the market and we know that young

727
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:52,179
people were most likely to use candy

728
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:53,860
flavored or fruit flavored but in 2019

729
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:57,549
we've seen a jump of young people using

730
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:58,959
mints and insulated products so we have

731
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:00,819
a lot to celebrate with our cigarette

732
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,079
smoking we've done some phenomenal work

733
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:06,519
to get us down to 2% it's a historic low

734
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:09,159
but that is not the same with all

735
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:12,250
tobacco products and so specifically

736
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,800
looking in California the data in 2018

737
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:17,650
which we saw as much as we're dealing

738
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,000
with right now data a year ago can be

739
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,670
archaic when we're dealing with this

740
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,039
problem but what we have is nearly 11

741
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:27,100
percent of teens reported past

742
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:28,750
they use vaping devices and you can see

743
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:30,189
with the yellow in this chart the

744
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,470
majority of the products that are being

745
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:38,230
used regardless of its vaping or another

746
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:39,880
tobacco product is a flavor product data

747
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,099
from the California student tobacco

748
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,500
survey also shows that youth use of

749
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:47,799
marijuana is high so there was not any

750
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,390
significant changes from 2016 to 2018 in

751
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:51,309
use but it's important to note that

752
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:53,710
marijuana use among teens is still

753
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:56,799
higher than tobacco use and also higher

754
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,059
than a cigarette use the survey the

755
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,879
questions that were asked on the survey

756
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:02,409
asked students who reported vaping what

757
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,400
types of products they vape tin they did

758
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:08,650
ask if they've eight THC solutions and

759
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:12,210
21% close to 22 percent of teens did

760
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:14,800
report vaping THC products in California

761
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,539
now looking at young adults we see a

762
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,029
similar trend and that cigarette smoking

763
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:21,430
is going down these cigarette use is

764
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:24,160
going up and marijuana use has gone up

765
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,570
significantly we again have been

766
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,910
successful in trying to reduce

767
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:30,609
combustible products but the same can't

768
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:32,230
be said for vaping devices what's

769
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:33,699
interesting and I've been working with

770
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,769
colleges and universities for over

771
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,049
eighteen years is that for a long time

772
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:40,629
we've been seeing the use of tobacco use

773
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:42,220
rates go down with college students so

774
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,680
we can predict that if somebody does not

775
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,180
go to college that their likelihood of

776
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,310
smoking cigarette is higher than

777
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,590
somebody who is in college now that has

778
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:52,869
been completely reversed by this trend

779
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:54,549
in vaping and so college students now

780
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:56,889
have significantly higher rates of

781
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:59,919
vaping nicotine solutions and vaping

782
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:03,100
marijuana products than individuals who

783
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:05,320
do not go to college one challenge with

784
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:06,909
this specifically too is that our

785
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:08,500
colleges and universities many in

786
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:11,259
California which are now smoking

787
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,539
tobacco-free have an influx of students

788
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:15,970
who are addicted to these products who

789
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:18,159
are now going to their campuses and our

790
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,900
need of support to help them quit and

791
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,000
they're going to smoke in tobacco-free

792
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,259
campuses but our K through 12 campuses

793
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,529
are smoking tobacco-free and young

794
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:28,420
people are still using these products so

795
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:30,460
when we look at literature specific to

796
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:33,789
why young people use tobacco products

797
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,990
and specifically vape we have evidence

798
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:36,430
that shows that young people of eight

799
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,839
because it's their norm

800
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,910
so if their friends are using these

801
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,589
products or they have family members who

802
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,750
use them they're more likely to use them

803
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:45,250
what's interesting is if you talk to a

804
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,799
young person if you talk to college

805
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,559
students to youth their perception of

806
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:53,799
what the use is is significantly higher

807
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,480
than what it actually is and so that

808
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:58,059
makes them believe that it's completely

809
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,410
normalized to use these products with

810
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:01,389
interesting many of the young people

811
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:03,009
that we work with have not been exposed

812
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:05,740
to secondhand smoke indoors they've

813
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:08,379
grown up in a smoke-free California so

814
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,380
the norm of cigarette smoking is not

815
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,120
there but we've completely reversed that

816
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,100
with vaping because young people are

817
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,539
seeing it and they think everybody does

818
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:18,429
it if you ever talked to a teen and you

819
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:22,119
ask them do you know people that they

820
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:24,279
say yes everybody is vaping also with

821
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:26,199
flavors so flavors was a high indicator

822
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:29,619
of why people are using these products

823
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,000
to experiment with flavors and when we

824
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:32,500
asked we do focus groups with young

825
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,990
people and we asked them about the

826
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,670
products that they use and all of the

827
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,650
young people we talked to say they use

828
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:41,110
products because of the flavors they

829
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:43,090
taste good and flavors in the vaping

830
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:46,149
devices but also in combustible products

831
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:48,069
it masks the harshness of the smoke and

832
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:50,920
it makes them believe that it's not as

833
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:52,809
bad we've had unflavored cigarette

834
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,850
products since 2009 with the exception

835
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:56,470
of mentholated products and so there's a

836
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:58,419
lot of misperceptions around the harms

837
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,069
of many of these products and a

838
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,289
cigarette czar also included in that

839
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:04,059
it's important to note as well that when

840
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:07,720
we did our focus groups with youth while

841
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:08,829
we talk primarily about tobacco every

842
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,980
conversation we have with the young

843
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:14,049
person wraps back into marijuana and

844
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:16,750
while young people have mixed feelings

845
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:18,039
on the safety of e-cigarettes the

846
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,170
majority of young people we talk to

847
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:24,279
believe that marijuana was completely

848
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:27,550
safe so another reason for this is the

849
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:30,869
access to tobacco products so when jool

850
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:33,490
started to become popular in 2017-2018

851
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:35,319
the truth initiative dead national study

852
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,120
specific to individuals who had reported

853
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:38,980
dual use to find out where they were

854
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,000
getting these products and as you can

855
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,710
see the majority of young people

856
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,480
reported that they were getting them in

857
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,579
the retail environment and getting them

858
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,360
locally and so when we look here in

859
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:49,369
California our biggest offenders

860
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,500
retailers are selling tobacco products

861
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:53,000
are actually the tobacco and vape shops

862
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,369
where young people are not allowed in

863
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:00,048
and yet they are selling at rates higher

864
00:32:55,369 --> 00:33:01,969
than levels of any other retailer so

865
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:03,319
some of the concerns that we have from

866
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,750
an organization that works with young

867
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:07,189
people the first is we have extensive

868
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,690
data to show that young people who

869
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:11,029
experiment with vaping or young people

870
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:13,670
who do vape are significantly more

871
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:15,259
likely to become tobacco users use the

872
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,990
combustible products that they have not

873
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:20,690
been using but will start using or use

874
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,190
marijuana products we also know that the

875
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:24,160
young people who are vaping today would

876
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,750
not have considered smoking a cigarette

877
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:29,240
they would not have been at high risk

878
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:32,119
for tobacco use and now they are because

879
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,370
of their vaping behavior we also know

880
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:37,039
that a cigarette rates are continuing to

881
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:38,989
grow and use of combustible cigarettes

882
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,659
is decreasing or staying the same in

883
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,849
some populations it's also important to

884
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,259
know as dr. Tong had said that the the

885
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:47,509
products that young people are using

886
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:49,940
today have significantly higher levels

887
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:52,640
of nicotine than the products of the

888
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:55,100
past what's hard about these products we

889
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,710
don't know what young people are using

890
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:59,539
so unlike a cigarette that you would buy

891
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,579
you would smoke it and then it would be

892
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:03,619
extinguished and would be done these

893
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:05,990
products are used and students are

894
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:07,579
sharing them when we talk to teens about

895
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,619
their use and we ask them if they own

896
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:11,628
the products they say no what happens is

897
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:14,240
they leave class their friend does a

898
00:34:11,628 --> 00:34:17,000
puff puff and then passes the product to

899
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:19,519
them and then they puff puff and pass it

900
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,378
back and so they are sharing devices and

901
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:22,668
sharing different solutions and often

902
00:34:21,378 --> 00:34:24,559
times they have no idea what they're

903
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:27,108
actually vaping what's also interesting

904
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,989
is in 1998 after the master settlement

905
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:31,549
agreement was signed we saw a change in

906
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:34,039
tobacco use behavior among young people

907
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:36,139
where young people would experiment with

908
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:37,550
tobacco before the age of 18 and if they

909
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:39,320
became addicted they would do so in

910
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:42,050
their young adult years and that has

911
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,280
shifted in my time in tobacco control

912
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,869
this is the first time that we have

913
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,700
young adults or youth that are actually

914
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:49,159
self identifying as being addicted to

915
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:51,108
tobacco and seeking help in quitting and

916
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,329
we're trying desperately to figure out

917
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:55,730
how to get them that help oftentimes

918
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:57,289
they may not be ready to quit but at

919
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,760
least motivating them for those quit

920
00:34:57,289 --> 00:34:59,320
attempts is critically important because

921
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,620
they are

922
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,330
addicted levels of addiction are very

923
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:05,739
different as well and again we don't

924
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:07,659
fully understand how much nicotine

925
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:09,159
individuals are getting it's based on

926
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:11,170
the products are using the

927
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,089
bioavailability of those products the

928
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:16,030
frequency of use and that is still not a

929
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:17,579
perfect science to understand that so

930
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:20,440
California communities are responding

931
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:22,119
this data is already outdated as another

932
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,150
ordinance is passed earlier this week

933
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:27,029
but as of Friday there were 44 local

934
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:29,110
jurisdictions that had ordinances that

935
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,970
specifically related to flavored

936
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:32,980
products it's important to know that

937
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:35,709
much of this work was started early on

938
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:38,590
in response to FDA not including menthol

939
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:40,210
in the ban on cigarettes so much of this

940
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:42,490
work started to try to eliminate

941
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:45,699
mentholated products from the market and

942
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:48,189
has since expanded to include all vaping

943
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:49,809
products other products such as hookah

944
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,670
the majority of hookah bars in our state

945
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:53,110
are actually within a mile of a college

946
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,030
and university campus so it's not

947
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,230
surprising that colleges college

948
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,810
students have the highest rates of

949
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:00,369
hookah use in our state so when we look

950
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:02,259
at this more and more communities are

951
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:04,630
starting to amend their tobacco retail

952
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,370
license or adopt ordinances specifically

953
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,960
banning the sale of all flavored tobacco

954
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:10,750
products although some do have

955
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,369
exemptions we do have now it's four

956
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,780
ordinances but previously three

957
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:17,019
ordinances that ban the sale of

958
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:19,150
electronic smoking devices San Francisco

959
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:21,460
and Richmond have limitations on theirs

960
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,289
if FDA were to approve these products

961
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,690
Livermore's ban as a complete man with

962
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:27,519
no end date and then of course Beverly

963
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:29,559
Hills passed an ordinance that bans the

964
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,780
sale of all tobacco products in their

965
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:33,759
community with the exception of three

966
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,610
cigar bars that were left as an

967
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,720
exemption to allow use and sale within

968
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:43,809
those bars so in summary we do have an

969
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,789
epidemic we know that we have a history

970
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:48,159
of working with an industry that has

971
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:50,409
utilized tactics to try to dissuade the

972
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:53,079
conversation on Public Health the new

973
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:54,369
cigarette companies have employed many

974
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:57,489
of these same strategies and they're

975
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:59,199
under federal and Gatien into federal

976
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:02,079
litigation for that right now

977
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,969
there are numerous health concerns with

978
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,829
all of these products as dr. Tong had

979
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:07,599
mentioned the high potency of these new

980
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:09,639
pod based products both with nicotine

981
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,009
but also THC is very

982
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,838
worming we see some of the products we

983
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:16,059
had our team's been doing focus groups

984
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:17,768
for years and annually we ask them about

985
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:19,900
the products that they see what products

986
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:21,909
they use the pens the second-generation

987
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:24,338
pens that were previously used for

988
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:26,618
vaping nicotine solutions are now Prima

989
00:37:24,338 --> 00:37:28,750
primarily used by young people as wax

990
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:31,329
pens and they know exactly where to get

991
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,768
the cartridges and how to get them we

992
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:35,740
know that youth and young adult vaping

993
00:37:32,768 --> 00:37:37,149
has continued to increase and as new

994
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:40,118
data from the federal government shows

995
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:41,470
it is continuing and we know that the

996
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:43,240
burden of this problem is currently

997
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:44,828
existing under K through 12 schools in

998
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:46,389
our colleges and universities where

999
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:48,970
young people are using these products

1000
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:51,639
and the health systems are also trying

1001
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:53,980
to identify how do we help these people

1002
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:55,719
quit using them but there is a response

1003
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,510
from our local communities in California

1004
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:59,828
to respond and there are a number of

1005
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,539
individuals throughout the state that

1006
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:03,068
are working to try to reduce these rates

1007
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:10,269
and the support it's a backhoe free

1008
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:12,940
California thank you thank you very much

1009
00:38:10,268 --> 00:38:15,098
for your presentation it's both very

1010
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,159
informative and pretty alarming quite

1011
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:20,700
frankly I'd like to open this up to the

1012
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:23,699
pen to the members for questions

1013
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:23,699
questions

1014
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:37,690
mr. gray yeah thank you for your

1015
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:40,489
presentation I'm curious about the

1016
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:44,599
attention you went over the local

1017
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:46,459
ordinances at the city and county level

1018
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:48,940
throughout California I noticed every

1019
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:52,608
one of them deals with flavored tobacco

1020
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:55,519
any Secours right yet during your

1021
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:57,889
presentation unless I read that wrong it

1022
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,469
occurred to me that the highest use

1023
00:38:57,889 --> 00:39:03,589
seems to be marijuana products and we're

1024
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:06,230
vaping amongst teenagers which seems

1025
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:08,059
consistent since the outbreak of this

1026
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:12,170
public health crisis at least with the

1027
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:13,699
illnesses and the reported deaths I've

1028
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:16,190
had numerous conversations with school

1029
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:18,348
officials in my district every one of

1030
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,550
them has suggested that the great

1031
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:21,170
majority of products that they

1032
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:25,070
confiscate from young people at the high

1033
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:27,800
schools have marijuana in them and it's

1034
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:29,480
curious that the public policy response

1035
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,369
starting with the president all the way

1036
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,980
down to the local level is wrong your

1037
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:38,358
presentation is exclusively focused on

1038
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:39,740
e6 when that's not apparently the number

1039
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:41,329
one driver certainly a significant

1040
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:46,368
contributor which also was not in your

1041
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:49,489
presentation why do you think that is so

1042
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:52,190
in California we have our tobacco tax

1043
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:53,989
dollars are used to fund a comprehensive

1044
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:56,179
tobacco control program to address

1045
00:39:53,989 --> 00:39:58,879
tobacco control ordinances a similar

1046
00:39:56,179 --> 00:40:00,889
program for marijuana does not exist in

1047
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,150
the state so you think if a program did

1048
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:07,219
exist that might drive more of these

1049
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:09,289
local ordinances and efforts maybe calls

1050
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:12,139
for the banning of flavored marijuana

1051
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:14,210
for example I can't comment on that

1052
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:15,559
specifically but I can note that

1053
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:17,449
California does have one of the most

1054
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:19,670
successful tobacco control programs in

1055
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:22,909
the world and it's been extraordinarily

1056
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:24,619
successful in reducing tobacco use in

1057
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:27,920
our state as well as changing norms

1058
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:30,829
around tobacco use in the state here say

1059
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,838
it seems concerning I ran into several

1060
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:37,009
people vaping in my district over the

1061
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:38,929
past 30 days and took the time to cut

1062
00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:40,369
shot with them about what they were

1063
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:42,920
doing and what product they were using

1064
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:44,778
and one of things I found kind of

1065
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,519
shocking and and maybe something we

1066
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:48,409
could come to expect given the the

1067
00:40:46,518 --> 00:40:49,698
publicity and the press reporting and

1068
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:51,318
some of the information out there is

1069
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:55,099
that they were all under the impression

1070
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:58,308
that marijuana vaping was safe and the

1071
00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:59,959
tobacco vaping could kill you I assume

1072
00:40:58,309 --> 00:41:02,660
they got that impression from the news

1073
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:04,308
reports and some of the information put

1074
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:06,528
out there by advocacy groups and others

1075
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:08,359
kind of exclusively focused on tobacco

1076
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:09,650
but it seems like a danger when clear

1077
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:13,028
that we don't quite know what's causing

1078
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:15,829
it and and the public health warnings to

1079
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:18,679
not VAE period until we have a better

1080
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:20,028
idea or perhaps you know perhaps we

1081
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:22,039
don't get a better idea people shouldn't

1082
00:41:20,028 --> 00:41:26,358
be vaping at all and it's absolutely an

1083
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:27,799
unsafe or critically unsafe product but

1084
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,688
it strikes me that that's a dangerous

1085
00:41:27,798 --> 00:41:33,228
public health outcome when you have

1086
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:37,489
young people not informed about the real

1087
00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:40,338
dangers would you agree correct yes and

1088
00:41:37,489 --> 00:41:41,659
and again I'm I'm not in charge of

1089
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:44,058
funding decisions in the state of

1090
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:45,649
California but do you want to note we

1091
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:48,319
have an incredible tobacco control

1092
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:51,019
program who has obviously when we talk

1093
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:53,239
to young people I want to note that even

1094
00:41:51,018 --> 00:41:55,278
though we have seen increases in vaping

1095
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:57,769
among young people in California it's

1096
00:41:55,278 --> 00:41:59,599
lower than the national level so the

1097
00:41:57,768 --> 00:42:02,028
work that's being done to address

1098
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,119
tobacco control in this state is done

1099
00:42:02,028 --> 00:42:07,699
well and we are our making good

1100
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,679
successes but I can't speak to the

1101
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:16,099
marijuana prevention and public health

1102
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:16,699
aspect of that mr. Cooper yes for this

1103
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:18,048
McAdory

1104
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:21,079
hopefully I pronounced your name right

1105
00:42:18,048 --> 00:42:22,818
um it's your nonprofit right so you guys

1106
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:26,239
get money and really the big issue is I

1107
00:42:22,818 --> 00:42:27,858
agree with what mr. gray said over two

1108
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:31,519
billion dollars in tobacco tax revenue

1109
00:42:27,858 --> 00:42:34,818
is bought in by the state and yet less

1110
00:42:31,518 --> 00:42:36,288
than 3% is used for enforcement so while

1111
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,969
you pat yourself on the back for what

1112
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:39,650
you guys are done it's a different model

1113
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:41,838
now things have changed with the vaping

1114
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:43,329
so a lot of that money not in reading

1115
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,489
the information here

1116
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:46,440
some paperwork where most of that money

1117
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:49,419
that goes to the cities and counties

1118
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,490
goes for education or training but not

1119
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,680
for enforcement and that's really the

1120
00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:54,909
big issue with that and this legislature

1121
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,429
what do you want to do to deal with this

1122
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:59,079
issue because the black-market they're

1123
00:42:57,429 --> 00:43:01,839
in there to make money and make profits

1124
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:03,789
off of their people and that's we'll

1125
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,680
talk about later on but we've got to

1126
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:08,199
change that model with this we know

1127
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:12,009
something we're saying this but yet 3%

1128
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:15,399
is insufficient I know the AG allowed

1129
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:18,010
allocated 38 million this year for CD pH

1130
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,230
and DLJ but once again you know as far

1131
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:23,290
as its operation shoulder tap operations

1132
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:25,210
that law enforcement does that's not

1133
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:27,429
getting done that much so there are a

1134
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:28,809
whole host of issues with this but I put

1135
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:29,919
the blame on the state for a lot of

1136
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:32,980
these issues that have come up for a

1137
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,760
long time for a myriad of issues but but

1138
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,880
how do you

1139
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,720
I guess rectify that do you think more

1140
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,980
money should be given towards

1141
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:40,929
enforcement you're saying the rates are

1142
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,420
low but now obviously it's in keeping

1143
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:45,250
with vaping so it might be in on the

1144
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,559
enforcement in Morse to be allocated

1145
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:49,210
because obviously this education part is

1146
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:51,340
working like so much and the trainings

1147
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:54,780
are working so much because you can go

1148
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:56,890
to a pot shop without pot shop but a

1149
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,320
head shop whatever you want to call it

1150
00:43:56,889 --> 00:44:00,369
but the black market is out there so

1151
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,410
these kids can go anywhere in the black

1152
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:05,049
market and get it they're gonna sell so

1153
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:08,319
do you favor our support more funding

1154
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:10,360
for the enforcement end so I can't speak

1155
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,370
to that and I can't take a position on

1156
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,809
it but I can't say that I know the

1157
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:15,250
Department of Justice is here and that

1158
00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:16,630
they'll share the work that they've been

1159
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:19,210
doing with the grants that they've been

1160
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:21,099
given out the good thing that's

1161
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:22,809
happening with the funding from Prop 56

1162
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:24,190
with the combination of funding for

1163
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:25,599
Department of Justice Department of

1164
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,849
Education Department of Public Health

1165
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,009
there's a lot of new partnerships to try

1166
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:31,329
to bring allies and enforcement from the

1167
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,320
schools and then also from the

1168
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:34,029
Department of Public Health and

1169
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,740
community together to identify how to

1170
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:37,300
come about that but I'm not an expert on

1171
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:39,129
the enforcement side nor can I speak to

1172
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,660
that what the end of the day the

1173
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:43,000
enforcement still happens at a local

1174
00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:45,279
level loved ulj I've worked them for a

1175
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,179
long time dlj passes the money's host

1176
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,040
your local sheriffs and police

1177
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:50,288
departments that do all these operations

1178
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:51,998
so I guess

1179
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:53,380
the footing is inadequate and hasn't

1180
00:44:51,998 --> 00:44:56,078
been for quite some time thank you I

1181
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:58,150
just add also it depends on the social

1182
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,189
norm of the whole society so we know

1183
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,838
that kids are not always just going to

1184
00:45:00,188 --> 00:45:03,668
the stores to buy it they're getting it

1185
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:05,858
maybe from their parents for at least

1186
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:08,498
some of the confiscated products have

1187
00:45:05,858 --> 00:45:10,688
been even amongst friends or family so

1188
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:14,588
we have to address the whole society and

1189
00:45:10,688 --> 00:45:16,808
not just target and punish people but

1190
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:19,509
think about the whole of society and

1191
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:22,269
also the health the public health good

1192
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:23,769
that we're trying to do well my backrest

1193
00:45:22,268 --> 00:45:25,538
been thirty years in law enforcement and

1194
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:28,208
there are thousands of shops in LA that

1195
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:29,890
are black market shops so it's really

1196
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:32,228
easy for a young person to go to black

1197
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:33,489
market shop and buy it like these

1198
00:45:32,228 --> 00:45:35,918
cartridges are produced in China but

1199
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:38,769
they're filled up here in California be

1200
00:45:35,918 --> 00:45:41,798
a cannabis or the nicotine so it happens

1201
00:45:38,768 --> 00:45:43,478
here in the good old USA so like I said

1202
00:45:41,798 --> 00:45:45,130
at issue is you can't just bring your

1203
00:45:43,478 --> 00:45:46,058
head in the ground to those illicit

1204
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:48,660
shops that are out there in the

1205
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:48,660
thousands

1206
00:45:52,409 --> 00:45:56,730
yes mr. McCarney ah Thank You mr.

1207
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:58,798
Sheriff

1208
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,969
you know this is so overwhelming I don't

1209
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:02,670
even know where to start there's so many

1210
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:05,159
pieces and and I appreciate well first

1211
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:06,869
of all thank you to the three chairs for

1212
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:08,489
bringing this together when came up I

1213
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:11,160
think it was late August early September

1214
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:13,768
before we saw a lot of this movement so

1215
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:15,868
certainly it's very timely and the

1216
00:46:13,768 --> 00:46:18,508
issues and frankly the questions that

1217
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:22,200
are arising come by the by the day if

1218
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:23,818
not by the hour I do think that it's the

1219
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:25,588
overarching topic is important as you

1220
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:27,599
said dr. what I think that's kind of how

1221
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:31,588
I said it be you articulated very wisely

1222
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:33,660
that this the Youth epidemic and we see

1223
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:35,578
the romanticism with the flavours which

1224
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:37,679
I'll get to in a second for this other

1225
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:40,289
question that that mr. gray talked about

1226
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:42,509
is this whole issue of the all the

1227
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:45,028
vaping is is it safe in the first place

1228
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:47,429
should we be permitting it so there's I

1229
00:46:45,028 --> 00:46:49,259
know that there's legal elements of it

1230
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:51,298
and some say it's the illegal pieces but

1231
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:53,608
how do you differentiate and I think

1232
00:46:51,298 --> 00:46:57,000
that that is a real question we have to

1233
00:46:53,608 --> 00:47:01,170
to offer ask ourselves so I want to

1234
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,659
start with first as far as the the

1235
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:05,880
product as a whole we saw that your

1236
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:08,399
great PowerPoint and the in the decline

1237
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,608
in smoking rates across our country here

1238
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,400
in California and one of the the pushes

1239
00:47:11,608 --> 00:47:17,130
of the industry this is an alternative

1240
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,230
and and they they have said that it's a

1241
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:22,130
safe alternative and the FDA of course

1242
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:24,449
came at them and said you can't say that

1243
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:27,509
now am i understanding I just saw this

1244
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:28,919
advertisement came up on someone's email

1245
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:31,679
yesterday and they said to me and it

1246
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,119
says it's a satisfying alternative so I

1247
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,038
guess they're changing their language

1248
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,519
it's not a safe alternative but it's a

1249
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:40,980
satisfying I guess that's not necessary

1250
00:47:37,518 --> 00:47:43,679
illegal so as far as the alternative

1251
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:45,690
what does the public health world say

1252
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:46,558
about that as far as alternate or -

1253
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:49,349
standard

1254
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,690
tobacco smoking use alright so I think

1255
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:53,369
that's by underscoring what the CDC has

1256
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:55,889
emphasized there's no safe tobacco

1257
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:58,140
product and we're learning about the

1258
00:47:55,889 --> 00:48:02,009
wide range of health effects of THC as

1259
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:04,529
well what I tell my patients is your

1260
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:07,320
blends are meant to breathe clean air

1261
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:10,680
and so my goal as a provider will be to

1262
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:12,750
help you quit for good so it as an

1263
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:15,869
alternative I would probably say let's

1264
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,829
try to get you to zero and have clean

1265
00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:20,969
lungs

1266
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:22,799
yes it's somewhat similar two years ago

1267
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:25,349
they came out with filters and they said

1268
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,840
to filtered cigarettes are safer and

1269
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:30,179
potentially marginally safer but but are

1270
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:34,650
they safe so a minder saying when they

1271
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:37,049
first came out with the patches and the

1272
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,550
gum there were there were prescriptions

1273
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:40,789
to get them you couldn't buy them over

1274
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:43,080
the counter mm-hmm has I never been

1275
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:46,050
talked about as having if there if there

1276
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:48,809
is an alternative to having it utilized

1277
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:51,990
by people and medicine like like you

1278
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:53,429
right so pharmacy as opposed to these

1279
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:55,799
these little shops that we see around

1280
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:58,079
town right so how to quit

1281
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,150
especially when nicotine is so addictive

1282
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,610
these medications those five nicotine

1283
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:04,800
replacement medications are meant to

1284
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:06,210
help people with withdrawal symptoms as

1285
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,720
which are especially worse in the first

1286
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:11,639
couple weeks anxiety irritability you

1287
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:13,349
know I've seen people want to leave the

1288
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:16,079
hospital against medical advice because

1289
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:17,819
they can't go out for a cigarette but it

1290
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,650
can really lead to a lot of agitation so

1291
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:24,059
those medications are meant over two to

1292
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:26,309
three months to help you help your brain

1293
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:28,409
unlearn the nicotine addiction and to

1294
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:31,619
learn new behaviors to replace the

1295
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:33,089
product that you are using so you know

1296
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:34,710
I've heard in the news media like well

1297
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:36,360
maybe people trying to quit vaping

1298
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:38,309
should go back to cigarettes no we have

1299
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,930
medications that are time tested but

1300
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:42,480
what we're facing here is a new high

1301
00:49:39,929 --> 00:49:44,009
potency nicotine that even as a provider

1302
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,409
I don't even know quite how to dose

1303
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:48,480
people I can only just hope to try to

1304
00:49:46,409 --> 00:49:51,929
titrate up to what their needs are until

1305
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,059
their own symptoms are abated okay and

1306
00:49:51,929 --> 00:49:56,449
then to the youth piece I know you

1307
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:59,309
talked about this Kimberly so it's

1308
00:49:56,449 --> 00:50:00,480
advertising is a big bit and literally

1309
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:02,099
last night I was driving through my

1310
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,920
district and we see these shops all over

1311
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:06,989
there and we know that they there's the

1312
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:10,769
youth element with the flavor and we've

1313
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:12,389
seen reports that LGBT community is is

1314
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:14,880
is have hired numbers for this literally

1315
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:17,489
I saw a shop with the with the pride

1316
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,820
colors I'm sure you can see it it's a

1317
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:24,229
blueberry vape shop blueberry vape and

1318
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:26,910
smoke on what Avenue and just

1319
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:29,990
unbelievable that's exactly what we're

1320
00:50:26,909 --> 00:50:33,690
talking about the population and it's

1321
00:50:29,989 --> 00:50:36,089
targeting the community come to come

1322
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:39,059
right in knowing that there's this

1323
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:41,010
romanticism I know that I have eleven

1324
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:42,630
year old girls and they were selling

1325
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:45,960
girl-scout cookies right over here at

1326
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:48,059
Safeway and one of my daughters saw

1327
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:51,030
somebody coming out vaping the cinnamon

1328
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:52,799
just like Daddy that that it smells

1329
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:58,140
really good it smells like it tastes

1330
00:50:52,800 --> 00:51:00,990
really good too 11 year old yeah so you

1331
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:03,750
know these kids have everything around

1332
00:51:00,989 --> 00:51:07,500
them if they see it's cool that they

1333
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:09,659
have the advertising and so this is a

1334
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:12,570
crazy crazy epidemic and it's coming

1335
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:14,759
from all different angles and you know

1336
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:18,059
it's part of its up coming up on us to

1337
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:20,970
to really act and I know there's no one

1338
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:23,369
solution I get that there's not one bill

1339
00:51:20,969 --> 00:51:25,799
one thing I know talking about last

1340
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:28,380
year's a package of things on the menu

1341
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:30,390
to do to tackle this and I think that

1342
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,430
we're we're doing this today the

1343
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:34,259
conversation we're hopefully going to be

1344
00:51:32,429 --> 00:51:36,419
pushing some policy in the near future

1345
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:40,830
cities are stepping up and doing it too

1346
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:43,769
but I don't think that one flavor ban or

1347
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:46,440
policy is going to end you know even if

1348
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:49,710
you go after the shops and mr. gray and

1349
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:52,019
I had some amazing presentations this

1350
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:54,840
past year talking about the shops that

1351
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:58,170
are getting the stings it's not the

1352
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:00,358
grocery stores it's the little montage

1353
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:03,150
shops and they're the ones are having

1354
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:04,769
the huge huge numbers and so having more

1355
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:07,380
enforcement there like mr. Cooper say I

1356
00:52:04,769 --> 00:52:09,480
think is part of the solution but even

1357
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:12,630
if we shut down that you know kids are

1358
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:15,780
smart they figure out mom's password to

1359
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:18,340
Amazon and buy stuff online and so it's

1360
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:21,760
going to take a multitude of ways

1361
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:25,030
to go after this so the last topic I

1362
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,460
wanted to discuss his I understand that

1363
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:33,010
it's it's it's a nuanced issue with the

1364
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:36,369
with the non tobacco vaping and first of

1365
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:39,190
all I even know how many if there is is

1366
00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:43,990
it prevalent for the cannabis vaping and

1367
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:48,490
flavors do we know that so I get data on

1368
00:52:43,989 --> 00:52:50,618
the vaping specifically of THC and

1369
00:52:48,489 --> 00:52:54,879
flavor THC and I do not believe that

1370
00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:55,900
that exists okay so as mr. Gray's

1371
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,230
suggestion if we did have

1372
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:01,510
across-the-board no flavor for tobacco

1373
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:04,000
and cannabis we don't really know how

1374
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:08,230
much that would impact the cannabis

1375
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:11,409
vaping products potentially it's it

1376
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:14,170
correct my my expertise is not in THC

1377
00:53:11,409 --> 00:53:16,149
sites so I'm not aware of what percent

1378
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:17,980
of vaping devices are sold in flavors

1379
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:21,700
and what percent of young people are

1380
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:24,219
vaping flavored wax pens okay or THC

1381
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:25,839
devices and then the last issue and this

1382
00:53:24,219 --> 00:53:27,309
the question which I think is the

1383
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:30,460
question we're asking about the

1384
00:53:27,309 --> 00:53:34,329
illnesses and it's it's mainly from the

1385
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:37,179
THC products and the industry is saying

1386
00:53:34,329 --> 00:53:39,730
hey that's not our product that's the

1387
00:53:37,179 --> 00:53:41,889
illegal black market product that's

1388
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:45,010
coming over and they're not having the

1389
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:46,449
same metals in there that we haven't

1390
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:50,590
tested and so forth I don't know the

1391
00:53:46,449 --> 00:53:53,799
sciences I may be messing that up but I

1392
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:56,140
would assume that people who are who use

1393
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,090
this product they use it all right they

1394
00:53:56,139 --> 00:53:59,440
don't they're not pure they don't just

1395
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:03,640
do one or the other so it's hard to tell

1396
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:08,590
which one was the culprit and so is

1397
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:11,739
there a way to to have a safe nuanced

1398
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:15,850
way for the cannabis product and go

1399
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:18,368
after the the devices that are really

1400
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:20,230
causing harm can we understand that you

1401
00:54:18,369 --> 00:54:22,450
know what I was getting at yes but I

1402
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:25,690
think that's why the CDC has come out

1403
00:54:22,449 --> 00:54:27,639
saying out of all the 500 and so things

1404
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:29,858
they could get from the cases that were

1405
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:31,690
sick and they couldn't find one

1406
00:54:29,858 --> 00:54:34,179
substance or one product

1407
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:35,650
to call it upon that's why they're still

1408
00:54:34,179 --> 00:54:37,868
making that very strong statement

1409
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:40,000
everyone please just stop thinking until

1410
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:42,280
we try to figure this out I don't think

1411
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,019
we really know and I and so far there's

1412
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:47,500
no suggestion that say there is a safe

1413
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:50,019
device or way of vaping or what chemical

1414
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:52,719
so the medical community is with the CDC

1415
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:54,250
and saying with all the questions and

1416
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:56,618
not enough answers we should just do a

1417
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:58,929
time-out on all the stuff I think that

1418
00:54:56,619 --> 00:55:02,710
would be the safest thing for Public

1419
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:04,899
Health mm-hmm and and is there ongoing

1420
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:09,010
research that enables you to see if they

1421
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:11,139
their devices that are legally sold do

1422
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:15,250
have some safety requirements in them

1423
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:16,690
that so this is where the FDA regulation

1424
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:18,338
is supposed to come into play where the

1425
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:21,250
manufacturers are supposed to submit

1426
00:55:18,338 --> 00:55:23,769
information about their products and the

1427
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:27,099
effect on health so that's why that

1428
00:55:23,769 --> 00:55:28,900
deadline that moratorium is now being up

1429
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:31,480
to next year okay thank you and I know

1430
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:33,548
our later panel has our Department of

1431
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,079
Public Health so that potentially these

1432
00:55:33,548 --> 00:55:36,130
issues will be addressed there as well

1433
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:39,160
thank you

1434
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:40,480
Thank You mr. chair thank you um so we

1435
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:43,449
have miss lon

1436
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,250
mr. Lowe and then mr. Cooper again great

1437
00:55:43,449 --> 00:55:48,098
thank you I appreciate the conversation

1438
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:50,349
I think this for me I first started

1439
00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:52,088
thinking about this in 2011-12 when I

1440
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:54,880
was on a school board and we did not

1441
00:55:52,088 --> 00:55:56,710
know if our tobacco policy for Student

1442
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,510
Conduct actually covered vaping it was

1443
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:01,179
very confusing then we didn't know if

1444
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:02,950
the law allowed for that and I think

1445
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:05,710
since then the school districts have

1446
00:56:02,949 --> 00:56:07,629
evolved into thinking and I know some of

1447
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:10,230
my colleagues have touched upon issues

1448
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:13,180
of enforcement or impact health impact

1449
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:15,099
but one of the things that I heard in

1450
00:56:13,179 --> 00:56:17,889
this presentation repeated was the lack

1451
00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:19,960
of understanding and education which I

1452
00:56:17,889 --> 00:56:22,538
find to be one of the harder things to

1453
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,250
do to educate the public and so I just

1454
00:56:22,539 --> 00:56:26,140
wondered if you could speak to what

1455
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:29,679
you're seeing in terms of best practice

1456
00:56:26,139 --> 00:56:31,588
as educating the youth or public about

1457
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:33,940
this certainly there have been articles

1458
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:38,940
clearly the articles have not had an

1459
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:41,059
impact on you know mass number of minors

1460
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:42,889
decreasing their use at least not

1461
00:56:41,059 --> 00:56:45,079
with the data that you presented so what

1462
00:56:42,889 --> 00:56:47,779
are the best practices what what is

1463
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:51,369
California doing well to try to educate

1464
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:53,450
minors and adults about the impact

1465
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:55,909
that's a great question

1466
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:57,409
so again to refer back to the tobacco

1467
00:56:55,909 --> 00:56:59,210
control program we have here in

1468
00:56:57,409 --> 00:57:02,000
California so the the focus of that

1469
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:04,550
program is to denormalize the use of

1470
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,559
tobacco control and part of that is by

1471
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:10,430
engaging communities to change the norms

1472
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:12,739
of the access to tobacco the exposure to

1473
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:15,139
tobacco the advertising and marketing to

1474
00:57:12,739 --> 00:57:17,149
various tobacco products and retail

1475
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:18,829
environments also there's a lot of work

1476
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:21,380
happening at the local level to change

1477
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:23,299
the number the density of retailers and

1478
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:25,760
communities the location of those

1479
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:28,010
retailers and moving them away from

1480
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,650
schools so that's one part of it the

1481
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:33,770
second side is to do the media campaign

1482
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:36,110
and to try to engage parents and adults

1483
00:57:33,769 --> 00:57:38,000
and young adults around not just the

1484
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:41,570
dangers of the products but what's

1485
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,550
happening within communities and tobacco

1486
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:45,890
industry tactics and so that work is

1487
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:47,900
continuing so that's just the side that

1488
00:57:45,889 --> 00:57:49,519
the Department of Public Health has the

1489
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,079
Department of Education who is also

1490
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:53,269
partner in this work then does the

1491
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:54,559
school work specifically and so they're

1492
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:56,869
funding through their tobacco use

1493
00:57:54,559 --> 00:58:00,529
prevention education program then goes

1494
00:57:56,869 --> 00:58:02,809
to try to train teachers and educate

1495
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:05,690
parents and administrators on the

1496
00:58:02,809 --> 00:58:07,789
problem of these products what hadas off

1497
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:11,690
guard was how quickly these products

1498
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:13,909
grew and as Assemblymember gray noted

1499
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:15,710
that oftentimes when we go into schools

1500
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:18,829
and we ask what product seeing people

1501
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:21,800
are using we I I remember I was actually

1502
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:23,210
in Madera County and talked to some law

1503
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,920
enforcement who were working with high

1504
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:26,449
school students and learned that all of

1505
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,700
the products they confiscated were wax

1506
00:58:26,449 --> 00:58:30,319
pens and I was surprised by that but

1507
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:32,539
when we talked to students we find out

1508
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:34,280
that they are constantly trying to be

1509
00:58:32,539 --> 00:58:37,670
ahead of the game so when we focus just

1510
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:39,530
on jool parents know what joules are so

1511
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:43,579
they're looking for joules and so then

1512
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:45,800
kids go to sauron or they go to novo or

1513
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:47,000
any of the other new products and so

1514
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,710
it's trying to get the bigger picture

1515
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,269
and not just focus on a product but

1516
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:52,670
trying to create healthier communities

1517
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:54,528
by removing the products and then by

1518
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:57,798
having media campaigns to make people

1519
00:58:54,528 --> 00:58:59,268
aware of them and as was also noted a

1520
00:58:57,798 --> 00:59:01,309
lot of the comprehensive policies that

1521
00:58:59,268 --> 00:59:02,868
local jurisdictions are creating not so

1522
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:05,960
much on the sales but on the use of

1523
00:59:02,869 --> 00:59:07,490
these products I know that the majority

1524
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:10,400
of our colleges and universities in the

1525
00:59:07,489 --> 00:59:13,068
states have comprehensive policies that

1526
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,289
cover the inhalation or use of any

1527
00:59:13,068 --> 00:59:17,358
combustible or vaporized product on

1528
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:19,160
their campus and the idea is that if we

1529
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:20,778
can remove the use from being visible

1530
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:23,389
that will change the norm and then that

1531
00:59:20,778 --> 00:59:25,518
will then change people's use because

1532
00:59:23,389 --> 00:59:27,528
it's not normalized to use it so it's a

1533
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:29,449
really comprehensive program that

1534
00:59:27,528 --> 00:59:31,309
communities are working on community

1535
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:32,750
coalition's across the state the

1536
00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:34,339
Department of Public Health has a really

1537
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:36,079
robust and very successful media

1538
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:37,670
campaign and then the Department of

1539
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,349
Education is working within the schools

1540
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:41,240
to try to address it from all approaches

1541
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:43,730
and really trying to engage all

1542
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:46,129
community members including parents to

1543
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:48,469
make them aware of these and then really

1544
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:50,660
helping to equip them and to equip

1545
00:59:48,469 --> 00:59:53,000
trusted adults to be able to ask the

1546
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:54,588
question about use to advise and

1547
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
encourage quit attempts and then to

1548
00:59:54,588 --> 00:59:58,639
refer them to services that can help

1549
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,929
them quit thank you clearly sounds that

1550
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:03,018
there's no doubt that it's comprehensive

1551
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:06,230
I think my concern is that despite how

1552
01:00:03,018 --> 01:00:08,899
comprehensive it is the problem is

1553
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:11,240
outpacing the potential solution and so

1554
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:13,430
I'm just wondering if our definition or

1555
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:15,409
understanding of comprehensive is going

1556
01:00:13,429 --> 01:00:18,828
to have to adapt to a problem that's

1557
01:00:15,409 --> 01:00:20,629
evolved I'm at a very fast and deep way

1558
01:00:18,829 --> 01:00:25,099
and I think I'm trying to grapple with

1559
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:27,950
that so I appreciate the feedback may I

1560
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:31,160
add that the doctors need to be educated

1561
01:00:27,949 --> 01:00:32,868
as well we we don't know how to ask and

1562
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:34,608
treat these things and they what the

1563
01:00:32,869 --> 01:00:36,950
kids are doing we don't even know that

1564
01:00:34,608 --> 01:00:38,480
they're the same parents who are the

1565
01:00:36,949 --> 01:00:40,489
providers who are trying to keep up or

1566
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:44,240
may not know that you know this problem

1567
01:00:40,489 --> 01:00:46,229
is out there that's true

1568
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:47,909
thank you very much and thank you right

1569
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:50,068
doctor Tong and Kimberly for your

1570
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:51,769
presentation I will admit to that your

1571
01:00:50,068 --> 01:00:55,048
presentation scared the crap out of me

1572
01:00:51,769 --> 01:00:56,579
because we have done such hard work in

1573
01:00:55,048 --> 01:00:58,710
trying to address this public health

1574
01:00:56,579 --> 01:01:00,839
crisis now seems to be coming right back

1575
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:03,240
again and so the sense of urgency is

1576
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:04,500
very real but I wanted to call your

1577
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:06,868
attention to this slide that you

1578
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:09,000
provided to us with respect to one-third

1579
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:12,210
of tobacco shops and vape shops sold to

1580
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:17,099
minors in 2018 your graphic here about

1581
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:20,309
34 percent of usage comes from tobacco

1582
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:23,190
and vaping vape shops specifically so

1583
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:25,798
that of one-third going to that of

1584
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:27,690
minors we heard earlier about that of

1585
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:29,429
locals and school districts and the

1586
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:30,929
challenges of local municipalities

1587
01:01:29,429 --> 01:01:33,088
trying to tackle this issues of bans

1588
01:01:30,929 --> 01:01:34,919
outright and oftentimes at the state

1589
01:01:33,088 --> 01:01:36,808
level we battle on that of local control

1590
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,519
versus the state coming in but it's

1591
01:01:36,809 --> 01:01:41,309
clear to me that the locals are not

1592
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:43,019
necessarily in control and as I've had

1593
01:01:41,309 --> 01:01:44,490
an opportunity to meet when we're now

1594
01:01:43,019 --> 01:01:46,288
out of session with local school

1595
01:01:44,489 --> 01:01:48,328
district and board members this is the

1596
01:01:46,289 --> 01:01:49,680
number one issue that they are hearing

1597
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:51,480
and seeing about that they are not able

1598
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:53,788
to tackle this and they're asking

1599
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,349
specifically for additional help from

1600
01:01:53,789 --> 01:01:57,270
the state to try to tackle this do you

1601
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:59,190
have any guidance or insights with

1602
01:01:57,269 --> 01:02:01,409
respect to that of locals and the role

1603
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:02,849
of state versus local and again seeing

1604
01:02:01,409 --> 01:02:05,429
that the lack of enforcement

1605
01:02:02,849 --> 01:02:07,740
specifically going to selling to minors

1606
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:10,679
of one-third going to tobacco stores do

1607
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:13,108
you have any sense on the observations

1608
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:14,730
or mechanisms that you're hearing as you

1609
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:16,409
are engaged in talking to those most

1610
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:18,510
impacted I knew a number of

1611
01:02:16,409 --> 01:02:21,088
jurisdictions are adopting stronger

1612
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:23,278
tobacco retail licenses many don't have

1613
01:02:21,088 --> 01:02:25,650
retail licenses right now and are

1614
01:02:23,278 --> 01:02:28,380
looking at adopting them with stronger

1615
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:30,650
fees associated stronger penalties and

1616
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:33,298
then also the inclusion of flavor bans

1617
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:34,858
the the focus on the flavor ban is

1618
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:36,929
because we know that young people are

1619
01:02:34,858 --> 01:02:39,568
initiating tobacco use because the

1620
01:02:36,929 --> 01:02:41,669
products are flavored and they seem less

1621
01:02:39,568 --> 01:02:43,318
harmful as a result and so by

1622
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:44,970
eliminating those products it's

1623
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:49,528
eliminating products that are attracting

1624
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:51,709
youth to purchase them but as we have

1625
01:02:49,528 --> 01:02:54,650
sort of seen the trends are given your

1626
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:57,079
presentation there are that's a

1627
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:58,730
relatively small segment of local

1628
01:02:57,079 --> 01:03:02,690
municipalities that have actually taken

1629
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:06,469
action and yet the impacted populations

1630
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:08,809
since you've also shown the percentage

1631
01:03:06,469 --> 01:03:11,118
continues to rise but again I think

1632
01:03:08,809 --> 01:03:13,309
maybe you have any insights with respect

1633
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,960
to do you believe that local

1634
01:03:13,309 --> 01:03:17,780
jurisdictions are actually doing what

1635
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,309
they can and should be doing to sort of

1636
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:21,619
tackle this issues given the rates and

1637
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:24,170
then also given the statistics of that

1638
01:03:21,619 --> 01:03:26,240
of enforcement going to miners because

1639
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:28,099
again local seeds we hear all the time

1640
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:31,279
local control but they're clearly not in

1641
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:34,730
control if the miners are being sold

1642
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:36,109
these products I think that some

1643
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:38,449
jurisdictions in the state have a

1644
01:03:36,108 --> 01:03:40,400
stronger history of adopting strong

1645
01:03:38,449 --> 01:03:42,139
tobacco control ordinances and we see

1646
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,450
that with those jurisdictions having

1647
01:03:42,139 --> 01:03:45,889
policies in place now I know that

1648
01:03:44,449 --> 01:03:48,230
there's a lot of work being done

1649
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:49,909
throughout this state but I know that

1650
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:50,630
there are regions where it may not be

1651
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:53,058
happening

1652
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:54,769
sure did you off the top of your head

1653
01:03:53,059 --> 01:03:55,970
you just referenced a number of

1654
01:03:54,769 --> 01:03:58,369
jurisdictions that have comprehensive

1655
01:03:55,969 --> 01:04:00,348
policies that may be doing better with

1656
01:03:58,369 --> 01:04:01,670
respect to that of enforcement and some

1657
01:04:00,349 --> 01:04:03,829
of these policies are any jurisdictions

1658
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:06,470
I can't speak to the enforcement piece

1659
01:04:03,829 --> 01:04:09,829
but I know that we know specifically the

1660
01:04:06,469 --> 01:04:12,169
bay area has been the champion for

1661
01:04:09,829 --> 01:04:14,660
flavored ordinance we know that Los

1662
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:16,400
Angeles has recently the county has

1663
01:04:14,659 --> 01:04:18,379
recently had an ordinance the city is

1664
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,510
looking at an ordinance the city of

1665
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:22,579
Sacramento's which just went into effect

1666
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:25,630
so definitely more of the urban

1667
01:04:22,579 --> 01:04:28,099
communities to have ordinances that are

1668
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:33,039
already adopted or are closer to

1669
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:34,880
adoption thank you very much mr. Cooper

1670
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,170
follow-up to miss Mills question all

1671
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,119
those ordinances they have them in place

1672
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:39,798
but you walk around downtown outside

1673
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:42,470
people are still a vape in be in

1674
01:04:39,798 --> 01:04:43,400
Sacramento LA or San Francisco but I'll

1675
01:04:42,469 --> 01:04:46,459
go back to the doctor

1676
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:49,160
CDC's that take a break from vaping and

1677
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:50,949
that's just unrealistic I think when

1678
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:54,679
people are involved in addiction be it

1679
01:04:50,949 --> 01:04:57,409
tobacco alcohol or illicit drugs it is

1680
01:04:54,679 --> 01:04:59,269
just tough to kick no matter what FDA is

1681
01:04:57,409 --> 01:05:01,308
saying hey vaping is better than smoking

1682
01:04:59,269 --> 01:05:02,300
tobacco so we've got a whole group of

1683
01:05:01,309 --> 01:05:04,940
people

1684
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:07,580
out there and I think it's unrealistic

1685
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:09,440
to do that maybe 10 years from now or

1686
01:05:07,579 --> 01:05:11,150
whatever we find out we more information

1687
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,380
on this I don't know there's no timeline

1688
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:15,519
really and I'm sure it's not gonna

1689
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:19,070
happen anytime soon so being realistic

1690
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:22,460
they're not taking a break so I guess

1691
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:25,039
that's the doctor vaping if it's I guess

1692
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:28,579
it's just not from the black market it's

1693
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:30,769
still safer than smoking tobacco then so

1694
01:05:28,579 --> 01:05:34,329
I think this is where the FDA regulation

1695
01:05:30,769 --> 01:05:38,449
is of e-cigarettes is still not there

1696
01:05:34,329 --> 01:05:41,210
and this is for the manufacturers to

1697
01:05:38,449 --> 01:05:42,949
submit information about health so I

1698
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:45,019
don't think we can even make that

1699
01:05:42,949 --> 01:05:47,269
statement that it's a safe end it right

1700
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:50,599
now the CDs saying there's no safe

1701
01:05:47,269 --> 01:05:52,820
tobacco product and but we know that

1702
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:55,130
they're inhaling these chemicals with

1703
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:58,970
vaping can have immediate health effects

1704
01:05:55,130 --> 01:06:00,980
so as the Surgeon General has noted you

1705
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:03,469
know even for non users secondhand

1706
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:04,880
aerosol has harmful constituents so I

1707
01:06:03,469 --> 01:06:07,519
think what we're seeing right now is

1708
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:10,309
maybe what you're referring to is does

1709
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:13,340
maybe having less carcinogens in some of

1710
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:14,719
these products maybe does that mean less

1711
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:16,970
harm and I think that's why I'm trying

1712
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:19,159
to also show this is maybe what was

1713
01:06:16,969 --> 01:06:21,230
thought for low tar before but it takes

1714
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:23,868
years for the scientific evidence to

1715
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:25,369
keep coming out and every day there's a

1716
01:06:23,869 --> 01:06:27,320
lot of evidence about immediate

1717
01:06:25,369 --> 01:06:30,590
biological effects and it'll take a few

1718
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:32,000
years to get at the Dini ology data so I

1719
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:33,769
think that's where a lot of the public

1720
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,809
confusion is where they think these are

1721
01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:37,759
newer safer cleaner products they don't

1722
01:06:35,809 --> 01:06:39,920
make you smell it Mike but must be

1723
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:42,770
better but I think we are now finding

1724
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:44,720
out there is still a lot of learning to

1725
01:06:42,769 --> 01:06:46,849
do with the science and so far the

1726
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:48,579
science is showing this is not a safe

1727
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:52,190
product so for some of the previous

1728
01:06:48,579 --> 01:06:54,259
vaping pens from nicotine part that went

1729
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:57,760
through FDA they were approved to the

1730
01:06:54,260 --> 01:07:00,830
FDA and tested they never what did the

1731
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:04,250
manufacturers submit to the FDA right so

1732
01:07:00,829 --> 01:07:07,340
I think in 2016 the deeming rule by the

1733
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:08,329
FDA is that it has authority to regulate

1734
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:11,539
e-cigarettes

1735
01:07:08,329 --> 01:07:14,150
but right now whatever is on the label

1736
01:07:11,539 --> 01:07:15,550
it's not regulated that hasn't been

1737
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:17,320
implemented yet so that's why

1738
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:19,030
they've started trying to move up that

1739
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:22,210
moratorium to say start submitting

1740
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:24,610
what's actually in these things the FDA

1741
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:26,409
does fund what's called T cores these

1742
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:27,700
tobacco centers of regulatory science

1743
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:31,029
that have been producing some of this

1744
01:07:27,699 --> 01:07:33,669
scientific evidence and it needs to be

1745
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:37,210
compiled and they're also informing the

1746
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:40,059
FDA about these products as well so it's

1747
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:41,260
still early stages to say that these

1748
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:43,119
that we even know what's in these

1749
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:44,530
products and the effects on human health

1750
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:47,289
so the media has been all over this and

1751
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:50,440
they've submitted a lot of test samples

1752
01:07:47,289 --> 01:07:52,630
for testing and from what I've seen in

1753
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:54,820
the media all their test samples that

1754
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:58,329
came back we're from the illicit market

1755
01:07:54,820 --> 01:08:01,809
be it tobacco or cannabis and not

1756
01:07:58,329 --> 01:08:03,639
legitimate manufacturers so I think when

1757
01:08:01,809 --> 01:08:05,559
you look at this I mean a lot of it

1758
01:08:03,639 --> 01:08:06,429
comes from earlier you guys talked about

1759
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:08,920
the brick and motar

1760
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:12,609
it's like seventy four percent a lot of

1761
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:15,550
it comes from the illicit market so it

1762
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:17,619
seemed to me just as a layman that that

1763
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:19,510
is a big issue with it where a lot of

1764
01:08:17,619 --> 01:08:20,829
these products do come from no doubt

1765
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:22,989
that's something that needs to be

1766
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:25,600
regulated and you know as you were

1767
01:08:22,989 --> 01:08:27,389
mentioning you know we need Department

1768
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,400
of Justice to also help with this but

1769
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:32,440
you know I think it's very challenging

1770
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:34,869
because the the products that the CDC

1771
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:36,189
investigation has then it's not even all

1772
01:08:34,869 --> 01:08:37,989
of the cases that they've been able to

1773
01:08:36,189 --> 01:08:39,519
get the products and tests so what they

1774
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:41,588
don't know and that's what they conclude

1775
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,750
is right now there is no single product

1776
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:45,880
or substance but at the same time

1777
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:47,619
they're saying please ask some of these

1778
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,239
questions about where are people getting

1779
01:08:47,619 --> 01:08:51,159
it how are they using it what are they

1780
01:08:49,239 --> 01:08:52,809
filling it up with and they're asking

1781
01:08:51,159 --> 01:08:54,059
doctors to ask these questions to help

1782
01:08:52,810 --> 01:09:01,770
it out

1783
01:08:54,060 --> 01:09:01,770
we don't know thank you anyone else

1784
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:06,369
go ahead and local bastards

1785
01:09:07,659 --> 01:09:15,349
so my colleagues have inspired some

1786
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:17,150
additional questions for you one things

1787
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:18,680
you know the the the debate of the

1788
01:09:17,149 --> 01:09:21,469
discussion the dialogue in the state

1789
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:23,659
legislature in California this year was

1790
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:27,680
predominantly on one hand folks that

1791
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:32,199
wanted to focus on the moratorium or the

1792
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:36,530
banning of flavored Ystad products and

1793
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:39,609
the other less of effort we had was to

1794
01:09:36,529 --> 01:09:43,429
focus more on the oversight regulation

1795
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:45,949
taxation of e-cigs as we do into

1796
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:47,690
traditional tobacco I was involved as

1797
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:49,819
one of the authors on the oversight

1798
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:52,069
regulatory approach and the inspiration

1799
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:53,899
for that was frankly traditional tracker

1800
01:09:52,069 --> 01:09:56,449
right we've seen in traditional

1801
01:09:53,899 --> 01:10:01,599
education oversight regulation taxation

1802
01:09:56,449 --> 01:10:03,829
has been a successful recipe to reduce

1803
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:07,130
consumption with youth and the general

1804
01:10:03,829 --> 01:10:09,380
public right and sometimes we don't need

1805
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:11,569
to be smarter than ourselves up here but

1806
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:14,090
rather look at effective practices and

1807
01:10:11,569 --> 01:10:15,199
then replicate those and so you know at

1808
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:20,170
one point we had a bill before

1809
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:23,869
legislature that of the 15,000 reported

1810
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:26,210
tobacco flavors he said flavors that

1811
01:10:23,869 --> 01:10:28,069
were out there would have restricted the

1812
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:29,930
sale of 14 thousand nine hundred and

1813
01:10:28,069 --> 01:10:31,009
ninety seven of them consistent with

1814
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:33,110
traditional tobacco where you have

1815
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:35,989
menthol and traditional tobacco flavors

1816
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:40,099
available but not some of these flavors

1817
01:10:35,989 --> 01:10:42,409
that we discussed earlier and the

1818
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:44,870
committee that I serve on in regulates

1819
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:47,029
language NACO of alcohol as well and I

1820
01:10:44,869 --> 01:10:49,250
would point to prohibition in the early

1821
01:10:47,029 --> 01:10:51,859
part of the last century as an example

1822
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:53,479
of where more turns bands aren't

1823
01:10:51,859 --> 01:10:56,119
necessarily always effective in fact

1824
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:58,699
sometimes they serve to exasperate the

1825
01:10:56,119 --> 01:11:02,059
black market and now as we're faced with

1826
01:10:58,699 --> 01:11:05,090
real health concerns that all evidence

1827
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:07,520
thus far seems to point to black market

1828
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:09,420
products I haven't seen I haven't read a

1829
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:12,300
lot that suggests

1830
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:13,920
the legal THC and/or tobacco products

1831
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:16,199
were costly they may be in others lot

1832
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,789
yet to learn but we certainly know that

1833
01:11:16,198 --> 01:11:24,299
some of these black market products have

1834
01:11:17,789 --> 01:11:28,829
caused some damage so do you agree or do

1835
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:32,000
you not agree based on your work that

1836
01:11:28,829 --> 01:11:35,448
regulatory oversight education taxation

1837
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,439
wouldn't be a good direction to go for

1838
01:11:35,448 --> 01:11:39,539
ecigs just as we've done with

1839
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:41,639
traditional tobacco or do you share the

1840
01:11:39,539 --> 01:11:43,289
view that we ought to do something

1841
01:11:41,640 --> 01:12:02,910
entirely different and do more of a

1842
01:11:43,289 --> 01:12:05,010
prohibition style ban on products well I

1843
01:12:02,909 --> 01:12:06,809
think this is personally and I'm just

1844
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:09,390
speaking for myself I mean I think this

1845
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:11,190
is something I mean vaping is so new all

1846
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:13,410
these health effects and health harms

1847
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:17,129
are just growing we have to look at

1848
01:12:13,409 --> 01:12:19,920
every single option I mean for sure to

1849
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:23,100
control whatever we can is most

1850
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:25,260
important I think we're learning even to

1851
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,850
in you know as a provider the opiate

1852
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:28,289
epidemic is very much

1853
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:30,300
on all of our minds and this is

1854
01:12:28,289 --> 01:12:32,698
something we are tasked very heavily to

1855
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:36,210
do and that was under a medical model

1856
01:12:32,698 --> 01:12:38,279
and not a market model so even that you

1857
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:40,500
know we know that there are addictions

1858
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:42,119
is a very challenging thing that people

1859
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:44,670
get it from many different sources and a

1860
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:49,649
comprehensive approach is very much

1861
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:53,609
needed and I would say the same in

1862
01:12:49,649 --> 01:12:57,089
regards to the type of work that's being

1863
01:12:53,609 --> 01:12:59,309
done we know and we look back to 2009 we

1864
01:12:57,090 --> 01:13:02,429
know that when we remove flavors from

1865
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:05,250
cigarettes here in California every

1866
01:13:02,429 --> 01:13:06,539
population had a decrease in cigarette

1867
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,948
consumption with the exception of

1868
01:13:06,539 --> 01:13:10,319
African Americans who have the highest

1869
01:13:07,948 --> 01:13:12,000
rates of methylated use so we know that

1870
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:14,460
there was a positive impact by removing

1871
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,500
those flavored products and so it could

1872
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:18,329
only be assumed that when we look at the

1873
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,850
two different issues and I agree with

1874
01:13:18,329 --> 01:13:22,939
dr. wood that we have an issue

1875
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:25,460
you thing and that increasing and then

1876
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:27,229
we have the issue of the illnesses but

1877
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:30,170
looking specifically at the youth vaping

1878
01:13:27,229 --> 01:13:32,000
side that removing youth friendly

1879
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:35,029
products and flavored products from the

1880
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,939
market would have an impact on youth use

1881
01:13:35,029 --> 01:13:40,069
of the products and eventually their

1882
01:13:37,939 --> 01:13:41,539
transition to other tobacco products

1883
01:13:40,069 --> 01:13:44,689
down the road which is what the research

1884
01:13:41,539 --> 01:13:47,390
is showing us I tend to agree with that

1885
01:13:44,689 --> 01:13:49,549
comment which is why we designed the

1886
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:52,220
bill that we were working on to reflect

1887
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:54,050
tobacco exactly which is banning flavors

1888
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:58,520
outside of traditional tobacco flavors

1889
01:13:54,050 --> 01:14:00,829
menthol and and traditional tobacco so

1890
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:04,100
that did work and seems like could work

1891
01:14:00,829 --> 01:14:06,289
again the other efforts on flavors are

1892
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:10,100
different than what you just described

1893
01:14:06,289 --> 01:14:12,260
the other question I had is the

1894
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:13,820
availability and popularity of nicorette

1895
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:15,730
and the reason asked the question is

1896
01:14:13,819 --> 01:14:19,359
what when I first learned about the

1897
01:14:15,729 --> 01:14:22,759
e-cigarette vaping abduch I went and

1898
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:24,829
wanted to see all of these crazy flavors

1899
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:27,710
right like Captain Crunch and bubblegum

1900
01:14:24,829 --> 01:14:30,739
this and I screamed that and so I went

1901
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:33,920
to the jewel website and started looking

1902
01:14:30,739 --> 01:14:35,510
they didn't find any of them I had been

1903
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,069
told all there's always crazy you know

1904
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:42,980
fifteen thousand flavors and so I'm on

1905
01:14:37,069 --> 01:14:44,719
the website and found fruit mint and

1906
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:46,699
several others and then I looked at a

1907
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:51,199
couple other company websites and found

1908
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:53,599
similar similar results what struck me

1909
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:55,609
about that is I was familiar through

1910
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:58,160
some friends and family of folks who had

1911
01:14:55,609 --> 01:14:59,539
used Nicorette in the past and it struck

1912
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:03,170
me they were similar to Nicorette

1913
01:14:59,539 --> 01:15:05,810
flavors so I went looked and I was right

1914
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:07,520
there same type of fruit mint same types

1915
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:10,970
of flavors that were offered in these

1916
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:14,390
products why have we not seen an

1917
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:17,090
epidemic of nicorette use amongst teens

1918
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:18,530
if in fact just being logically

1919
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:20,930
consistent that flavors drive

1920
01:15:18,529 --> 01:15:22,219
consumption and teens then I would

1921
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:23,159
assume we should have a Nicorette

1922
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:26,310
epidemic

1923
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:28,619
and I don't believe we have one any

1924
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:32,340
thoughts on that doctor sure

1925
01:15:28,619 --> 01:15:36,180
so usually nicotine gum or lozenge is

1926
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:37,739
usually two milligrams of nicotine we're

1927
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:40,730
talking these dual pods that the

1928
01:15:37,739 --> 01:15:43,979
manufacturer says has like 56 milligrams

1929
01:15:40,729 --> 01:15:47,039
and that's supposed to be the equivalent

1930
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:50,099
of at least one pack of cigarettes so

1931
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:51,750
when you're having flavors flavors is

1932
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:54,570
just one part it's the marketing and

1933
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:57,239
it's also the taste that masks maybe

1934
01:15:54,569 --> 01:15:59,189
whatever bitterness even in Nick

1935
01:15:57,239 --> 01:16:00,569
nicotine gum or lozenge you know

1936
01:15:59,189 --> 01:16:03,000
patients say there's some peppery taste

1937
01:16:00,569 --> 01:16:06,750
that bothers them and the mint numbs it

1938
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,010
and it masks that so I think we're talk

1939
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:11,220
that's why we're talking about the high

1940
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:14,940
potency nicotine plus the flavor the

1941
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:18,510
appeal of flavors and that combination I

1942
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:20,729
think is something that's way different

1943
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:24,210
from these vaping products than with the

1944
01:16:20,729 --> 01:16:27,419
medication that the FDA oversees for

1945
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:29,430
quitting tobacco and if I can just add

1946
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:31,079
to that so a couple of other points so

1947
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:33,450
in the newest data that we have it's

1948
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:35,069
still preliminary data but from the

1949
01:16:33,449 --> 01:16:36,659
National Youth tobacco survey we've seen

1950
01:16:35,069 --> 01:16:38,819
an increase a significant increase in

1951
01:16:36,659 --> 01:16:41,849
youth use of mentholated vaping devices

1952
01:16:38,819 --> 01:16:45,179
and meant vaping devices and a decrease

1953
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:47,039
in fruit and candy is significantly

1954
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:50,490
lower so we are getting to a point where

1955
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:53,159
young people are switching to mint or

1956
01:16:50,489 --> 01:16:54,689
starting with mint products on the

1957
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:56,369
Nicorette industry procs you talked

1958
01:16:54,689 --> 01:17:00,389
about vaping products not not gun

1959
01:16:56,369 --> 01:17:03,119
correct so on the on the gum side so it

1960
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:04,800
is there is no standard for use of

1961
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:07,559
nicotine replacement therapy products

1962
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,989
for use with minors those products are

1963
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:12,600
not marketed to minors and so when we

1964
01:17:09,989 --> 01:17:14,579
look at Jul who I think we can call them

1965
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:16,350
out for and they're currently again

1966
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:18,750
under investigation for the practices of

1967
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:21,329
the marketing that they did due to youth

1968
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:22,020
specifically and so that's a huge

1969
01:17:21,329 --> 01:17:25,289
difference

1970
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:27,510
is that access to these products they're

1971
01:17:25,289 --> 01:17:30,090
a lot more attractive to youth and gum

1972
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:32,640
that's being promoted by providers and

1973
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:34,409
then also the invasive marketing of

1974
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:36,240
these new devices on social

1975
01:17:34,409 --> 01:17:38,279
media sites and specifically to youth

1976
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:40,649
and young adults so that might point us

1977
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:44,369
back in the direction of restrictions on

1978
01:17:40,649 --> 01:17:46,199
marketing education taxation increased

1979
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:50,189
oversight and penalties all those things

1980
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:52,199
that might dial in on accessing those

1981
01:17:50,189 --> 01:17:55,409
products make it more similar to a

1982
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:58,769
Nicorette product that's more

1983
01:17:55,409 --> 01:18:01,199
restrictive in its availability but also

1984
01:17:58,770 --> 01:18:03,840
just to follow up on your thought doctor

1985
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:06,000
brings up and we did not discuss this at

1986
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:08,730
least not that I'm aware of and perhaps

1987
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:13,109
some other chairs or members did discuss

1988
01:18:08,729 --> 01:18:15,239
it was the focusing on the nicotine

1989
01:18:13,109 --> 01:18:17,039
content which I think you bring up this

1990
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:19,939
kind of excessive nicotine content maybe

1991
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:23,130
maybe we need to focus taxation

1992
01:18:19,939 --> 01:18:25,109
moratorium prohibition provisions on

1993
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:27,000
example on the amount of nicotine

1994
01:18:25,109 --> 01:18:28,889
contained in a product that's something

1995
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,140
we haven't looked at but do you think

1996
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:33,869
that might be an effective Avenue to go

1997
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:37,110
down worth exploring

1998
01:18:33,869 --> 01:18:41,099
on the e-liquids and trying to

1999
01:18:37,109 --> 01:18:43,409
understand what's in them and also you

2000
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:46,140
know we know people are price responsive

2001
01:18:43,409 --> 01:18:47,430
so that is I mean the closest we got to

2002
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:49,050
that I know the bill that I was working

2003
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:52,170
on some of my colleagues we were we were

2004
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:54,270
looking at a taxation approach that

2005
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:58,829
would have been based off of the

2006
01:18:54,270 --> 01:19:00,030
nicotine content in the product so I'm

2007
01:18:58,829 --> 01:19:04,340
gonna go back and take another look at

2008
01:19:00,029 --> 01:19:07,800
that based on your comments here today I

2009
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:09,810
think also just to note just like with

2010
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,220
the tar you know whatever's registering

2011
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:13,680
in the Machine we still need to learn

2012
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:15,079
what's actually going on with the humans

2013
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:18,420
as well

2014
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:21,050
and my final my final question I wasn't

2015
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:24,659
sure I heard your answers on prohibition

2016
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:26,850
you're for a prohibition or a ban versus

2017
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:28,680
regular regulation oversight taxes I

2018
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:31,770
kind of laid that out there and I didn't

2019
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:33,930
hear you guys answer that as a provider

2020
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:36,150
I'm not sure that's usually my realm

2021
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:38,039
like and I'm here to educate about that

2022
01:19:36,149 --> 01:19:39,689
question I just curious on your

2023
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:42,720
you know opinion given your involvement

2024
01:19:39,689 --> 01:19:44,849
oh well I think time is telling that

2025
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:48,840
these products are not safe and so it's

2026
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:50,730
worth looking at every angle that we're

2027
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,860
understanding these with the vaping

2028
01:19:50,729 --> 01:19:56,219
associated pulmonary injury we still

2029
01:19:52,859 --> 01:19:59,549
have a lot to learn that you know if the

2030
01:19:56,220 --> 01:20:03,390
CDC is saying to stop vaping you know

2031
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:05,130
what are our options so I don't know

2032
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:08,579
that that's called prohibition but I

2033
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:11,760
think it's called how do we act for

2034
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:15,720
public health thank you for your time

2035
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:17,630
thank you what thank you very much

2036
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,940
a few questions follow up

2037
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:24,390
[Music]

2038
01:20:19,939 --> 01:20:26,369
I'll just one comment to comment and mr.

2039
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:28,890
green I agree and disagree on things and

2040
01:20:26,369 --> 01:20:32,640
so I may or may not be obvious people

2041
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:33,780
but that's okay but but but he pointed

2042
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:37,470
out that you know we talked about

2043
01:20:33,779 --> 01:20:39,300
banning the 14,000 997 flavors and still

2044
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:41,280
leaving others out there but my

2045
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:43,050
understanding from tobacco free kids is

2046
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:45,859
that when you leave mint and menthol on

2047
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:48,570
the table you still got 50 percent

2048
01:20:45,859 --> 01:20:51,719
that's the preference for 50 percent of

2049
01:20:48,569 --> 01:20:54,630
users so so that's to me is a is kind of

2050
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:56,190
a problem and so and that's that's data

2051
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:57,840
that was fairly recent that came out in

2052
01:20:56,189 --> 01:20:59,879
August I believe so

2053
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,890
so I mean my numbers may not be exact

2054
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:04,380
but I think mint was somewhere around 32

2055
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:06,030
percent and then you add menthol in

2056
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:08,130
there and the numbers still high so in

2057
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:10,050
other words that's why rule that's why

2058
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:14,039
mr. McCarty and I particularly looking

2059
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:15,989
at a ban on all flavors but so but what

2060
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:17,939
we're talking about the FDA and safety

2061
01:21:15,989 --> 01:21:21,420
and you mentioned tea corpse or tea

2062
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:24,389
course tea course it seems kind of

2063
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:27,539
counter intuitive productive it seems

2064
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:29,660
wrong that we would ask the industry to

2065
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:33,989
provide us with its safety data

2066
01:21:29,659 --> 01:21:36,239
considering the history of the industry

2067
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:39,029
and how they've been deceptive on

2068
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:43,679
tobacco throughout the time tobacco has

2069
01:21:39,029 --> 01:21:45,809
been out there so I failed to see why

2070
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:49,050
you know yes the FDA is pushing that up

2071
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:51,720
but how do we get other data out there

2072
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:53,159
that isn't potentially bias it feels a

2073
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:55,980
little like the fox guarding the hen

2074
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:56,760
house quite frankly and it just it feels

2075
01:21:55,979 --> 01:21:59,399
backwards

2076
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:03,390
especially in this arena with a history

2077
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:05,729
of not being truthful on on issues why

2078
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:08,760
would we then take the same people and

2079
01:22:05,729 --> 01:22:10,279
have them have them you know conduct the

2080
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:14,520
research and then say oh yeah

2081
01:22:10,279 --> 01:22:16,139
this is this is safe yes well there are

2082
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:18,210
a lot of contradictions in the history

2083
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:21,150
of tobacco control and I think where

2084
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:24,359
this whole vaping epidemic is making us

2085
01:22:21,149 --> 01:22:27,289
try to examine everything from a from

2086
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:30,269
what we know and what we're seeing now I

2087
01:22:27,289 --> 01:22:34,109
just want to point out that some of

2088
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:36,510
these tea cores are very can serve as in

2089
01:22:34,109 --> 01:22:38,609
terms of independent review so I've had

2090
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:42,239
colleagues at UC San Francisco where

2091
01:22:38,609 --> 01:22:44,579
there's a new product that called IKOS

2092
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:47,219
that is a heat not burn product it's not

2093
01:22:44,579 --> 01:22:49,079
vaping it's heating and they just got

2094
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:52,590
FDA they submitted through the FDA

2095
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:54,869
approval to market and the folks at

2096
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:57,239
these centers looked at the data

2097
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:59,189
independently and came to some different

2098
01:22:57,239 --> 01:23:02,069
conclusions so for example this product

2099
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:03,899
that heats not burns tobacco versus

2100
01:23:02,069 --> 01:23:06,420
regular cigarettes when they looked at

2101
01:23:03,899 --> 01:23:09,420
the industry data they showed there was

2102
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:13,380
actually two hundred to a thousand

2103
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:15,810
percent higher of over 50 constituents

2104
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,489
out of a hundred chemical constituents

2105
01:23:15,810 --> 01:23:19,160
in this heat not burn product compared

2106
01:23:17,489 --> 01:23:21,920
to regular cigarettes and even higher

2107
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:24,449
liver function tests liver inflammation

2108
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:28,050
from blood tests than regular cigarettes

2109
01:23:24,449 --> 01:23:31,260
so I think these tea cores that are help

2110
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:33,570
to that are helping the FDA understand

2111
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:36,360
what is important data for regulatory

2112
01:23:33,569 --> 01:23:38,429
science play very critical roles but

2113
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:42,149
they are not industry they're typically

2114
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:45,300
universities that are providing data and

2115
01:23:42,149 --> 01:23:47,869
also can help with independent review of

2116
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,869
data as well

2117
01:23:48,658 --> 01:23:52,948
in the interest of time I do have some

2118
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:55,440
other comments and I'm gonna hit on them

2119
01:23:52,948 --> 01:23:57,029
but but I know we've got a lot of big

2120
01:23:55,439 --> 01:23:59,069
agenda ahead of us here I think you know

2121
01:23:57,029 --> 01:24:01,408
with regards to mr. Lowe's you talked

2122
01:23:59,069 --> 01:24:03,179
about the really small number of cities

2123
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:04,979
and that have actually taken action I

2124
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:06,750
think in a short amount of time the fact

2125
01:24:04,979 --> 01:24:08,519
that almost 10% of California cities

2126
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:10,679
have taken some action on flavors I

2127
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:13,620
think is significant and I think you're

2128
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:14,940
gonna see that number grow if there is

2129
01:24:13,619 --> 01:24:17,340
an action from either the federal

2130
01:24:14,939 --> 01:24:19,979
government or the state so I think part

2131
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:21,270
of that is is just people saying whoa we

2132
01:24:19,979 --> 01:24:22,799
got a problem here we need to do

2133
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:24,420
something and maybe it's not the right

2134
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,449
thing to do but it's better than doing

2135
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:29,579
nothing at all and so I think that that

2136
01:24:27,448 --> 01:24:31,259
you're gonna see more and more of that I

2137
01:24:29,579 --> 01:24:33,119
to hear that is like the number one

2138
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:34,739
issue in school vaping and it isn't

2139
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:37,109
distinguish being vaping tobacco and

2140
01:24:34,738 --> 01:24:38,968
vaping cannabis it's vaping it's all

2141
01:24:37,109 --> 01:24:41,299
lumped together it is then it is the

2142
01:24:38,969 --> 01:24:43,408
number one issue I hear from from people

2143
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:45,449
we have done a marvelous job on

2144
01:24:43,408 --> 01:24:46,979
education related tobacco I think it

2145
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:49,319
shows by the number of the percentage

2146
01:24:46,979 --> 01:24:52,439
and how that actual traditional tobacco

2147
01:24:49,319 --> 01:24:55,259
use had continued to go down but the the

2148
01:24:52,439 --> 01:24:57,599
stark change between 2017 and 18 and

2149
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:59,159
then now into nineteen I gotta wonder if

2150
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:01,289
it isn't just because of the trendy

2151
01:24:59,158 --> 01:25:04,439
little device those original devices

2152
01:25:01,289 --> 01:25:06,600
were pretty clunky and big and hard to

2153
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:08,638
hide and mom and see that what the heck

2154
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:10,739
is this thing but it's hard it's a much

2155
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:13,350
easier conceal something like like the

2156
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:15,299
Joule devices and so that makes it cool

2157
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:18,120
and I wonder how much of that is an

2158
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:22,230
issue I think now we're also we are

2159
01:25:18,119 --> 01:25:24,389
hearing now that that in the public

2160
01:25:22,229 --> 01:25:26,750
health emergency I'll call it right now

2161
01:25:24,389 --> 01:25:30,020
with the illnesses that are happening

2162
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:32,850
kids are taking a more cautious approach

2163
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:34,800
about that some kids anyway

2164
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:36,630
females more than males because I think

2165
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:40,320
guys thing to think they're invincible

2166
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:43,079
period and so I think that there are

2167
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:44,670
there at least from new New Starts and

2168
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:47,309
those that are currently are

2169
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:49,079
quote-unquote addicted continue to do

2170
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:52,289
that because it's an addiction it's it's

2171
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:54,869
a it's almost impossible to walk away

2172
01:25:52,289 --> 01:25:56,579
from I think one of the challenges that

2173
01:25:54,869 --> 01:25:58,500
we face in the education certainly in

2174
01:25:56,579 --> 01:26:00,210
the cannabis space is the promise of

2175
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:02,880
prot 64 was revenue

2176
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:05,430
or that and we have a time lag now and

2177
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:08,819
the revenue isn't what we expected from

2178
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:11,010
the taxes and so we're kind of a little

2179
01:26:08,819 --> 01:26:12,149
bit behind the scenes on that from my

2180
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:14,940
perspective and we do have programs

2181
01:26:12,149 --> 01:26:16,259
either so maybe we piggyback off of the

2182
01:26:14,939 --> 01:26:19,500
successful programs that you've been

2183
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:21,750
talking about but the resources to move

2184
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:24,359
that haven't haven't been as available

2185
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:28,949
yet it is interesting I have a son who's

2186
01:26:24,359 --> 01:26:31,170
now 23 he said in in throughout middle

2187
01:26:28,949 --> 01:26:33,059
school and high school that cannabis was

2188
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:36,390
much more accessible and much more

2189
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:38,160
consumed than tobacco once and so the

2190
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:40,860
numbers that you're talking about usage

2191
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:43,170
doesn't surprise me too much based on

2192
01:26:40,859 --> 01:26:46,289
that and what I hear from from other

2193
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:50,880
from other people so in as far as

2194
01:26:46,289 --> 01:26:54,329
taxation whether we were taxing nicotine

2195
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:56,279
products or cannabis products maybe even

2196
01:26:54,329 --> 01:26:58,380
you know labeling you know different

2197
01:26:56,279 --> 01:27:00,509
labels and you know maybe we go at some

2198
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:02,279
point - I think there's isn't there some

2199
01:27:00,510 --> 01:27:04,590
sort of a there's like a sticker or

2200
01:27:02,279 --> 01:27:06,659
something on tobacco products it's decks

2201
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:09,180
maybe we go that way with cannabis at

2202
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:11,488
some point but that doesn't help us with

2203
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:13,950
the illicit market and so that I think

2204
01:27:11,488 --> 01:27:15,479
is that that will continue to be that

2205
01:27:13,949 --> 01:27:17,219
will help distinguish between the two

2206
01:27:15,479 --> 01:27:19,529
markets but I don't know that that helps

2207
01:27:17,219 --> 01:27:22,500
us with the illicit market until there's

2208
01:27:19,529 --> 01:27:23,969
better enforcement so it's more so if

2209
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:26,069
you want to comment I threw a lot out

2210
01:27:23,969 --> 01:27:28,020
there I'm sorry yeah most it wasn't a

2211
01:27:26,069 --> 01:27:30,119
question so well thank you for your

2212
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:32,310
comments I do have to follow comments so

2213
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:35,010
one is on the cool factor of these

2214
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:37,410
devices certainly it's very cool we work

2215
01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:39,270
with young people who are engaged in

2216
01:27:37,409 --> 01:27:42,809
working on these ordinances in their

2217
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:45,030
local communities and they have come and

2218
01:27:42,810 --> 01:27:46,920
shared with us that they shy away from

2219
01:27:45,029 --> 01:27:49,800
telling their peers what they're working

2220
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:52,230
on because it's not cool to be an anti

2221
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:54,270
tobacco person right now because vaping

2222
01:27:52,229 --> 01:27:56,609
has become the norm so that's an issue

2223
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:58,380
but the issue is that even if it was

2224
01:27:56,609 --> 01:28:00,049
just a cool trend for a little bit it's

2225
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:02,760
a cool trend with a highly addictive

2226
01:28:00,050 --> 01:28:04,500
solution so now young people are

2227
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:05,789
addicted so even if they don't want to

2228
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,130
use it anymore as you had mentioned this

2229
01:28:05,789 --> 01:28:08,260
is an

2230
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:09,819
addiction not a habit and so now we're

2231
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:11,980
dealing with something that was cool who

2232
01:28:09,819 --> 01:28:14,049
has created a new generation of nicotine

2233
01:28:11,979 --> 01:28:15,309
addicts so that's a big issue the other

2234
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:17,739
thing we've been talking a lot about

2235
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:20,080
vaping as that's the intent of this

2236
01:28:17,739 --> 01:28:23,050
hearing but also just to note that the

2237
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:25,840
flavors that we saw cigarette smoking

2238
01:28:23,050 --> 01:28:27,880
going down over the last many years and

2239
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:30,819
much of that can be attributed to FDA

2240
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:32,170
and removing the flavors it can be

2241
01:28:30,819 --> 01:28:34,119
attributed to the amazing work that's

2242
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:35,890
happened here in California but it's

2243
01:28:34,119 --> 01:28:38,289
important to note that tobacco use of

2244
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:39,880
other products was not changing or was

2245
01:28:38,289 --> 01:28:41,619
increasing with you thinking adults and

2246
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:44,470
that's the other flavor tobacco products

2247
01:28:41,619 --> 01:28:47,050
and oftentimes young people will smoke

2248
01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:50,170
their marijuana with a flavored cigar

2249
01:28:47,050 --> 01:28:52,869
wrapper and so the connection there is

2250
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:55,060
all of the flavored tobacco it's not

2251
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:56,920
simply flavored nicotine solutions it's

2252
01:28:55,060 --> 01:29:01,180
an issue with young people it's the

2253
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:02,949
flavoring in all of the products so it

2254
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:05,619
seems our comments have drawn up more

2255
01:29:02,949 --> 01:29:08,349
questions so yeah mr. McCarty and then

2256
01:29:05,619 --> 01:29:09,909
mr. Rivas yeah well the first thing

2257
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:13,329
about the cities I just wanted to

2258
01:29:09,909 --> 01:29:15,309
mention dr. what is is there's 10% right

2259
01:29:13,329 --> 01:29:18,550
now but I would say the population wise

2260
01:29:15,310 --> 01:29:21,190
it's probably close to 25 30 with la San

2261
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:22,869
Francisco LA County the city of LA on

2262
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:25,569
the verge and other big cities and so

2263
01:29:22,869 --> 01:29:27,119
some of the rules are different so

2264
01:29:25,569 --> 01:29:29,500
that's one thing like we saw with

2265
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:31,059
plastic bags and menu labeling if we

2266
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:33,310
have all these jurisdictions with

2267
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:35,260
slightly different laws it's mass

2268
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:36,940
confusion for consumers and I with the

2269
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:39,909
industry is probably enough let's have

2270
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:41,979
one statewide policy I think that's

2271
01:29:39,909 --> 01:29:44,710
important but on the tax can regulation

2272
01:29:41,979 --> 01:29:47,079
I get what you're what you're saying

2273
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:49,319
chairman gray but there's some products

2274
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:51,909
that you know when there's moderate use

2275
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:55,599
taxing regulation oversight makes sense

2276
01:29:51,909 --> 01:29:59,409
like alcohol moderate use we don't tax

2277
01:29:55,600 --> 01:30:01,300
it regulate and have a policy for

2278
01:29:59,409 --> 01:30:05,199
cocaine heroin and methamphetamine

2279
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:08,710
because we know it's unsafe for any set

2280
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:10,479
subset of humans kids especially I think

2281
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:11,710
the safety thing is the question here

2282
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:14,139
and one thing we never talked about you

2283
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:16,630
don't ask you last question here is is

2284
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:17,590
that the tobacco miner setting is very

2285
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:20,289
different than this

2286
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:22,539
the nicotine the high dosage have a huge

2287
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:24,219
impact on young people on their

2288
01:30:22,539 --> 01:30:27,279
development there's still there the

2289
01:30:24,219 --> 01:30:29,109
depression anxiety and behavioral issues

2290
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:31,289
and there was one young man that's suing

2291
01:30:29,109 --> 01:30:34,029
Jul talking about what it led to his

2292
01:30:31,289 --> 01:30:37,090
lifestyle change and that's a public

2293
01:30:34,029 --> 01:30:39,009
health issue that has cost upon society

2294
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:40,300
and healthcare costs and so you know

2295
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:43,329
that piece we haven't really talked

2296
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:45,579
about yet is that the impact it has just

2297
01:30:43,329 --> 01:30:47,469
on the actual young people so you

2298
01:30:45,579 --> 01:30:50,618
mentioned talked about that for say oh

2299
01:30:47,469 --> 01:30:52,179
yes so I think when the Surgeon General

2300
01:30:50,618 --> 01:30:55,059
is talking about the developing brain is

2301
01:30:52,179 --> 01:30:56,560
also addressing mental health issues and

2302
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:59,560
I thank you for bringing that up

2303
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:01,119
and it's nicotine and marijuana's and

2304
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:02,980
it's not to say that it does it's not

2305
01:31:01,118 --> 01:31:05,170
important for older people it's just

2306
01:31:02,979 --> 01:31:09,129
that this is especially important for

2307
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:11,800
the next generation so I think those are

2308
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:13,868
very excellent points you bring up that

2309
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,690
it's not just physical health and you

2310
01:31:13,868 --> 01:31:18,519
know these pulmonary injury cases are

2311
01:31:15,689 --> 01:31:21,029
alarming but there's you know it's the

2312
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:25,929
whole person that we need to look at

2313
01:31:21,029 --> 01:31:30,009
thank you yeah so I appreciate the

2314
01:31:25,929 --> 01:31:31,179
information you know I come from prior

2315
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:33,760
to my time in the assembly I was a

2316
01:31:31,179 --> 01:31:36,039
school discipline manager so I saw this

2317
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:39,219
epidemic right before my eyes I saw

2318
01:31:36,039 --> 01:31:41,229
anything and everything you know and so

2319
01:31:39,219 --> 01:31:43,359
obviously this is a very complex issue

2320
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:45,098
in a discussion we probably make it

2321
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:48,309
worse by all the dialogue you've heard

2322
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:49,389
up here quite made more complex but

2323
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:51,010
certainly seems like we're racing

2324
01:31:49,389 --> 01:31:53,920
against the clock it seems like this

2325
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:55,690
epidemic is getting worse day by day and

2326
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,849
based on all this conversation up here

2327
01:31:55,689 --> 01:32:00,750
it's you know very easy to get lost in

2328
01:31:57,849 --> 01:32:03,730
the weeds of this complex issue and

2329
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:07,118
there's obviously a lot that we do not

2330
01:32:03,729 --> 01:32:08,259
know but based on what we do know we do

2331
01:32:07,118 --> 01:32:11,019
know that there is a public health

2332
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:13,090
problem that there's a crisis right that

2333
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:14,830
we have was it more than a thousand

2334
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:18,029
cases of lung illness that have been

2335
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:20,979
reported in people under 35 years of age

2336
01:32:18,029 --> 01:32:25,000
60% of those patients are under 18 years

2337
01:32:20,979 --> 01:32:27,750
old 21% are between 18 and 20 years of

2338
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:31,140
age and as of this morning 29 deaths

2339
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:32,850
related to this and in in you know

2340
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:33,720
obviously as I mention it's easy to get

2341
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:35,370
in the weeds based on this conversation

2342
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:36,780
we talk about enforcement we could talk

2343
01:32:35,369 --> 01:32:40,640
about flavors and on flavors we could

2344
01:32:36,779 --> 01:32:43,340
talk about THC we talked about you know

2345
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:46,140
the nicotine we talked about taxation

2346
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:48,390
but the only thing we can that we really

2347
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:53,789
do know the one thing we can point to is

2348
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:54,990
that the relate the the the the the one

2349
01:32:53,789 --> 01:32:56,369
thing we could point to relate to the

2350
01:32:54,989 --> 01:33:00,539
cause of all these illnesses and the

2351
01:32:56,369 --> 01:33:02,399
deaths is vaping that all reported

2352
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:06,300
patients have a history of using vapor

2353
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:08,729
products right and so to me standing up

2354
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:10,079
here we've got all the information we

2355
01:33:08,729 --> 01:33:11,669
look at what other states are doing we

2356
01:33:10,079 --> 01:33:15,059
know it you know our governor did

2357
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:17,550
through executive action but it seems to

2358
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:20,130
me an absent a complete van of all

2359
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:23,820
vaping products the flavor not flavor

2360
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:26,250
all vaping products nothing is going to

2361
01:33:23,819 --> 01:33:29,009
be in unless we have that nothing is

2362
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:32,130
going to be enough to prevent future

2363
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:36,150
illnesses until we absolutely know what

2364
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:39,539
is causing these illnesses and so you

2365
01:33:36,149 --> 01:33:40,589
know until you know in the meantime that

2366
01:33:39,539 --> 01:33:44,310
we're rolling out all these public

2367
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:46,170
awareness campaigns that we are adopting

2368
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:48,300
regulations and build a policy framework

2369
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:50,760
you know regulatory framework to address

2370
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:55,260
this crisis you know and find the most

2371
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:58,079
effective a solution however many you

2372
01:33:55,260 --> 01:34:02,030
know ideas it's gonna take unless we

2373
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:04,710
have an absolute ban it seems to me that

2374
01:34:02,029 --> 01:34:06,090
we're gonna keep reading about more

2375
01:34:04,710 --> 01:34:09,060
illnesses we're gonna keep reading about

2376
01:34:06,090 --> 01:34:11,159
more deaths aside from the public health

2377
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:13,410
cost impact the treatment of some of

2378
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:18,059
these people is going to be astronomical

2379
01:34:13,409 --> 01:34:20,189
and I represent a rural area where we

2380
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:21,800
are you know we lack health care

2381
01:34:20,189 --> 01:34:24,539
services and so understanding

2382
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:26,970
availability of treatment let alone the

2383
01:34:24,539 --> 01:34:30,060
cost is a problem so absent so I guess

2384
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:33,150
my question is absent a complete ban you

2385
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:35,490
know this is only gonna get worse is

2386
01:34:33,149 --> 01:34:36,828
that true or not true or I you know I

2387
01:34:35,489 --> 01:34:40,819
don't know

2388
01:34:36,828 --> 01:34:43,069
I think I'll comment that every week my

2389
01:34:40,819 --> 01:34:46,609
slides are outdated because these cases

2390
01:34:43,069 --> 01:34:48,349
are rising and this is these are young

2391
01:34:46,609 --> 01:34:50,210
people who can some of them as you're

2392
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:52,099
noting hospitalized in the ICU very

2393
01:34:50,210 --> 01:34:53,719
expensive cost of care they're lucky

2394
01:34:52,099 --> 01:34:55,880
they're young because they can walk out

2395
01:34:53,719 --> 01:35:00,408
the people who are dying are middle-aged

2396
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:02,599
you know how do we stop this I think

2397
01:35:00,408 --> 01:35:05,808
this is this is why we're coming

2398
01:35:02,599 --> 01:35:07,578
together today but to anticipate the

2399
01:35:05,809 --> 01:35:09,920
health professions are going to be able

2400
01:35:07,578 --> 01:35:13,069
to take care of this it has to be more

2401
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:16,399
upstream and as I think everyone's noted

2402
01:35:13,069 --> 01:35:18,439
today a very comprehensive approach you

2403
01:35:16,399 --> 01:35:20,539
know I think it's the cats out of the

2404
01:35:18,439 --> 01:35:25,210
bag already and you know what can we all

2405
01:35:20,539 --> 01:35:25,210
do together to help control the epidemic

2406
01:35:26,408 --> 01:35:32,000
thank you thank you both very much for

2407
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:35,380

the health risks of vaping both in

2467
01:37:42,619 --> 01:37:49,010
purposes of including nicotine content

2468
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:51,139
in the calculation of taxes for today no

2469
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:53,180
recommend he no recommendations have

2470
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:55,880
been finalized at this time and we

2471
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:58,340
continue to explore all comprehensive

2472
01:37:55,880 --> 01:38:00,650
off set of options as we look to address

2473
01:37:58,340 --> 01:38:02,750
this issue we will release an

2474
01:38:00,649 --> 01:38:04,909
advertising campaign dissuading young

2475
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:06,710
people from vaping raising awareness of

2476
01:38:04,909 --> 01:38:09,079
the new outbreak associated with vaping

2477
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:11,930
and denormalizing all tobacco use in

2478
01:38:09,079 --> 01:38:16,460
california and that campaign is set to

2479
01:38:11,930 --> 01:38:19,159
start next week as you heard this this

2480
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:20,869
afternoon from the first panel the

2481
01:38:19,159 --> 01:38:23,389
numbers around youth vaping are very

2482
01:38:20,869 --> 01:38:25,460
concerning in 2018 the high school

2483
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:27,770
smoking prevalence in California was 2%

2484
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:29,569
compared to 8% nationally but we're

2485
01:38:27,770 --> 01:38:31,850
afraid that progress is going to go the

2486
01:38:29,569 --> 01:38:34,130
other way at the same time we are seeing

2487
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:36,020
this alarming rise in the number of

2488
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:38,600
school-age children using electronic

2489
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:40,340
cigarettes e-cigarettes were the most

2490
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:42,380
commonly used tobacco product among

2491
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:44,480
California high school students eighty

2492
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:46,609
six point four percent of high schools

2493
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:49,159
tobacco users reported using a flavored

2494
01:38:46,609 --> 01:38:51,619
tobacco product the cost of smoking in

2495
01:38:49,159 --> 01:38:53,930
California is estimated at 18 1 point 1

2496
01:38:51,619 --> 01:38:55,489
billion or four hundred and four

2497
01:38:53,930 --> 01:38:58,010
thousand six hundred and three dollars

2498
01:38:55,489 --> 01:38:58,340
per smoker all Californians are paying

2499
01:38:58,010 --> 01:39:01,130
these

2500
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:03,529
not just the smokers most recently this

2501
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:06,020
vaping outbreak raises greater concerns

2502
01:39:03,529 --> 01:39:09,109
for youth as well as adults in the next

2503
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:10,699

information about the outbreak and the

2506
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:18,619
health impacts so next I want to turn to

2507
01:39:14,899 --> 01:39:20,658
our role in regulating both tobacco and

2508
01:39:18,618 --> 01:39:22,399

2509
01:39:20,658 --> 01:39:24,379
emphasizing that much of the regulatory

2510
01:39:22,399 --> 01:39:26,719

01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:08,219
to age 21 yet in 2018 the statewide rate

2581

01:42:11,368 --> 01:42:20,488
tobacco sales for higher was higher for

2584
01:42:14,519 --> 01:42:22,590
e-cigarettes at 22% now I'm going to

2585
01:42:20,488 --> 01:42:24,328
turn to the a very different role that

2586
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:27,958
we have in man you're manufacturing

2587
01:42:24,328 --> 01:42:31,139
cannabis on the manufactured cannabis

2588
01:42:27,958 --> 01:42:33,359
safety branch is very different in

2589
01:42:31,139 --> 01:42:35,609
contrast in contrast to tobacco control

2590
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:38,248
where the majority of regulatory control

2591
01:42:35,609 --> 01:42:40,408
rusts with the federal FDA California

2592
01:42:38,248 --> 01:42:43,019
regulates nearly every every aspect of

2593
01:42:40,408 --> 01:42:45,058
the state's cannabis industry CDP H

2594
01:42:43,019 --> 01:42:46,800
houses the manufactured cannabis safety

2595
01:42:45,059 --> 01:42:48,628
branch which enforces a strict

2596
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:51,300
regulatory framework established through

2597
01:42:48,628 --> 01:42:53,458
prop 64 medicinal and adult use canvas

2598
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:55,860
regulatory safety act mal curse' and

2599
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:58,168
regulations for cannabis products this

2600
01:42:55,859 --> 01:43:00,029
authority includes general cannabis

2601
01:42:58,168 --> 01:43:01,738
manufacturing oversight packaging and

01:43:00,029 --> 01:43:03,738
labeling advertising and marketing

2603
01:43:01,738 --> 01:43:05,908
manufacturing and regulations read

2604
01:43:03,738 --> 01:43:08,218
regarding prohibited products and

2605
01:43:05,908 --> 01:43:10,469
emergency orders CDP H and other state

2606
01:43:08,219 --> 01:43:13,649
departments and agencies to continue to

2607
01:43:10,469 --> 01:43:15,269
work to bring cannabis businesses into

2608
01:43:13,649 --> 01:43:17,429
the legal marketplace but as we

2609
01:43:15,269 --> 01:43:19,360
acknowledged in the first panel that's

2610
01:43:17,429 --> 01:43:21,399
still a problem

2611
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:23,589
just so you know Marcia has built-in

2612
01:43:21,399 --> 01:43:24,729
provisions that reduce youth access and

2613

01:49:50,199 --> 01:49:52,840
nick murderess i'm the director of the

2781
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:55,449
california department of tax and fee

2782
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:57,429
administration CD TFA

2783
01:49:55,448 --> 01:49:58,779
it's a mouthful to say the California

2784
01:49:57,429 --> 01:50:03,158
Department of tax and fee administration

2785
01:49:58,779 --> 01:50:05,380
so CTFA administers about 37 tax

2786
01:50:03,158 --> 01:50:07,420
programs for the state of California our

2787
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:09,639
largest is the sales and use tax program

2788
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:11,020
but we also administer the tobacco taxes

2789
01:50:09,639 --> 01:50:14,609
for the state as well as the cannabis

2790
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:18,100
taxes today I'll focus on those two

2791
01:50:14,609 --> 01:50:19,839
programs I'd like to first start out by

2792
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:22,300
discussing how those tax programs work

2793
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:24,340
then briefly outline our enforcement

2794
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:27,880
methods and lastly I'll highlight some

2795
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:30,429
of the challenges we face as we crack

2796
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:32,199
down on untaxed and illegal vape

2797
01:50:30,429 --> 01:50:35,859
products both in the tobacco and

2798
01:50:32,198 --> 01:50:38,259
cannabis realms so the tobacco tax

2799
01:50:35,859 --> 01:50:41,109
programs we have three basic categories

2800
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:44,110
of tax programs we administers cigarette

2801
01:50:41,109 --> 01:50:46,509
taxes tobacco product taxes and

2802
01:50:44,109 --> 01:50:50,229
cigarette and tobacco products licensing

2803
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:51,969
fees last year the department brought in

2804
01:50:50,229 --> 01:50:53,799
and administered about seventy four

2805
01:50:51,969 --> 01:50:56,289
point four billion dollars in tax

2806
01:50:53,800 --> 01:51:00,219
revenue of that two point 1 billion

2807
01:50:56,289 --> 01:51:03,368
dollars is related to these tobacco tax

2808
01:51:00,219 --> 01:51:06,850
and fee programs other tobacco products

2809
01:51:03,368 --> 01:51:09,158
which are the non cigarette taxes

2810
01:51:06,850 --> 01:51:14,320
accounted for about 13% of that revenue

2811
01:51:09,158 --> 01:51:17,888
or 281 million dollars in FY 1819 those

2812
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:20,019
are taxes derived from historically it

2813
01:51:17,889 --> 01:51:25,289
was cigars smoking tobacco chewing

2814
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:27,550
tobacco and snuff with prop 56 and 2016

2815
01:51:25,289 --> 01:51:29,469
electronic cigarettes and baked products

2816
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:33,159
were added to that definition of tobacco

2817
01:51:29,469 --> 01:51:37,779
products and so it is only since then

2818
01:51:33,158 --> 01:51:40,118
that we've been taxing those vaping

2819
01:51:37,779 --> 01:51:45,789
products as OTP or other tobacco

2820
01:51:40,118 --> 01:51:48,488
products we estimate that last year the

2821
01:51:45,789 --> 01:51:51,460
tax revenue from those programs from oat

2822
01:51:48,488 --> 01:51:56,109
from vaping products amounted to about

2823
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:57,760
56 million dollars starting next year we

2824
01:51:56,109 --> 01:52:01,198
will have exact numbers as we're

2825
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:04,389
changing our returns to require that

2826
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:08,509
vaping products be separately listed on

2827
01:52:04,389 --> 01:52:11,628
the tax returns the rate on

2828
01:52:08,509 --> 01:52:15,378
OTP including vaping products is set

2829
01:52:11,628 --> 01:52:17,628
based on the tobacco the cigarette tax

2830
01:52:15,378 --> 01:52:19,608
rate so cigarettes are taxed at two

2831
01:52:17,628 --> 01:52:21,918
dollars and 87 cents per pack in the

2832
01:52:19,609 --> 01:52:23,989
state of California now started out as

2833
01:52:21,918 --> 01:52:27,918
three cents back in the 50s and we're up

2834
01:52:23,988 --> 01:52:31,728
to 287 what we do annually is we take

2835
01:52:27,918 --> 01:52:33,738
that 287 and we add 50 cents to it so

2836
01:52:31,729 --> 01:52:36,259
you're at 3 dollars and 37 cents per

2837
01:52:33,738 --> 01:52:38,588
pack we divide that by 20 which is the

2838
01:52:36,259 --> 01:52:42,319
number of cigarettes in a single pack

2839
01:52:38,588 --> 01:52:46,759
you get 16 point eight five cents and

2840
01:52:42,319 --> 01:52:49,429
then we divide that number each year by

2841
01:52:46,759 --> 01:52:54,918
the average weighted cost of a single

2842
01:52:49,429 --> 01:52:56,658
cigarette this year that means that OTP

2843
01:52:54,918 --> 01:52:59,748
including all of these tobacco baked

2844
01:52:56,658 --> 01:53:04,958
products are taxed at a rate of fifty

2845
01:52:59,748 --> 01:53:07,188
nine point two seven percent now one

2846
01:53:04,958 --> 01:53:10,188
curious thing about the way the

2847
01:53:07,189 --> 01:53:11,869
California taxes are set up is that that

2848
01:53:10,189 --> 01:53:14,239
average wholesale cost which is the

2849
01:53:11,868 --> 01:53:17,389
denominator in the equation Rises each

2850
01:53:14,238 --> 01:53:20,058
year because of inflation which means

2851
01:53:17,389 --> 01:53:24,649
that the tax rate on other tobacco

2852
01:53:20,059 --> 01:53:31,059
products actually goes down each year it

2853
01:53:24,649 --> 01:53:34,939
is to me a strange outcome but we have

2854
01:53:31,059 --> 01:53:36,918
anyway in addition to that tax we also

2855
01:53:34,939 --> 01:53:40,069
have the cigarette in tobacco products

2856
01:53:36,918 --> 01:53:43,908
licensing program which licenses

2857
01:53:40,069 --> 01:53:46,609
annually about 31,000 retailers 300

2858
01:53:43,908 --> 01:53:49,068
wholesalers and 800 distributors now on

2859
01:53:46,609 --> 01:53:51,919
the tobacco side of the equation we

2860
01:53:49,069 --> 01:53:54,109
administer the sales and use tax program

2861
01:53:51,918 --> 01:53:55,729
which applies to these tobacco sales as

2862
01:53:54,109 --> 01:53:59,119
well as the excise tax and the

2863
01:53:55,729 --> 01:54:01,489
cultivation tax last fiscal year that

2864
01:53:59,118 --> 01:54:03,108
all of those programs together brought

2865
01:54:01,488 --> 01:54:06,498
in about four hundred and eighty million

2866
01:54:03,109 --> 01:54:09,259
dollars into date since adult legal

2867
01:54:06,498 --> 01:54:10,639
cannabis they've have brought in about

2868
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:14,059
six hundred and thirty seven million

2869
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:16,748
dollars the excise tax is again a very

2870
01:54:14,059 --> 01:54:22,279
complicated one at the moment it's 15%

2871
01:54:16,748 --> 01:54:25,579
based on the wholesale cost plus and

2872
01:54:22,279 --> 01:54:28,009
markup rate that CDT fa determines each

2873
01:54:25,579 --> 01:54:31,100
year which is currently set at 60% so

2874
01:54:28,010 --> 01:54:34,280
it's not a 15% on the actual price paid

2875
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:36,610
by the consumer it could be much less

2876
01:54:34,279 --> 01:54:40,090
than 15% it could be much higher because

2877
01:54:36,609 --> 01:54:43,909
obviously markup the actual markup

2878
01:54:40,090 --> 01:54:45,920
varies in transactions and that anyway

2879
01:54:43,909 --> 01:54:50,869
so those are the tax programs we

2880
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:53,590
administer how we enforce them we have

2881
01:54:50,869 --> 01:54:57,649
three basic methods inspections

2882
01:54:53,590 --> 01:55:00,470
investigations and audits we have ten

2883
01:54:57,649 --> 01:55:05,359
inspection teams dedicated to tobacco

2884
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:07,970
enforcement and now through a BCP last

2885
01:55:05,359 --> 01:55:12,380
year to cannabis enforcement as well

2886
01:55:07,970 --> 01:55:14,600
around the state their job day in and

2887
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:16,430
day out is to do inspections of

2888
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:22,220
retailers to make sure that all of the

2889
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:23,810
products in those stores is tax paid in

2890
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:26,480
the case of cigarettes as was mentioned

2891
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:28,850
earlier all of the tax paid materials

2892
01:55:26,479 --> 01:55:30,979
have stamps every pack of cigarettes in

2893
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:32,870
the state has to have a tax stamp and

2894
01:55:30,979 --> 01:55:34,759
actually the tax is paid when you put

2895
01:55:32,869 --> 01:55:37,609
when the distributor purchases that

2896
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:41,060
stamp and places it on the pack of

2897
01:55:37,609 --> 01:55:43,159
cigarettes for other materials our

2898
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:47,600
inspectors go in and have to ask for the

2899
01:55:43,159 --> 01:55:50,029
invoices and the retailers have to prove

2900
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:51,620
to us that the material is tax paid if

2901
01:55:50,029 --> 01:55:55,729
they can't prove it then we seize the

2902
01:55:51,619 --> 01:55:57,890
material in since July of this year our

2903
01:55:55,729 --> 01:56:01,549
inspectors have done about 2,500

2904
01:55:57,890 --> 01:56:04,760
inspections in the past two months alone

2905
01:56:01,550 --> 01:56:07,789
we've done 146 inspections of vaping

2906
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:09,920
specific retailers of those hundred and

2907
01:56:07,789 --> 01:56:13,159
forty-six we've had 17 seizures of

2908
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:15,710
products amounting to about 290 thousand

2909
01:56:13,159 --> 01:56:18,019
dollars of value now that's on the

2910
01:56:15,710 --> 01:56:22,000
tobacco side of the house on the

2911
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:25,280
cannabis front we've done about 200

2912
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:27,560
inspections since July and participated

2913
01:56:25,279 --> 01:56:31,689
in 75 search warrants as as Laurie

2914
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:33,950
mentioned we partner often with BCC and

2915
01:56:31,689 --> 01:56:35,149
consumer fairs as well as local law

2916
01:56:33,949 --> 01:56:39,019
enforcement all around the state

2917
01:56:35,149 --> 01:56:41,239
in addition to those visits our outreach

2918
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:42,920
program because of the scope of the

2919
01:56:41,239 --> 01:56:45,670
problem we're dealing with we've had our

2920
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:48,279
outreach teams around the state also

2921
01:56:45,670 --> 01:56:54,649
doing cannabis visits they've done about

2922
01:56:48,279 --> 01:56:56,269
758 since July and in those cases we're

2923
01:56:54,649 --> 01:56:59,629
actually visiting not just permit

2924
01:56:56,270 --> 01:57:02,930
holders we're visiting any cannabis

2925
01:56:59,630 --> 01:57:06,500
seller that we can find and do to sites

2926
01:57:02,930 --> 01:57:10,010
like weed maps and others people aren't

2927
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:12,050
hiding their retail activity there are

2928
01:57:10,010 --> 01:57:14,420
some real challenges on both of these

2929
01:57:12,050 --> 01:57:17,560
fronts and I'd like to just address

2930
01:57:14,420 --> 01:57:22,090
those very briefly on the tobacco side

2931
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:24,890
the lack of stamping outside of

2932
01:57:22,090 --> 01:57:26,869
cigarettes is a challenge it's much

2933
01:57:24,890 --> 01:57:29,390
easier to go into a store and see that

2934
01:57:26,869 --> 01:57:34,369
all of the product is stamped and

2935
01:57:29,390 --> 01:57:37,610
actually the stamps contain information

2936
01:57:34,369 --> 01:57:39,369
our inspectors have devices which allow

2937
01:57:37,609 --> 01:57:42,199
them to read the stamps and you can tell

2938
01:57:39,369 --> 01:57:44,539
who the distributor was when it was

2939
01:57:42,199 --> 01:57:48,639
distributed a lot of background

2940
01:57:44,539 --> 01:57:53,810
information on on each of those stamps

2941
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:58,360
also on the vaping side the tax rate is

2942
01:57:53,810 --> 01:58:01,670
lower I think than you would anticipate

2943
01:57:58,359 --> 01:58:04,369
because it because the tax is based on

2944
01:58:01,670 --> 01:58:09,590
the wholesale cost the wholesale cost of

2945
01:58:04,369 --> 01:58:12,859
some of these products is relatively low

2946
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:14,779
and so if a vaping cartridge is the

2947
01:58:12,859 --> 01:58:17,689
equivalent of one pack of cigarettes in

2948
01:58:14,779 --> 01:58:19,819
many instances the tax on a vaping

2949
01:58:17,689 --> 01:58:21,829
cartridge is much less than the two

2950
01:58:19,819 --> 01:58:25,009
dollars and 87 cents tax on a pack of

2951
01:58:21,829 --> 01:58:28,340
cigarettes so that's an issue we're also

2952
01:58:25,010 --> 01:58:30,890
seeing you know there's a very there's a

2953
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:37,489
lot of ease of market entry in the

2954
01:58:30,890 --> 01:58:41,440
vaping sector we've seen people can go

2955
01:58:37,489 --> 01:58:45,699
online order materials for their stores

2956
01:58:41,439 --> 01:58:49,268
they can sell the nicotine liquid

2957
01:58:45,699 --> 01:58:51,670
separately from the other liquid

2958
01:58:49,269 --> 01:58:54,248
and people can mix them at home only the

2959
01:58:51,670 --> 01:58:57,038
nicotine liquid is taxed currently not

2960
01:58:54,248 --> 01:58:58,748
any of the other vaping flavored juices

2961
01:58:57,038 --> 01:59:00,248
if they're sold separately once they're

2962
01:58:58,748 --> 01:59:05,609
combined then it's all taxed but

2963
01:59:00,248 --> 01:59:09,099
otherwise only the nicotine and the

2964
01:59:05,609 --> 01:59:12,670
penalties have historically been pretty

2965
01:59:09,099 --> 01:59:16,869
low for non-compliance and that actually

2966
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:19,118
goes on the cannabis side as well our

2967
01:59:16,868 --> 01:59:22,238
inspectors at least are operating in the

2968
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:23,948
world where the penalties are often

2969
01:59:22,238 --> 01:59:25,959
misdemeanors where it's very difficult

2970
01:59:23,948 --> 01:59:27,960
to get local law enforcement even want

2971
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:31,689
to get involved in a misdemeanor case

2972
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:34,210
and the fines are pretty low even for

2973
01:59:31,689 --> 01:59:37,089
failure to let our inspectors in to

2974
01:59:34,210 --> 01:59:39,609
record see your books you know it's a

2975
01:59:37,090 --> 01:59:40,989
$5,000 fine if somebody's operating on

2976
01:59:39,609 --> 01:59:43,988
the far side of the law and making

2977
01:59:40,988 --> 01:59:46,359
millions of dollars acting illegally the

2978
01:59:43,988 --> 01:59:48,069
prospect of my auditors with their

2979
01:59:46,359 --> 01:59:51,238
pocket protectors showing up and

2980
01:59:48,069 --> 01:59:55,058
knocking on the door and the you know

2981
01:59:51,238 --> 01:59:57,638
potential if a misdemeanor that in some

2982
01:59:55,059 --> 02:00:00,760
cases is going to reduce down to $400 by

2983
01:59:57,639 --> 02:00:04,300
local courts is not a real threat to

2984
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:09,010
many of these folks on the cannabis side

2985
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:12,690
the the illegal market is very large the

2986
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:12,690
way we have traditionally approached

2987
02:00:13,349 --> 02:00:18,788
enforcement is cumbersome and slow it

2988
02:00:17,319 --> 02:00:23,558
relies largely on the criminal justice

2989
02:00:18,788 --> 02:00:25,059
system which is slow and difficult it's

2990
02:00:23,559 --> 02:00:28,449
difficult to build the cases it takes

2991
02:00:25,059 --> 02:00:30,820
time with thousands of illegal operators

2992
02:00:28,448 --> 02:00:34,149
around the state it's not I don't think

2993
02:00:30,819 --> 02:00:35,729
that's a method that serves the state

2994
02:00:34,149 --> 02:00:40,210
best and we're looking at other ways

2995
02:00:35,729 --> 02:00:42,129
other things that we can do and as with

2996
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:45,130
tobacco we're also studying stamping

2997
02:00:42,130 --> 02:00:47,019
we're working currently on a thorough

2998
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:48,248
review in light of the governor's

2999
02:00:47,019 --> 02:00:50,349
executive order which we'll be

3000
02:00:48,248 --> 02:00:55,238
presenting to him at the end of this

3001
02:00:50,349 --> 02:00:57,969
month that will review all of these

3002
02:00:55,238 --> 02:00:59,888
options and see if we can't find a

3003
02:00:57,969 --> 02:01:00,960
better way anyway I look forward to your

3004
02:00:59,889 --> 02:01:03,569
questions

02:01:53,220 --> 02:01:59,100
be speaking to you about the cannabis

3024
02:01:56,100 --> 02:02:03,990
side of the vaping issues well I will

3025
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:07,350
focus my remarks on the tobacco side let

3026
02:02:03,989 --> 02:02:10,229
me say that we're very grateful to have

3027
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:12,450
this hearing because it calls attention

3028
02:02:10,229 --> 02:02:16,379
to what we view is a very important

3029
02:02:12,449 --> 02:02:21,569
public health issue others have already

3030
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:24,390
spoken to the severe health issues that

3031
02:02:21,569 --> 02:02:28,590
have surfaced with the use of vaping

3032
02:02:24,390 --> 02:02:32,130
devices in recent months as well as the

3033
02:02:28,590 --> 02:02:33,690
huge spike in underage use of electronic

3034
02:02:32,130 --> 02:02:36,210
cigarettes I don't think I need to

3035
02:02:33,689 --> 02:02:39,629
repeat that at this time except to

3036
02:02:36,210 --> 02:02:43,460
remind all of us that according to the

3037
02:02:39,630 --> 02:02:46,980
2019 National Youth tobacco survey

3038
02:02:43,460 --> 02:02:48,720
preliminary data we're now nationwide at

3039
02:02:46,979 --> 02:02:51,569
a point where more than one out of four

3040
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:55,140
high school students is using electronic

3041
02:02:51,569 --> 02:02:58,920
cigarettes this is the most popular form

3042
02:02:55,140 --> 02:03:03,960
of tobacco use among young people today

3043
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:07,289
and this is fellow public health

3044
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:11,250
standpoint extremely alarming because it

3045
02:03:07,289 --> 02:03:13,590
threatens to reverse much of the great

3046
02:03:11,250 --> 02:03:18,029
work and progress that has been done

3047
02:03:13,590 --> 02:03:21,060
over many years to reduce tobacco use in

3048
02:03:18,029 --> 02:03:24,989
the United States the product that kills

3049
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:26,820
more Americans than any other product it

3050
02:03:24,989 --> 02:03:28,920
is the single largest source of

3051
02:03:26,819 --> 02:03:31,409
preventable death and disease in our

3052
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:33,899
country claiming the lives of four

3053
02:03:31,409 --> 02:03:39,689
hundred and eighty thousand Americans

3054
02:03:33,899 --> 02:03:42,989
every year and all this has occurred in

3055
02:03:39,689 --> 02:03:46,559
the face of a regulatory environment

3056
02:03:42,989 --> 02:03:50,340
here in California at least with respect

3057
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:53,910
to tobacco is fairly robust and I will

3058
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:56,760
turn my remarks to that now under

3059
02:03:53,909 --> 02:04:01,139
California law electronic cigarettes are

3060
02:03:56,760 --> 02:04:04,560
considered tobacco products as such they

3061
02:04:01,140 --> 02:04:07,220
are subject as my colleague here Nicolas

3062
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:11,310
Maduro said to state excise taxes and

3063
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:14,810
state licensing laws state smoke-free

3064
02:04:11,310 --> 02:04:17,670
laws state underage sales laws and

3065
02:04:14,810 --> 02:04:19,740
remote saw sales laws and I'm sure I

3066
02:04:17,670 --> 02:04:23,220
haven't given a full list but it there's

3067
02:04:19,739 --> 02:04:25,769
fairly comprehensive regulation of

3068
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:30,470
electronic cigarettes at the state level

3069
02:04:25,770 --> 02:04:34,100
in addition many local communities have

3070
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:36,869
adopted ordinances to regulate

3071
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:40,010
electronic cigarettes in one fashion or

3072
02:04:36,869 --> 02:04:44,489
another mainly this comes in the form of

3073
02:04:40,010 --> 02:04:48,600
local retail tobacco license ordinances

3074
02:04:44,489 --> 02:04:51,210
but in some instances it is legislation

3075
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:54,050
that is specifically directed at

3076
02:04:51,210 --> 02:04:57,899
electronic cigarettes or flavored

3077
02:04:54,050 --> 02:05:02,239
products at least seven counties and

3078
02:04:57,899 --> 02:05:07,619
more than 32 cities in the state

3079
02:05:02,239 --> 02:05:10,219
regulate in this fashion at the federal

3080
02:05:07,619 --> 02:05:14,420
level electronic cigarettes are

3081
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:17,630
regulated but to a lesser degree the

3082
02:05:14,420 --> 02:05:20,310
federal Food and Drug Administration has

3083
02:05:17,630 --> 02:05:22,289
regulatory authority under the federal

3084
02:05:20,310 --> 02:05:25,710
Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco

3085
02:05:22,289 --> 02:05:28,109
Control Act which was passed in 2009 and

3086
02:05:25,710 --> 02:05:30,300
under their deeming regs

3087
02:05:28,109 --> 02:05:34,849
electronic cigarettes are within their

3088
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:38,520
regulatory ambit however the FDA has

3089
02:05:34,850 --> 02:05:42,150
adhered to an enforcement policy which

3090
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:45,840
has allowed electronic cigarettes to be

3091
02:05:42,149 --> 02:05:48,989
sold and marketed in the United States

3092
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:51,560
including in California without going

3093
02:05:48,989 --> 02:05:56,219
through the required pre-market approval

3094
02:05:51,560 --> 02:06:00,470
process by the FDA now I have seen in

3095
02:05:56,220 --> 02:06:03,650
news reports to the fact that the FDA is

3096
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:07,619
reviewing that enforcement policy and

3097
02:06:03,649 --> 02:06:10,170
may change it especially with respect to

3098
02:06:07,619 --> 02:06:11,880
a flavored electronic cigarettes but we

3099
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:15,779
haven't seen anything definitive from

3100
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:17,760
that agency at this point I would note

3101
02:06:15,779 --> 02:06:21,420
that electronic cigarettes are not

3102
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:23,510
subject to federal excise taxes nor are

3103
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:25,949
they subject to a number of other

3104
02:06:23,510 --> 02:06:28,470
federal laws that apply to other tobacco

3105
02:06:25,949 --> 02:06:32,819
products such as the pact Act which

3106
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:36,329
governs intercept interstate internet

3107
02:06:32,819 --> 02:06:39,319
and mail-order sales of cigarettes and

3108
02:06:36,329 --> 02:06:41,729
smokeless tobacco or the total

3109
02:06:39,319 --> 02:06:45,049
contraband cigarette trafficking Act

3110
02:06:41,729 --> 02:06:49,709
which governs smuggling of cigarettes

3111
02:06:45,050 --> 02:06:52,350
with that I want to talk about the

3112
02:06:49,710 --> 02:06:56,520
Attorney General's own role with respect

3113
02:06:52,350 --> 02:07:02,250
to tobacco this role dates back several

3114
02:06:56,520 --> 02:07:05,130
decades now to really the mid 1990s so

3115
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:07,890
in California among a large number of

3116
02:07:05,130 --> 02:07:12,230
other states sued the major cigarette

3117
02:07:07,890 --> 02:07:15,890
manufacturers for a host of wrongdoing

3118
02:07:12,229 --> 02:07:17,729
but most notably their decades-long

3119
02:07:15,890 --> 02:07:21,060
conspiracy to deceive the American

3120
02:07:17,729 --> 02:07:23,479
people about the health risks of the

3121
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:28,770
products and the addictiveness of

3122
02:07:23,479 --> 02:07:33,209
nicotine those lawsuits were resolved by

3123
02:07:28,770 --> 02:07:35,340
the master settlement agreement which at

3124
02:07:33,210 --> 02:07:40,170
the time is the largest civil settlement

3125
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:40,750
in American history it imposes a number

3126
02:07:40,170 --> 02:07:43,149
of

3127
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:46,300
on going obligations on the part of the

3128
02:07:43,149 --> 02:07:48,429
signatory manufacturers particularly in

3129
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:51,730
the areas of advertising and marketing

3130
02:07:48,430 --> 02:07:54,240
but they also obligate the manufacturers

3131
02:07:51,729 --> 02:07:59,259
to make payments to the settling states

3132
02:07:54,239 --> 02:08:01,630
in perpetuity so long as they continue

3133
02:07:59,260 --> 02:08:05,770
to manufacture and sell their products

3134
02:08:01,630 --> 02:08:07,869
in the domestic stream of Commerce the

3135
02:08:05,770 --> 02:08:11,650
California Attorney General's Office has

3136
02:08:07,869 --> 02:08:15,840
had a unit now for 20 years that has

3137
02:08:11,649 --> 02:08:19,539
overseen their compliance with this

3138
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:21,460
really landmark agreement we have not

3139
02:08:19,539 --> 02:08:24,519
hesitated to sue individual

3140
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:26,529
manufacturers when we thought that they

3141
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:29,770
did not comply with their obligations

3142
02:08:26,529 --> 02:08:32,319
under that agreement so we have sued and

3143
02:08:29,770 --> 02:08:35,650
won on issues such as youth targeting

3144
02:08:32,319 --> 02:08:38,949
and we and free sampling we have

3145
02:08:35,649 --> 02:08:42,250
overseen their compliance with payment

3146
02:08:38,949 --> 02:08:45,340
obligations and they are substantial to

3147
02:08:42,250 --> 02:08:48,010
date California has received sixteen

3148
02:08:45,340 --> 02:08:51,750
point five billion dollars in payments

3149
02:08:48,010 --> 02:08:56,050
from the signatory manufacturers and in

3150
02:08:51,750 --> 02:08:58,680
2019 alone California received just shy

3151
02:08:56,050 --> 02:09:03,039
of eight hundred and fifty million

3152
02:08:58,680 --> 02:09:04,630
dollars in addition to making sure that

3153
02:09:03,039 --> 02:09:06,760
the companies that are part of the

3154
02:09:04,630 --> 02:09:08,680
master settlement agreement live up to

3155
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:11,920
their obligations under that agreement

3156
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:14,950
the staff within the California Attorney

3157
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:16,989
General's Office and forces a state law

3158
02:09:14,949 --> 02:09:19,090
called an escrow statute that applies to

3159
02:09:16,989 --> 02:09:21,639
the manufacturers that are not part of

3160
02:09:19,090 --> 02:09:24,100
that settlement agreement there are

3161
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:28,710
certain obligations that they have based

3162
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:31,539
on their sales here in California we are

3163
02:09:28,710 --> 02:09:34,239
thankful we have another state law

3164
02:09:31,539 --> 02:09:37,930
called the tobacco directory statute

3165
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:41,889
that Shores up our ability to enforce

3166
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:44,110
both of those laws that law obligates

3167
02:09:41,890 --> 02:09:47,020
the attorney general's office to create

3168
02:09:44,109 --> 02:09:49,779
and maintain a public list on our

3169
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:51,850
website of all the cigarette

3170
02:09:49,779 --> 02:09:53,920
manufacturers and brain

3171
02:09:51,850 --> 02:09:57,820
that are lawful for sale in the state

3172
02:09:53,920 --> 02:10:00,609
and there is a screening process that my

3173
02:09:57,819 --> 02:10:02,469
staff and I do with respect to every

3174
02:10:00,609 --> 02:10:04,839
single cigarette manufacturer that wants

3175
02:10:02,470 --> 02:10:07,480
to be listed on that directory to make

3176
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:09,880
sure that they have satisfied the

3177
02:10:07,479 --> 02:10:11,859
statutory requirements which include a

3178
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:14,680
showing that they've complied with their

3179
02:10:11,859 --> 02:10:17,609
financial obligations and they're

3180
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:22,539
compliant with other laws such as state

3181
02:10:17,609 --> 02:10:26,619
licensing statutes so we have that as a

3182
02:10:22,539 --> 02:10:29,680
tool I can tell you based on my own

3183
02:10:26,619 --> 02:10:33,430
experience that it is served California

3184
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:37,289
well it is a gatekeeping function that

3185
02:10:33,430 --> 02:10:41,230
has been very valuable in being able to

3186
02:10:37,289 --> 02:10:44,529
assure that the cigarettes that are sold

3187
02:10:41,229 --> 02:10:48,309
in California are lawful for sale in

3188
02:10:44,529 --> 02:10:50,800
California and to make those out there

3189
02:10:48,310 --> 02:10:53,500
in the field easily identified the rogue

3190
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:59,710
brands and rogue manufacturers that

3191
02:10:53,500 --> 02:11:02,050
qualify as contraband now the MSA the

3192
02:10:59,710 --> 02:11:04,060
tobacco directory and the escrow statute

3193
02:11:02,050 --> 02:11:07,360
don't apply to electronic cigarettes

3194
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:10,240
that said that California attorney

3195
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:13,449
general's office has been active with

3196
02:11:10,239 --> 02:11:15,519
respect to electronic cigarettes among

3197
02:11:13,449 --> 02:11:19,420
other things that California attorney

3198
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:22,870
general's office staff have overseen the

3199
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:26,409
compliance of electronic cigarette

3200
02:11:22,869 --> 02:11:28,210
sellers that sell over the Internet to

3201
02:11:26,409 --> 02:11:30,789
make sure that they're compliant with

3202
02:11:28,210 --> 02:11:35,890
California stake Act and other laws that

3203
02:11:30,789 --> 02:11:38,739
apply to them and in 2019 so far this

3204
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:41,980
year alone we have issued 40 more than

3205
02:11:38,739 --> 02:11:45,989
40 warning letters to retailers that are

3206
02:11:41,979 --> 02:11:50,439
selling through the internet that have

3207
02:11:45,989 --> 02:11:57,699
sold to underage customers or otherwise

3208
02:11:50,439 --> 02:12:01,299
not compliant we have also not hesitated

3209
02:11:57,699 --> 02:12:03,220
to sue e cig companies for other forms

3210
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:04,880
of wrongdoing including false

3211
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:07,270
advertising

3212
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:11,779
and youth targeting and we have

3213
02:12:07,270 --> 02:12:13,430
judgments against too we also work

3214
02:12:11,779 --> 02:12:17,029
closely with other state agencies

3215
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:20,510
including CDT FA we share information

3216
02:12:17,029 --> 02:12:24,319
with them about businesses that we have

3217
02:12:20,510 --> 02:12:27,590
reason to think may be operating without

3218
02:12:24,319 --> 02:12:30,079
required state licenses or potentially

3219
02:12:27,590 --> 02:12:34,489
violating their obligations to pay the

3220
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:35,840
state excise taxes that are owed and in

3221
02:12:34,489 --> 02:12:38,210
addition the California Attorney

3222
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:41,380
General's Office are more precisely

3223
02:12:38,210 --> 02:12:47,989
attorney-general Becerra has urged the

3224
02:12:41,380 --> 02:12:51,470
FDA to step up its own enforcement with

3225
02:12:47,989 --> 02:12:54,409
respect to electronic cigarettes to act

3226
02:12:51,470 --> 02:12:59,150
more aggressively in the name of public

3227
02:12:54,409 --> 02:13:01,489
health in earlier this year Attorney

3228
02:12:59,149 --> 02:13:05,599
General visera along with several other

3229
02:13:01,489 --> 02:13:09,109
state attorneys general urged the FDA to

3230
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:13,820
prioritize enforcement of all flavored

3231
02:13:09,109 --> 02:13:16,759
electronic cigarettes so it is Attorney

3232
02:13:13,819 --> 02:13:20,509
General is on record that this is an

3233
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:25,039
important area of enforcement I would

3234
02:13:20,510 --> 02:13:28,340
add the thanks to Prop 56 the California

3235
02:13:25,039 --> 02:13:32,979
Attorney General's Office has new ich

3236
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:39,079
role in supporting local law enforcement

3237
02:13:32,979 --> 02:13:41,179
the Prop 56 as has been noted is among

3238
02:13:39,079 --> 02:13:42,710
other things increases the state excise

3239
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:45,710
tax on cigarettes and other tobacco

3240
02:13:42,710 --> 02:13:48,560
products it you marks the revenue for a

3241
02:13:45,710 --> 02:13:51,230
number of purposes including 30 million

3242
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:53,510
dollars a year that is allocated to the

3243
02:13:51,229 --> 02:13:57,829
Department of Justice for distribution

3244
02:13:53,510 --> 02:14:01,570
to local law enforcement for enforcement

3245
02:13:57,829 --> 02:14:05,180
of state and local laws that deal with

3246
02:14:01,569 --> 02:14:08,889
illegal and underage sales of tobacco so

3247
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:13,789
there's a particular focus on sales and

3248
02:14:08,890 --> 02:14:15,950
use by minors miss let me ask you to

3249
02:14:13,789 --> 02:14:16,488

3250
02:14:15,949 --> 02:14:19,819

thank you for convening this hearing on

3268
02:15:06,229 --> 02:15:08,779
and your leadership on this very

3269
02:15:07,729 --> 02:15:11,899
important issue

3270
02:15:08,779 --> 02:15:15,738
I am going to cut some of my remarks so

3271
02:15:11,899 --> 02:15:17,420
in light of the time again my name is

3272

Attorney General this is one of the

3276
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:24,980
newest sections in the office and I want

3277
02:15:24,078 --> 02:15:27,408
to just give you a little bit of

3278
02:15:24,979 --> 02:15:30,169
background on what this section was

3279
02:15:27,408 --> 02:15:33,948
about to do the section was formed by

3280
02:15:30,170 --> 02:15:35,989
attorney general visera in 2018 we

3281
02:15:33,948 --> 02:15:37,848
represent the licensing agencies the

3282
02:15:35,988 --> 02:15:39,859
Bureau of cannabis control California

3283
02:15:37,849 --> 02:15:42,319
Department of Food and Agriculture

3284
02:15:39,859 --> 02:15:44,538
Department of Public Health in civil and

3285
02:15:42,319 --> 02:15:47,058
administrative matters we also work with

3286
02:15:44,538 --> 02:15:49,189
informs enforcement agencies such as the

3287
02:15:47,059 --> 02:15:51,440
California Highway Patrol the Department

3288
02:15:49,189 --> 02:15:53,479
of Fish and Wildlife State Water and

3289
02:15:51,439 --> 02:15:56,178
represent them in their cannabis

3290
02:15:53,479 --> 02:15:57,709
enforcement activities we also provide

3291
02:15:56,179 --> 02:15:59,630
guidance to a number of state agencies

3292
02:15:57,710 --> 02:16:03,349
including the Department of Consumer

3293
02:15:59,630 --> 02:16:05,179
Affairs the cannabis Enforcement Unit we

3294
02:16:03,349 --> 02:16:07,610
also advise the Attorney General on

3295
02:16:05,179 --> 02:16:09,529
matters impacting legal commercial

3296
02:16:07,609 --> 02:16:12,408
cannabis operations in California

3297
02:16:09,529 --> 02:16:15,259
recently the Attorney General supported

3298
02:16:12,408 --> 02:16:17,629
us actually he continues to support a

3299
02:16:15,260 --> 02:16:20,210
strong regulated market and with this in

3300
02:16:17,630 --> 02:16:22,969
mind AG Becerra recently signed on to

3301
02:16:20,210 --> 02:16:26,510
several letters in support of federal

3302
02:16:22,969 --> 02:16:29,850
legislation namely the safe Banking Act

3303
02:16:26,510 --> 02:16:34,260
and the States Act in addition

3304
02:16:29,850 --> 02:16:37,200
provided support for comment for FDA to

3305
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:41,219
engage in research on CBD and other

3306
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:43,620
cannabis related products you've heard

3307
02:16:41,218 --> 02:16:46,169
all about the regulations so I won't go

3308
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:48,750
into that except to say that California

3309
02:16:46,170 --> 02:16:51,030
does have a comprehensive regulation of

3310
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:55,260
cannabis cannabis products in cannabis

3311
02:16:51,030 --> 02:16:57,120
sales now to reiterate California has

3312
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:59,040
some of the most rigorous standards for

3313
02:16:57,120 --> 02:17:00,840
testing cannabis and cannabis products

3314
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:03,500
that are sold in the regulated

3315
02:17:00,840 --> 02:17:06,899
marketplace in this state unfortunately

3316
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:10,229
we still have a very large unregulated

3317
02:17:06,899 --> 02:17:12,059
and illegal market and they sell they

3318
02:17:10,229 --> 02:17:14,459
continue to solve products in the state

3319
02:17:12,059 --> 02:17:17,819
that are of an unknown origin and have

3320
02:17:14,459 --> 02:17:19,739
not been tested I again will not repeat

3321
02:17:17,819 --> 02:17:23,699
the CDC information that you've heard

3322
02:17:19,739 --> 02:17:25,979
several times except to say that we need

3323
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:28,349
to keep in mind that the CDC has been

3324
02:17:25,979 --> 02:17:29,899
unable to link the outbreak to a single

3325
02:17:28,349 --> 02:17:33,179
product or substance

3326
02:17:29,899 --> 02:17:34,770
however we will acknowledge that most of

3327
02:17:33,179 --> 02:17:38,700
the patients reported a history of using

3328
02:17:34,770 --> 02:17:42,810
THC containing products fewer reported

3329
02:17:38,700 --> 02:17:46,050
nicotine only products but the CDC also

3330
02:17:42,809 --> 02:17:48,869
reports that the patients reported that

3331
02:17:46,049 --> 02:17:51,329
they didn't purchase the C THC products

3332
02:17:48,870 --> 02:17:53,760
from licensed regulated marketplaces

3333
02:17:51,329 --> 02:17:55,819
they obtained them from other sources it

3334
02:17:53,760 --> 02:18:00,239
might have been friends family members

3335
02:17:55,819 --> 02:18:04,289
no one knows where they came from so as

3336
02:18:00,239 --> 02:18:09,599
you all know Proposition 64 resulted in

3337
02:18:04,290 --> 02:18:11,550
the reduction of many offenses as making

3338
02:18:09,599 --> 02:18:14,610
them infractions or misdemeanors

3339
02:18:11,549 --> 02:18:17,638
so when it comes to regulating the

3340
02:18:14,610 --> 02:18:22,200
unlicensed marketplace it's become a

3341
02:18:17,638 --> 02:18:25,348
little difficult for prosecutors and law

3342
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:28,320
enforcement to pursue these cases as you

3343
02:18:25,349 --> 02:18:30,840
also know several sections of the Health

3344
02:18:28,319 --> 02:18:33,270
and Safety Code reduced crimes to

3345
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:35,280
infractions and misdemeanors there

3346
02:18:33,270 --> 02:18:38,370
really aren't too many felonies except

3347
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:40,940
maybe sale to minors if you can attach a

3348
02:18:38,370 --> 02:18:43,369
felony to another offense fraud

3349
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:45,889
environmental impact

3350
02:18:43,369 --> 02:18:50,510
you have more weight to pursue a

3351
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:54,709
prosecution legislature also included in

3352
02:18:50,510 --> 02:18:57,949
my cursor business and profession code

3353
02:18:54,709 --> 02:18:59,868
to 6:03 8 which allows civil penalties

3354
02:18:57,949 --> 02:19:02,300
of up to three times the amount of the

3355
02:18:59,869 --> 02:19:04,729
license fee for each violation of

3356
02:19:02,299 --> 02:19:07,099
unlicensed commercial activity and most

3357
02:19:04,728 --> 02:19:09,888
recently as part of the trailer bill you

3358
02:19:07,099 --> 02:19:11,658
added a Code section business and

3359
02:19:09,888 --> 02:19:15,018
Professions Code section two six zero

3360
02:19:11,658 --> 02:19:16,760
three one point five which also permits

3361
02:19:15,019 --> 02:19:20,539
a licensing authority to issue citations

3362
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:22,130
to licensed or unlicensed operators the

3363
02:19:20,539 --> 02:19:24,260
citation can include an order of

3364
02:19:22,129 --> 02:19:27,528
abatement and/or administrative fines

3365
02:19:24,260 --> 02:19:31,158
not to exceed $5,000 per violation for a

3366
02:19:27,529 --> 02:19:33,920
licensee and $30,000 per violation for

3367
02:19:31,158 --> 02:19:36,049
an unwise person again each day of

3368
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:40,760
violation constitutes a separate

3369
02:19:36,049 --> 02:19:42,670
violation by recent estimates 80% of the

3370
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:46,609
cannabis industry in California remains

3371
02:19:42,670 --> 02:19:50,600
unlicensed and unregulated we are now 22

3372
02:19:46,609 --> 02:19:52,670
months into licensing those businesses

3373
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:55,158
we could argue that intended to come

3374
02:19:52,670 --> 02:19:57,770
into the legal regulated market have

3375
02:19:55,158 --> 02:20:00,288
already done so or are in the process of

3376
02:19:57,770 --> 02:20:02,689
doing so by having obtained provisional

3377
02:20:00,289 --> 02:20:04,729
licenses submitted annual license

3378
02:20:02,689 --> 02:20:06,908
applications and/or submitted

3379
02:20:04,728 --> 02:20:09,889
applications to local jurisdictions

3380
02:20:06,908 --> 02:20:11,689
based on the volume of illegal

3381
02:20:09,889 --> 02:20:14,299
businesses continuing to operate in

3382
02:20:11,689 --> 02:20:16,520
California any meaningful enforcement

3383
02:20:14,299 --> 02:20:21,408
requires sufficient resources and

3384
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:23,779
coordination of efforts in the past

3385
02:20:21,408 --> 02:20:25,430
several weeks we have heard from law

3386
02:20:23,779 --> 02:20:29,029
enforcement offices from throughout the

3387
02:20:25,430 --> 02:20:31,010
state what we've heard is where

3388
02:20:29,029 --> 02:20:33,050
enforcement does take place it is

3389
02:20:31,010 --> 02:20:35,328
questionable as to what impact it is

3390
02:20:33,049 --> 02:20:37,309
having due to the limited ability of

3391
02:20:35,328 --> 02:20:40,309
prosecutors to take meaningful action

3392
02:20:37,309 --> 02:20:44,090
against those in the illegal unregulated

3393
02:20:40,309 --> 02:20:46,609
market place again currently violations

3394
02:20:44,090 --> 02:20:48,609
of the law that are only based on

3395
02:20:46,609 --> 02:20:51,770
cannabis violations are generally

3396
02:20:48,609 --> 02:20:54,289
infractions or misdemeanors for an

3397
02:20:51,770 --> 02:20:56,319
unlegal unregulated business earning

3398
02:20:54,289 --> 02:20:59,529
potentially thousands of

3399
02:20:56,318 --> 02:21:01,180
as mr. medoras also indicated those

3400
02:20:59,529 --> 02:21:03,700
spines may be viewed as the cost of

3401
02:21:01,180 --> 02:21:05,579
doing business and might not have any

3402
02:21:03,700 --> 02:21:08,350
impact on deterring continued

3403
02:21:05,579 --> 02:21:11,738
participation in the illegal unregulated

3404
02:21:08,350 --> 02:21:13,930
marketplace in many instances retail

3405
02:21:11,738 --> 02:21:16,209
pop-up shops are shut down one day and

3406
02:21:13,930 --> 02:21:18,850
reappear the next day several doors away

3407
02:21:16,209 --> 02:21:20,500
in one recent meeting with law

3408
02:21:18,850 --> 02:21:23,640
enforcement representatives this was

3409
02:21:20,500 --> 02:21:23,639
described playing whack-a-mole

3410
02:21:25,079 --> 02:21:31,809
so while providing licensing agencies

3411
02:21:29,318 --> 02:21:35,170
with enforcement tools there remains a

3412
02:21:31,809 --> 02:21:37,148
gap for meaningful enforcement criminal

3413
02:21:35,170 --> 02:21:39,299
again the criminal penalties being

3414
02:21:37,148 --> 02:21:42,039
infractions and misdemeanors for

3415
02:21:39,299 --> 02:21:46,209
unlicensed again I want to focus on

3416
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:49,270
unlicensed only it's not having an

3417
02:21:46,209 --> 02:21:52,089
effect the Attorney General supports

3418
02:21:49,270 --> 02:21:54,909
both a strong regulated cannabis market

3419
02:21:52,090 --> 02:21:57,130
and efforts to ensure the success for

3420
02:21:54,909 --> 02:21:59,318
the legal marketplace in California and

3421
02:21:57,129 --> 02:22:01,329
we welcome the opportunity to further

3422
02:21:59,318 --> 02:22:04,420
discuss how this can be done thank you

3423
02:22:01,329 --> 02:22:05,950
very much thank you very much appreciate

3424
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:09,068
the comments that were given and then

3425
02:22:05,950 --> 02:22:11,920
we'll get into comments and questions

3426
02:22:09,068 --> 02:22:14,139
from members of the joint committee and

3427
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:17,379
just as a reminder to committee members

3428
02:22:14,139 --> 02:22:19,238
that we still have an additional panel

3429
02:22:17,379 --> 02:22:22,688
as well as a public comment so we'll

3430
02:22:19,238 --> 02:22:24,219
first begin with dr. wood thank you very

3431
02:22:22,689 --> 02:22:27,370
much to all of you appreciate appreciate

3432
02:22:24,219 --> 02:22:30,219
the information and I can sense that you

3433
02:22:27,370 --> 02:22:33,700
are all somewhat overwhelmed by the

3434
02:22:30,219 --> 02:22:35,829
enormity of the challenges that we face

3435
02:22:33,700 --> 02:22:37,989
I did hear miss H actually talked you

3436
02:22:35,829 --> 02:22:42,309
said that you were actively working with

3437
02:22:37,988 --> 02:22:44,859
manufacturers and retailers and so on I

3438
02:22:42,309 --> 02:22:47,139
didn't hear deliveries are you enforcing

3439
02:22:44,859 --> 02:22:50,140
against delivery drivers and illicit

3440
02:22:47,139 --> 02:22:53,858
delivery operations as well yeah when we

3441
02:22:50,139 --> 02:22:56,199
talk about retailers we yes there's a

3442
02:22:53,859 --> 02:22:58,000
huge number of unlicensed deliveries and

3443
02:22:56,200 --> 02:22:59,560
that and I do wonder where they're

3444
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,450
getting their products because there's

3445
02:22:59,559 --> 02:23:04,350
no storefront to trace it back to in

3446
02:23:01,450 --> 02:23:04,350
many cases

3447
02:23:04,648 --> 02:23:08,010
with regard to the and I know you can't

3448
02:23:06,629 --> 02:23:09,719
talk about because you punched thing and

3449
02:23:08,010 --> 02:23:13,409
so I'm not going there but it does make

3450
02:23:09,719 --> 02:23:16,500
me wonder how many other operations are

3451
02:23:13,409 --> 02:23:20,100
out there so when you guys are shutting

3452
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:21,750
down illicit operations are you testing

3453
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:25,319
any of the products that come out of

3454
02:23:21,750 --> 02:23:30,540
those stores to see are those products

3455
02:23:25,319 --> 02:23:32,699
in line with current standards I would

3456
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:35,010
guess that they're not and I would I

3457
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:36,990
kind of well I would think like to think

3458
02:23:35,010 --> 02:23:38,250
not I kind of wonder how many more cushy

3459
02:23:36,989 --> 02:23:42,780
punches there are out there quite

3460
02:23:38,250 --> 02:23:46,530
frankly with the value of product that

3461
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:48,960
may not pass testing and needing an

3462
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:51,090
outlet to recoup their the the money

3463
02:23:48,959 --> 02:23:52,799
that goes with that so a little

3464
02:23:51,090 --> 02:23:54,450
frustrating that we don't have much in

3465
02:23:52,799 --> 02:23:58,049
the way of enforcement tools it sounds

3466
02:23:54,450 --> 02:23:59,939
like to other than citations and

3467
02:23:58,049 --> 02:24:03,148
misdemeanors which are hardly even a

3468
02:23:59,939 --> 02:24:04,680
slap on the wrist it feels like so that

3469
02:24:03,148 --> 02:24:07,978
was more of an editorial comment but if

3470
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:12,120
you haven't obviously if you have any

3471
02:24:07,978 --> 02:24:13,799
comment on that so depending on the you

3472
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:16,290
know we get many complaints on

3473
02:24:13,799 --> 02:24:18,090
unlicensed activity and now especially

3474
02:24:16,290 --> 02:24:20,220
with all the media surrounding the the

3475
02:24:18,090 --> 02:24:21,930
vaping crisis we get a lot of complaints

3476
02:24:20,219 --> 02:24:23,789
so we work together with the Department

3477
02:24:21,930 --> 02:24:25,800
of Public Health and if we feel

3478
02:24:23,790 --> 02:24:28,020
something needs to be tested we are

3479
02:24:25,799 --> 02:24:31,739
working in partnership with them to have

3480
02:24:28,020 --> 02:24:35,340
that product tested okay with regards to

3481
02:24:31,739 --> 02:24:39,409
those are mr. Maduro us from CDT FA so

3482
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:42,180
as we talked about the taxation taxation

3483
02:24:39,409 --> 02:24:44,219
those are also sort of a slap on the

3484
02:24:42,180 --> 02:24:46,590
wrist as well I thought I thought people

3485
02:24:44,219 --> 02:24:49,648
in general kind of afraid about the tax

3486
02:24:46,590 --> 02:24:52,170
collectors and informers so I know I am

3487
02:24:49,648 --> 02:24:54,389
I'm very careful about my returns and

3488
02:24:52,170 --> 02:24:56,850
things but I got the impression it feels

3489
02:24:54,389 --> 02:24:58,379
like that maybe some people aren't nice

3490
02:24:56,850 --> 02:25:00,180
in some of these industries I think

3491
02:24:58,379 --> 02:25:02,719
that's right I I too if somebody

3492
02:25:00,180 --> 02:25:06,960
threatened me with a misdemeanor as a

3493
02:25:02,719 --> 02:25:12,989
nerdy middle-aged fellow would be afraid

3494
02:25:06,959 --> 02:25:14,909
but alas those people earning lots of

3495
02:25:12,989 --> 02:25:16,228
money in the illegal cannabis market

3496
02:25:14,909 --> 02:25:17,850
don't seem afraid and that and the tie

3497
02:25:16,228 --> 02:25:20,429
here to the vaping in my

3498
02:25:17,850 --> 02:25:22,350
mind is that you know I would the

3499
02:25:20,430 --> 02:25:25,229
products that are being sold that are

3500
02:25:22,350 --> 02:25:26,760
untaxed are also untested right and

3501
02:25:25,228 --> 02:25:29,938
that's the real I just want to make sure

3502
02:25:26,760 --> 02:25:33,719
I think that's I think that's that's the

3503
02:25:29,939 --> 02:25:36,750
key and I do think in my mind it is both

3504
02:25:33,719 --> 02:25:40,858
the criminal sanctions but to bring a

3505
02:25:36,750 --> 02:25:43,469
criminal case take so long and it's

3506
02:25:40,859 --> 02:25:45,869
really difficult when we're got

3507
02:25:43,469 --> 02:25:47,670
thousands of these in my mind what needs

3508
02:25:45,869 --> 02:25:50,909
to happen is there needs there need to

3509
02:25:47,670 --> 02:25:53,219
be civil penalties or tax penalties that

3510
02:25:50,908 --> 02:25:56,670
are allowed to be put on very quickly

3511
02:25:53,219 --> 02:26:01,858
and if if they're put on in air people

3512
02:25:56,670 --> 02:26:05,010
can appeal but I I just think that even

3513
02:26:01,859 --> 02:26:08,430
going to a felony is not going to

3514
02:26:05,010 --> 02:26:11,520
address the scope of the problem because

3515
02:26:08,430 --> 02:26:14,398
it will take so long to get through the

3516
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:17,158
number of illegal operators that we're

3517
02:26:14,398 --> 02:26:19,639
seeing out there we are trying all sorts

3518
02:26:17,158 --> 02:26:22,139
of ways in the tax realm including

3519
02:26:19,639 --> 02:26:23,760
assessing taxes and telling people you

3520
02:26:22,139 --> 02:26:25,260
know we've you won't give us your

3521
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:26,969
records we've determined that you owe

3522
02:26:25,260 --> 02:26:29,880
the state a million and a half dollars

3523
02:26:26,969 --> 02:26:31,260
and we'll take your house and all of

3524
02:26:29,879 --> 02:26:33,539
your possessions and everything else

3525
02:26:31,260 --> 02:26:36,719
because we are trying to figure out what

3526
02:26:33,540 --> 02:26:39,510
the best way to I mean a they do owe the

3527
02:26:36,719 --> 02:26:41,429
money to the state but we need to figure

3528
02:26:39,510 --> 02:26:44,040
out what the best way to proceed is and

3529
02:26:41,430 --> 02:26:50,189
I'm not sure that what we've always done

3530
02:26:44,040 --> 02:26:52,229
is what will work in this situation so

3531
02:26:50,189 --> 02:26:57,029
sounds like you have a pretty big tool

3532
02:26:52,228 --> 02:26:59,478
belt but not a lot of tools that's one

3533
02:26:57,029 --> 02:26:59,479
way to put it

3534
02:27:03,250 --> 02:27:09,079
thinking a lot along these lines is and

3535
02:27:07,729 --> 02:27:10,879
this is more of a question for the

3536
02:27:09,079 --> 02:27:12,979
attorney general's office because and

3537
02:27:10,879 --> 02:27:14,329
linking this to vaping which is really

3538
02:27:12,979 --> 02:27:16,789
what this is about but this is bringing

3539
02:27:14,329 --> 02:27:18,289
up some other issues that have concern I

3540
02:27:16,790 --> 02:27:20,210
think the Chairman gray and I were

3541
02:27:18,290 --> 02:27:25,360
commenting to get together 22 months

3542
02:27:20,209 --> 02:27:28,699
into this and we have 80% of the market

3543
02:27:25,360 --> 02:27:30,650
unlicensed is pretty appalling and it's

3544
02:27:28,700 --> 02:27:33,950
and I would imagine for those people in

3545
02:27:30,649 --> 02:27:36,890
the licensed market it's pretty it's

3546
02:27:33,950 --> 02:27:38,301
pretty frustrating extremely frustrating

3547
02:27:36,890 --> 02:27:39,890
to know that they're playing by the

3548
02:27:38,300 --> 02:27:41,629
rules and we've got this and I

3549
02:27:39,890 --> 02:27:43,699
understand it and it feels like all of

3550
02:27:41,629 --> 02:27:46,810
you have tool belts and not enough tools

3551
02:27:43,700 --> 02:27:50,030
and none of resources to buy the tools

3552
02:27:46,810 --> 02:27:52,069
and so on so it is a challenge so I want

3553
02:27:50,030 --> 02:27:54,950
to ask a question and and I don't know

3554
02:27:52,069 --> 02:27:57,979
the answer and and so but I am curious

3555
02:27:54,950 --> 02:27:59,480
and I don't know what how this equates

3556
02:27:57,979 --> 02:28:02,449
in the rest of the world so I'm gonna

3557
02:27:59,479 --> 02:28:05,569
ask that same question if we were to

3558
02:28:02,450 --> 02:28:09,311
find that there was an entity or someone

3559
02:28:05,569 --> 02:28:12,590
who was adding something to the vaping

3560
02:28:09,310 --> 02:28:16,659
liquids that was causing this outbreak

3561
02:28:12,590 --> 02:28:21,050
that has caused great bodily harm and

3562
02:28:16,659 --> 02:28:22,690
death in some cases we've decriminalized

3563
02:28:21,050 --> 02:28:25,100
so much around cannabis

3564
02:28:22,690 --> 02:28:27,829
what would the recourse for the AG be

3565
02:28:25,101 --> 02:28:29,210
would there how would you prosecute that

3566
02:28:27,829 --> 02:28:32,450
case or would you be able to prosecute

3567
02:28:29,209 --> 02:28:35,930
it based on with the rule the laws under

3568
02:28:32,450 --> 02:28:40,851
Prop 64 I don't know the answer I'm just

3569
02:28:35,931 --> 02:28:44,450
i but I'm curious the reason I say that

3570
02:28:40,851 --> 02:28:47,391
I would bet that if you were growing

3571
02:28:44,450 --> 02:28:49,601
lettuce or spinach somewhere and you did

3572
02:28:47,390 --> 02:28:53,090
something and you added something there

3573
02:28:49,601 --> 02:28:55,641
and people died across the United States

3574
02:28:53,090 --> 02:28:56,810
you'd be pretty responsible for that and

3575
02:28:55,640 --> 02:29:00,409
a whole number of ways

3576
02:28:56,810 --> 02:29:02,449
so is this industry going to be this

3577
02:29:00,409 --> 02:29:05,119
have the same level of responsibility as

3578
02:29:02,450 --> 02:29:08,870
the lettuce industry or the spinach

3579
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:10,340
industry or Tylenol or anything else out

3580
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:11,700
there but because they've added a

3581
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:15,000
product to something

3582
02:29:11,700 --> 02:29:16,860
cause great bodily harm and death well

3583
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:19,590
as I indicated if you can attach a

3584
02:29:16,860 --> 02:29:21,239
cannabis violation to something else can

3585
02:29:19,590 --> 02:29:23,880
it becomes a felony so I think in the

3586
02:29:21,239 --> 02:29:26,459
case of a death you can attach it to a

3587
02:29:23,879 --> 02:29:29,369
different law that would create a felony

3588
02:29:26,459 --> 02:29:32,399
violation it wouldn't just be a you know

3589
02:29:29,370 --> 02:29:34,200
a manufacturing cannabis violation

3590
02:29:32,399 --> 02:29:36,270
anymore it would be something more than

3591
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:38,940
that so there would be recourse if

3592
02:29:36,271 --> 02:29:40,771
somebody is some if some entities or

3593
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:42,659
whatever we're found to be adding

3594
02:29:40,771 --> 02:29:44,730
something that caused this

3595
02:29:42,659 --> 02:29:47,069
whether knowingly or unknowingly I mean

3596
02:29:44,729 --> 02:29:48,329
creating a public health hazard well I

3597
02:29:47,069 --> 02:29:50,601
think you would differentiate between

3598
02:29:48,329 --> 02:29:52,409
knowingly or Anna unknowingly as

3599
02:29:50,601 --> 02:29:54,391
obviously they know they're adding it

3600
02:29:52,409 --> 02:29:56,780
but I don't know the consequences so

3601
02:29:54,390 --> 02:29:59,670
yeah other would be consequences

3602
02:29:56,780 --> 02:30:02,880
absolutely okay just like there would be

3603
02:29:59,670 --> 02:30:06,601
for lettuce growers well or or you know

3604
02:30:02,879 --> 02:30:09,089
a cultivator who uses deadly pesticides

3605
02:30:06,601 --> 02:30:12,150
and cultivation you can attach it to

3606
02:30:09,090 --> 02:30:14,280
environmental harm or some other felony

3607
02:30:12,149 --> 02:30:16,500
crime and pursue it that way

3608
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:18,690
art art is the are there cases being

3609
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:20,969
pursued where with cultivators who are

3610
02:30:18,690 --> 02:30:23,399
using banned pesticides and that have

3611
02:30:20,969 --> 02:30:24,930
been caught because now you've linked

3612
02:30:23,399 --> 02:30:28,229
those things are those other cases

3613
02:30:24,931 --> 02:30:32,390
actually being being prosecuted now or

3614
02:30:28,229 --> 02:30:34,890
or charged or or are those misdemeanors

3615
02:30:32,390 --> 02:30:37,350
well my office is renewing several cases

3616
02:30:34,890 --> 02:30:41,010
I really can't comment on what we will

3617
02:30:37,351 --> 02:30:44,069
end up charging but we are as I said we

3618
02:30:41,010 --> 02:30:46,649
do work in conjunction with state water

3619
02:30:44,069 --> 02:30:48,390
and Department of Fish and Wildlife and

3620
02:30:46,649 --> 02:30:50,159
because those are environmental those

3621
02:30:48,390 --> 02:30:53,219
are different laws and people have to

3622
02:30:50,159 --> 02:30:55,579
correct they have water codes you can

3623
02:30:53,219 --> 02:30:55,579
attach

3624
02:30:57,170 --> 02:31:07,440
okay all right Thank You mr. great Thank

3625
02:31:03,629 --> 02:31:09,029
You chairman lo I'm gonna do my best to

3626
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:10,471
condense some of these questions and I

3627
02:31:09,030 --> 02:31:12,450
may provide some questions to the panel

3628
02:31:10,470 --> 02:31:14,279
in writing post committee because

3629
02:31:12,450 --> 02:31:16,740
there's a lot I want to get into and I

3630
02:31:14,280 --> 02:31:19,681
know in the interest of time I'll try

3631
02:31:16,739 --> 02:31:21,181
get to the the key points as I see them

3632
02:31:19,681 --> 02:31:25,200
I'm going to start over here with the

3633
02:31:21,181 --> 02:31:28,021
part of the public health during our

3634
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:30,061
process of constructing a B 1639 which

3635
02:31:28,021 --> 02:31:31,650
is legislation myself and several my

3636
02:31:30,060 --> 02:31:34,739
colleagues and certainly members of

3637
02:31:31,649 --> 02:31:36,560
committee worked on we brought in the

3638
02:31:34,739 --> 02:31:39,420
partner public health and we brought in

3639
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:40,949
ABC and talked about what sting

3640
02:31:39,420 --> 02:31:45,060
operations and enforcement activities

3641
02:31:40,950 --> 02:31:49,230
were occurring when the ABC came in it

3642
02:31:45,060 --> 02:31:51,209
was 35 40 45 thousand sting operations

3643
02:31:49,229 --> 02:31:56,000
they're actively actively involved in

3644
02:31:51,209 --> 02:31:58,979
when DPH came in they said we don't know

3645
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:00,569
and they told me all were issuing grants

3646
02:31:58,979 --> 02:32:02,279
to look law enforcement asked how much

3647
02:32:00,569 --> 02:32:04,829
money it was it didn't seem significant

3648
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:06,840
my impression that I'm left with the

3649
02:32:04,829 --> 02:32:08,720
Department of Health is not doing much

3650
02:32:06,840 --> 02:32:10,799
for enforcement in the area tobacco

3651
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:11,850
throughout the state and the frankly the

3652
02:32:10,799 --> 02:32:13,829
grants were given to local law

3653
02:32:11,851 --> 02:32:16,040
enforcement aren't very enticing for

3654
02:32:13,829 --> 02:32:21,379
local law enforcement to get involved in

3655
02:32:16,040 --> 02:32:21,380
what's your response to my impression oh

3656
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:28,440
we have about 4,000 visits to retailers

3657
02:32:27,450 --> 02:32:32,311
every year

3658
02:32:28,440 --> 02:32:34,950
of those in 2018 we had 340 first-time

3659
02:32:32,310 --> 02:32:37,860
violations which ended up in suspension

3660
02:32:34,950 --> 02:32:41,400
of license as 10 second time violators

3661
02:32:37,860 --> 02:32:44,069
and one third time violator at the local

3662
02:32:41,399 --> 02:32:45,959
level we really do more of the training

3663
02:32:44,069 --> 02:32:47,699
of law enforcement of how what they

3664
02:32:45,959 --> 02:32:50,609
would do I don't have information about

3665
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:53,400
what specifically the number of local

3666
02:32:50,610 --> 02:32:56,069
law enforcement visits but I can try and

3667
02:32:53,399 --> 02:32:58,049
get that for you well certainly I think

3668
02:32:56,069 --> 02:32:59,789
we need if you don't need to find out

3669
02:32:58,049 --> 02:33:01,319
and we need to give you the tools either

3670
02:32:59,790 --> 02:33:02,069
to find and to conduct more sting

3671
02:33:01,319 --> 02:33:04,529
operations

3672
02:33:02,068 --> 02:33:05,998
it's again we don't need to reinvent the

3673
02:33:04,529 --> 02:33:07,588
wheel we know that what we do in the

3674
02:33:05,998 --> 02:33:10,020
area of alcohols been fairly effective

3675
02:33:07,588 --> 02:33:11,850
law enforcement knows how to do this I

3676
02:33:10,020 --> 02:33:13,289
think part of the problem is that we

3677
02:33:11,850 --> 02:33:16,369
have the enforcement any non law

3678
02:33:13,289 --> 02:33:18,629
enforcement agency but nonetheless I

3679
02:33:16,369 --> 02:33:19,828
think we make some improvement there but

3680
02:33:18,629 --> 02:33:21,510
it'll be happy to work with you and I'd

3681
02:33:19,828 --> 02:33:24,799
like some feedback when I provide the

3682
02:33:21,510 --> 02:33:28,828
legislation and approaches we're taking

3683
02:33:24,799 --> 02:33:34,009
secondly actually I think you may have

3684
02:33:28,828 --> 02:33:37,288
answered that how many licenses were

3685
02:33:34,010 --> 02:33:38,760
removed there were no licenses removed

3686
02:33:37,289 --> 02:33:40,470
there was one that could have been

3687
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:43,078
removed except that the business shut

3688
02:33:40,469 --> 02:33:46,228
down so there's no license removed right

3689
02:33:43,078 --> 02:33:48,328
okay from the state level I don't know

3690
02:33:46,228 --> 02:33:50,519
about that the local level I understood

3691
02:33:48,328 --> 02:33:57,449
I'm gonna move on now to Bureau of

3692
02:33:50,520 --> 02:34:01,050
cannabis control I want to begin with

3693
02:33:57,449 --> 02:34:04,760
the flavor issue I recently visited a

3694
02:34:01,049 --> 02:34:09,799
dispensary to take a look at a

3695
02:34:04,760 --> 02:34:11,998
dispensary from a flavor viewpoint and

3696
02:34:09,799 --> 02:34:13,559
I'm gonna go ahead and read you some of

3697
02:34:11,998 --> 02:34:17,189
the flavors that were displaying on the

3698
02:34:13,559 --> 02:34:21,180
board of marijuana banana split

3699
02:34:17,189 --> 02:34:25,488
blueberry milkshake wedding cake ice

3700
02:34:21,180 --> 02:34:30,209
cream cake key lime pie purple punch

3701
02:34:25,488 --> 02:34:33,568
peanut butter breath so I'm curious as

3702
02:34:30,209 --> 02:34:35,159
to your perspective given that flavors

3703
02:34:33,568 --> 02:34:39,288
are a major concern for some of my

3704
02:34:35,158 --> 02:34:41,788
colleagues as it relates to e-cigarettes

3705
02:34:39,289 --> 02:34:44,069
what's the perspective on these flavors

3706
02:34:41,789 --> 02:34:46,439
if each cigarette flavors are driving

3707
02:34:44,068 --> 02:34:48,930
teenage consumption and an underage

3708
02:34:46,439 --> 02:34:50,789
consumption that I would assume that is

3709
02:34:48,930 --> 02:34:57,300
true with marijuana but are there no

3710
02:34:50,789 --> 02:34:59,939
restrictions so a lot of those could be

3711
02:34:57,299 --> 02:35:02,668
also strained names that they use it's

3712
02:34:59,939 --> 02:35:03,600
not always necessarily flavors they do

3713
02:35:02,668 --> 02:35:07,529
have

3714
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:09,510
cannabis terpenes but most of the time

3715
02:35:07,529 --> 02:35:12,569
what we see those are strain names and

3716
02:35:09,510 --> 02:35:15,050
so we do look at especially from the

3717
02:35:12,568 --> 02:35:17,109
Department of Public Health side

3718
02:35:15,049 --> 02:35:19,879
you know any packaging can't be

3719
02:35:17,109 --> 02:35:23,210
attractive to children they can't

3720
02:35:19,879 --> 02:35:25,759
advertise to children but for most of

3721
02:35:23,209 --> 02:35:26,809
these those would be cannabis flour

3722
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:31,068
we're talking about

3723
02:35:26,809 --> 02:35:32,778
and so restrictions on packaging again

3724
02:35:31,068 --> 02:35:37,189
would be still it can't be attractive to

3725
02:35:32,779 --> 02:35:39,619
children now what whether or not those

3726
02:35:37,189 --> 02:35:41,029
names represent a flavor or a strain I

3727
02:35:39,619 --> 02:35:43,279
think as far as we're talking about

3728
02:35:41,029 --> 02:35:45,800
marketing the name of a product is in

3729
02:35:43,279 --> 02:35:47,359
fact marketing and those certainly at

3730
02:35:45,799 --> 02:35:50,289
least strike me at first blush and I'm

3731
02:35:47,359 --> 02:35:53,350
going to try to learn more about this as

3732
02:35:50,290 --> 02:35:55,579
directed towards young people or perhaps

3733
02:35:53,350 --> 02:35:57,559
perhaps not maybe the flavors aren't the

3734
02:35:55,578 --> 02:36:01,029
key issue I'm certainly open to that

3735
02:35:57,559 --> 02:36:05,260
we've been debating that all year long

3736
02:36:01,029 --> 02:36:09,670
how many cannabis licenses have been

3737
02:36:05,260 --> 02:36:12,770
suspended or removed this past 22 months

3738
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:17,988
so most of our licenses at the bureau

3739
02:36:12,770 --> 02:36:20,630
are provisional licenses so we issue we

3740
02:36:17,988 --> 02:36:22,818
issue a variety of disciplinary we can

3741
02:36:20,629 --> 02:36:25,129
given if we go into a retail inspection

3742
02:36:22,818 --> 02:36:27,680
and we find violations we can issue a

3743
02:36:25,129 --> 02:36:31,578
notice of comply we can also suspend or

3744
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:34,189
we can also revoke we we've we've done

3745
02:36:31,578 --> 02:36:36,619
some suspensions like for example for

3746
02:36:34,189 --> 02:36:40,040
sales to minor that we had with delivery

3747
02:36:36,619 --> 02:36:42,920
of a licensed retailer most of the time

3748
02:36:40,040 --> 02:36:44,989
we are trying to get our retailers or

3749
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:47,148
any of our licensees to comply with our

3750
02:36:44,988 --> 02:36:49,430
regulations if there's there's a public

3751
02:36:47,148 --> 02:36:52,670
safety issue then we will revoke the

3752
02:36:49,430 --> 02:36:56,420
license or in some cases the licensee

3753
02:36:52,670 --> 02:36:58,340
will cancel their license or whatnot so

3754
02:36:56,420 --> 02:37:00,290
we've had several of those I don't have

3755
02:36:58,340 --> 02:37:02,960
the exact numbers but I can certainly

3756
02:37:00,290 --> 02:37:05,359
provide those to you thank you and how

3757
02:37:02,959 --> 02:37:08,339
many sting operations have been

3758
02:37:05,359 --> 02:37:12,000
conducted on underage purchases

3759
02:37:08,340 --> 02:37:13,949
so that's handled by the sworn law

3760
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:15,809
enforcement part of the bureau under the

3761
02:37:13,949 --> 02:37:17,369
cannabis enforcement unit at the

3762
02:37:15,809 --> 02:37:19,948
Department of Consumer Affairs and I

3763
02:37:17,369 --> 02:37:23,399
could certainly get those for you too as

3764
02:37:19,949 --> 02:37:26,430
well okay well wait for those answers

3765
02:37:23,398 --> 02:37:29,549
and we'll have some follow-up Department

3766
02:37:26,430 --> 02:37:34,590
tax and fee Administration I had the

3767
02:37:29,549 --> 02:37:36,448
opportunity as a young staff legislative

3768
02:37:34,590 --> 02:37:39,889
staffer in this building to work on the

3769
02:37:36,449 --> 02:37:42,180
tax stamp program working with

3770
02:37:39,889 --> 02:37:45,599
then-governor organization cher Jerome

3771
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:46,828
Horton and my understanding hadn't

3772
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:49,199
followed that program over the years is

3773
02:37:46,828 --> 02:37:51,359
that it's been pretty effective in

3774
02:37:49,199 --> 02:37:53,489
addressing black market sales of tobacco

3775
02:37:51,359 --> 02:37:56,210
products and I want to get your take on

3776
02:37:53,488 --> 02:37:58,648
it I think it has been effective in in

3777
02:37:56,209 --> 02:38:01,438
cigarettes which is all it applies to in

3778
02:37:58,648 --> 02:38:02,459
addressing black market sales that's and

3779
02:38:01,439 --> 02:38:06,449
that kind of takes me to my next

3780
02:38:02,459 --> 02:38:07,799
question which is in a in our bill that

3781
02:38:06,449 --> 02:38:10,619
we've been working on we've been trying

3782
02:38:07,799 --> 02:38:13,528
to move in the direction of a tax stamp

3783
02:38:10,619 --> 02:38:15,779
program for vaping products or

3784
02:38:13,529 --> 02:38:17,399
e-cigarette products knowing that it was

3785
02:38:15,779 --> 02:38:19,380
effective in dealing with the black

3786
02:38:17,398 --> 02:38:21,238
market risk was back up one would assume

3787
02:38:19,379 --> 02:38:23,728
we could accomplish the same thing with

3788
02:38:21,238 --> 02:38:27,000
these cigarettes do you see what hurdles

3789
02:38:23,728 --> 02:38:29,010
challenges tools are needed in order to

3790
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:31,619
accomplish that well I don't think we

3791
02:38:29,010 --> 02:38:34,469
could just sort of lift and shift the

3792
02:38:31,619 --> 02:38:38,930
same tax stamping regimen that we have

3793
02:38:34,469 --> 02:38:41,368
there into vaping for a few reasons one

3794
02:38:38,930 --> 02:38:44,220
cigarettes are all taxed to two dollars

3795
02:38:41,369 --> 02:38:47,939
and 87 cents per pack the tax on other

3796
02:38:44,219 --> 02:38:50,099
tobacco products is based on this

3797
02:38:47,939 --> 02:38:52,380
wholesale cost calculation so it's not

3798
02:38:50,100 --> 02:38:54,658
you couldn't sell just a single value

3799
02:38:52,379 --> 02:38:56,938
stamp and say that that's your stamp for

3800
02:38:54,658 --> 02:39:00,799
every product if you wanted to be an

3801
02:38:56,939 --> 02:39:03,869
actual tax stamp the other issue is that

3802
02:39:00,799 --> 02:39:07,618
the packaging on these other products

3803
02:39:03,869 --> 02:39:10,319
the size the number of items contained

3804
02:39:07,619 --> 02:39:12,060
is also not the same with cigarettes

3805
02:39:10,318 --> 02:39:15,180
every single pack is twenty cigarettes

3806
02:39:12,059 --> 02:39:17,969
and there are machines that are

3807
02:39:15,180 --> 02:39:20,068
developed that open the boxes and stamp

3808
02:39:17,969 --> 02:39:22,159
everything and it becomes very efficient

3809
02:39:20,068 --> 02:39:27,689
that said

3810
02:39:22,159 --> 02:39:31,530
the in my mind one of the major things

3811
02:39:27,690 --> 02:39:33,390
that could be addressed here is tracing

3812
02:39:31,530 --> 02:39:36,120
where the product came from and ensuring

3813
02:39:33,390 --> 02:39:39,539
that it's tax paid and ensuring that

3814
02:39:36,120 --> 02:39:42,540
it's not a counterfeit product and those

3815
02:39:39,540 --> 02:39:44,761
could be achieved with with a stamp that

3816
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:49,830
is required that is not necessarily a

3817
02:39:44,761 --> 02:39:51,860
stamp that the distributor buys from us

3818
02:39:49,829 --> 02:39:54,209
for a certain tax amount although that's

3819
02:39:51,860 --> 02:39:56,159
possible but you would have to have

3820
02:39:54,209 --> 02:39:58,770
varying values so it is a little bit

3821
02:39:56,159 --> 02:40:00,181
more complicated but I do think and this

3822
02:39:58,771 --> 02:40:01,891
is one of the things that the governor's

3823
02:40:00,181 --> 02:40:04,471
asked us to look at that we'll be

3824
02:40:01,890 --> 02:40:06,630
reporting out to him later this month on

3825
02:40:04,470 --> 02:40:08,430
that that it's possible to design a

3826
02:40:06,630 --> 02:40:11,310
system that would accomplish that I will

3827
02:40:08,431 --> 02:40:13,921
also say that I believe that initial

3828
02:40:11,310 --> 02:40:16,319
getting the cigarette tax step up and

3829
02:40:13,921 --> 02:40:18,421
running took I think three years which

3830
02:40:16,319 --> 02:40:20,250
is a long time I'd also like to come up

3831
02:40:18,421 --> 02:40:22,829
with something that we could do more

3832
02:40:20,250 --> 02:40:25,261
quickly those are the same issues we

3833
02:40:22,829 --> 02:40:27,870
were struggling with and maybe 1639 was

3834
02:40:25,261 --> 02:40:30,780
trying to figure out how to fast-track

3835
02:40:27,870 --> 02:40:34,620
the tax stamp program as it relates

3836
02:40:30,780 --> 02:40:36,841
although funny enough the the issue that

3837
02:40:34,620 --> 02:40:39,091
stalled our legislation in the state

3838
02:40:36,841 --> 02:40:42,569
Senate this year was in fact the issue

3839
02:40:39,091 --> 02:40:47,310
you raised on equivalency and I bluest

3840
02:40:42,569 --> 02:40:50,039
language in early August that attempted

3841
02:40:47,310 --> 02:40:51,899
to create a more equivalent tax between

3842
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:55,021
traditional tobacco sticks that we were

3843
02:40:51,899 --> 02:40:57,539
going to put into a B 1639 when the

3844
02:40:55,021 --> 02:40:59,101
Senate found out about that the Senate

3845
02:40:57,540 --> 02:41:01,200
Rules Committee refused to grant us a

3846
02:40:59,101 --> 02:41:03,511
hearing on the legislation as they

3847
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:06,320
didn't want to address a attacks at this

3848
02:41:03,511 --> 02:41:09,120
time but we're gonna be coming back

3849
02:41:06,319 --> 02:41:11,431
first thing in the year to still work on

3850
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:13,561
that issue and I'm gonna provide you the

3851
02:41:11,431 --> 02:41:17,579
language that we have to get your

3852
02:41:13,560 --> 02:41:20,931
feedback I'd also like some additional

3853
02:41:17,579 --> 02:41:22,979
feedback on the issues you raised about

3854
02:41:20,931 --> 02:41:25,079
non-compliance with taxes and how we

3855
02:41:22,979 --> 02:41:27,270
might assist in amping up the penalties

3856
02:41:25,079 --> 02:41:28,671
I know chairman would raise that and I

3857
02:41:27,271 --> 02:41:31,939
think that's something we'd all like to

3858
02:41:28,671 --> 02:41:34,520
have some potential solutions on

3859
02:41:31,939 --> 02:41:36,979
you know that certainly can be a very

3860
02:41:34,520 --> 02:41:40,488
effective method of addressing black

3861
02:41:36,978 --> 02:41:43,010
market activities we'd be happy to

3862
02:41:40,488 --> 02:41:44,270
provide you any assistance we can and

3863
02:41:43,010 --> 02:41:46,130
you'll take a look at the equivalency

3864
02:41:44,270 --> 02:41:52,090
tax that I proposed in August and see if

3865
02:41:46,129 --> 02:41:52,089
see if that meets the mark yes okay

3866
02:41:52,389 --> 02:41:59,568
Department of Justice I think that

3867
02:41:57,439 --> 02:42:01,430
concerns me the most I've got about six

3868
02:41:59,568 --> 02:42:04,579
questions here but the thing that you

3869
02:42:01,430 --> 02:42:06,020
raised on the inconsistencies you know

3870
02:42:04,579 --> 02:42:08,840
in the way we're treating as different

3871
02:42:06,020 --> 02:42:11,090
products and the and the penalties and

3872
02:42:08,840 --> 02:42:13,960
tools available to you to enforce right

3873
02:42:11,090 --> 02:42:16,939
and and how that was as I understood it

3874
02:42:13,959 --> 02:42:18,799
made further difficult by some of the

3875
02:42:16,939 --> 02:42:20,979
criminal justice reforms that this body

3876
02:42:18,799 --> 02:42:25,099
in this state have enacted in the past

3877
02:42:20,978 --> 02:42:33,379
you know decade is that an accurate

3878
02:42:25,100 --> 02:42:36,710
depiction of what you said yes excellent

3879
02:42:33,379 --> 02:42:38,599
so I'd like to see some recommendations

3880
02:42:36,709 --> 02:42:41,358
from the DOJ and from our Attorney

3881
02:42:38,600 --> 02:42:43,640
General on what steps the legislature

3882
02:42:41,359 --> 02:42:45,380
can take to give you those tools so as

3883
02:42:43,639 --> 02:42:46,488
to have proper enforcement I think many

3884
02:42:45,379 --> 02:42:48,849
of my colleagues will be interested in

3885
02:42:46,488 --> 02:42:48,850
that as well

3886
02:42:51,579 --> 02:42:57,590
with that I will do my follow-up with

3887
02:42:55,939 --> 02:43:00,020
all of you and provide you the draft

3888
02:42:57,590 --> 02:43:02,988
language that we have prepared that's

3889
02:43:00,020 --> 02:43:06,590
going to be a consistent approach to

3890
02:43:02,988 --> 02:43:08,389
vaping tobacco and marijuana as well as

3891
02:43:06,590 --> 02:43:10,880
enforcement you know I think I think we

3892
02:43:08,389 --> 02:43:12,709
have the know-how you may not all have

3893
02:43:10,879 --> 02:43:14,179
all the tools you need but we need to

3894
02:43:12,709 --> 02:43:16,219
know what those tools that are missing

3895
02:43:14,180 --> 02:43:19,309
or and then we need to get a consistent

3896
02:43:16,219 --> 02:43:21,198
approach to all of these products

3897
02:43:19,309 --> 02:43:25,068
because what we're doing now is you know

3898
02:43:21,199 --> 02:43:28,220
there's certain legislators in this

3899
02:43:25,068 --> 02:43:30,528
building who are you know with one hand

3900
02:43:28,219 --> 02:43:32,539
banning flavored tobacco and with

3901
02:43:30,529 --> 02:43:36,140
another hand encouraging us to smoke

3902
02:43:32,540 --> 02:43:37,520
marijuana and moving vehicles we need to

3903
02:43:36,139 --> 02:43:39,590
get a more consistent policy here

3904
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:41,420
there's some real intellectual

3905
02:43:39,590 --> 02:43:41,899
dishonesty with what we're doing in this

3906
02:43:41,420 --> 02:43:43,549
area

3907
02:43:41,899 --> 02:43:44,869
and I think we need your assistance and

3908
02:43:43,549 --> 02:43:46,909
I think a lot of issues have been raised

3909
02:43:44,870 --> 02:43:49,311
here today that don't make a lot of

3910
02:43:46,909 --> 02:43:51,021
sense and we need to get on the same

3911
02:43:49,310 --> 02:43:53,029
page so thank you for your testimony

3912
02:43:51,021 --> 02:43:55,340
I'll turn it back to chairman love thank

3913
02:43:53,030 --> 02:43:57,530
you very much it's great next up mr.

3914
02:43:55,340 --> 02:43:58,909
McCarthy followed by mr. Cooper I think

3915
02:43:57,530 --> 02:44:01,250
in the interest of time I'd prefer

3916
02:43:58,909 --> 02:44:03,590
getting to the next panel Public Health

3917
02:44:01,250 --> 02:44:05,750
Officer oh great thank you very much mr.

3918
02:44:03,590 --> 02:44:07,521
Cooper I view mr. gray this body's

3919
02:44:05,750 --> 02:44:09,500
consistent at being inconsistent

3920
02:44:07,521 --> 02:44:11,150
really the penalties mean nothing so

3921
02:44:09,500 --> 02:44:13,459
we're talking about the misdemeanor

3922
02:44:11,149 --> 02:44:15,079
$5,000 fine that's the same as someone

3923
02:44:13,459 --> 02:44:17,239
breaking window someone's window or

3924
02:44:15,079 --> 02:44:19,250
doing a lawn job it's a misdemeanor no

3925
02:44:17,239 --> 02:44:21,049
one's going to jail the County Jail to

3926
02:44:19,250 --> 02:44:23,209
spend any time for misdemeanor and by

3927
02:44:21,049 --> 02:44:25,459
time is plea bargain in court it final

3928
02:44:23,209 --> 02:44:29,000
be $1,000 or $500 that's a real that's a

3929
02:44:25,459 --> 02:44:30,199
real reality so why not do it I mean you

3930
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,790
have a lot of good businesses that are

3931
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:34,280
following the law and that are

3932
02:44:31,790 --> 02:44:35,780
productive businesses we have that ban

3933
02:44:34,280 --> 02:44:38,780
element to we've got to deal with and

3934
02:44:35,780 --> 02:44:40,220
just like cushy punch they had one foot

3935
02:44:38,780 --> 02:44:40,940
in there legal and one foot in the black

3936
02:44:40,219 --> 02:44:42,379
market

3937
02:44:40,940 --> 02:44:44,690
and we try to deal with that all the

3938
02:44:42,379 --> 02:44:47,929
time we know that 60% of marijuana in

3939
02:44:44,690 --> 02:44:50,120
California goes out of state grow houses

3940
02:44:47,930 --> 02:44:52,130
Sacramento's grow house central in the

3941
02:44:50,120 --> 02:44:53,780
entire country so what's what's

3942
02:44:52,129 --> 02:44:55,219
frustrating for law enforcement they'll

3943
02:44:53,780 --> 02:44:57,710
do a power search warrant because of

3944
02:44:55,219 --> 02:44:59,719
power usage hit the house deal with

3945
02:44:57,709 --> 02:45:01,250
electricity where it's Muhtar PG&amp;E will

3946
02:44:59,719 --> 02:45:03,619
and they'll leave the marijuana in the

3947
02:45:01,250 --> 02:45:04,549
house so he's leaving thousands and

3948
02:45:03,620 --> 02:45:06,470
thousands of plants that are out there

3949
02:45:04,549 --> 02:45:08,899
and those plants make it back into the

3950
02:45:06,469 --> 02:45:11,149
black market so so how do we change that

3951
02:45:08,899 --> 02:45:13,369
I had a bill in 17 that would have

3952
02:45:11,149 --> 02:45:14,959
addressed this it did with civil funding

3953
02:45:13,370 --> 02:45:16,579
for the state agencies and help the

3954
02:45:14,959 --> 02:45:19,489
cities develop legitimate cannabis

3955
02:45:16,579 --> 02:45:21,351
businesses that bill was gonna die in

3956
02:45:19,489 --> 02:45:22,760
public safety because you can't get any

3957
02:45:21,351 --> 02:45:24,170
of these bills that IV public safety

3958
02:45:22,760 --> 02:45:27,079
neither house that's really what it

3959
02:45:24,170 --> 02:45:28,969
comes down to and it's crazy some of the

3960
02:45:27,079 --> 02:45:30,889
things that go on with this it's a big

3961
02:45:28,969 --> 02:45:31,760
issue so we shouldn't sell the baby out

3962
02:45:30,889 --> 02:45:34,670
with the bathwater

3963
02:45:31,760 --> 02:45:37,159
but how do we do it these folks that are

3964
02:45:34,670 --> 02:45:39,049
the black market you find them and

3965
02:45:37,159 --> 02:45:40,430
punish them because it last

3966
02:45:39,049 --> 02:45:42,170
administration said hey we're not

3967
02:45:40,430 --> 02:45:44,771
signing any law that puts anybody in

3968
02:45:42,170 --> 02:45:47,629
jail or prison we've got a new governor

3969
02:45:44,771 --> 02:45:48,950
I'm excited about him and I want to

3970
02:45:47,629 --> 02:45:50,899
thank him for like his team to come out

3971
02:45:48,950 --> 02:45:52,550
here and work with law enforcement to

3972
02:45:50,899 --> 02:45:54,229
try and figure out how they can solve

3973
02:45:52,549 --> 02:45:56,290
this problem and how to attack it so

3974
02:45:54,229 --> 02:45:58,430
he's he's been collaborative and

3975
02:45:56,290 --> 02:46:01,430
hopefully we'll see more big things from

3976
02:45:58,431 --> 02:46:03,471
the governor warning letters and

3977
02:46:01,431 --> 02:46:05,301
citations they don't care you're making

3978
02:46:03,470 --> 02:46:06,710
so much money I'm tucking the

3979
02:46:05,300 --> 02:46:09,199
black-market not illegal marking a black

3980
02:46:06,710 --> 02:46:12,079
market in the business to make money by

3981
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:13,730
selling product and the more you make

3982
02:46:12,079 --> 02:46:15,200
the more you go so it's worth it for the

3983
02:46:13,729 --> 02:46:16,040
penalties there's nothing it's like no

3984
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:17,811
harm no foul

3985
02:46:16,040 --> 02:46:19,609
why not keep going you're making tens of

3986
02:46:17,810 --> 02:46:20,329
thousand dollars every day why would you

3987
02:46:19,610 --> 02:46:22,579
stop that

3988
02:46:20,329 --> 02:46:24,620
but in this legislature right now

3989
02:46:22,579 --> 02:46:26,060
there's no penalties for anything they

3990
02:46:24,620 --> 02:46:28,671
don't want to ask that forfeiture and

3991
02:46:26,060 --> 02:46:30,739
some of these guys are making big big

3992
02:46:28,671 --> 02:46:32,030
money and you have to use asset

3993
02:46:30,739 --> 02:46:34,251
forfeiture less that you doesn't want to

3994
02:46:32,030 --> 02:46:35,211
do that so how do we change that how do

3995
02:46:34,251 --> 02:46:37,431
we get it done

3996
02:46:35,210 --> 02:46:38,359
hopefully the AG will come out and help

3997
02:46:37,431 --> 02:46:43,131
with some of that but I do have a

3998
02:46:38,360 --> 02:46:45,011
question for mister Medeiros on the let

3999
02:46:43,130 --> 02:46:48,251
me see I'll tell you what the issue is

4000
02:46:45,011 --> 02:46:48,251
excuse me

4001
02:46:48,550 --> 02:46:58,489
as far as the open vape system that goes

4002
02:46:51,771 --> 02:47:04,239
untaxed how do we change that well for

4003
02:46:58,489 --> 02:47:06,921
the non tobacco element of the vape I

4004
02:47:04,239 --> 02:47:10,489
one could change the definition of

4005
02:47:06,921 --> 02:47:13,931
tobacco products to include that those

4006
02:47:10,489 --> 02:47:19,931
other liquids or if you went to nicotine

4007
02:47:13,931 --> 02:47:24,620
based tax then whatever the nicotine can

4008
02:47:19,931 --> 02:47:28,909
portion is would be taxed it presumably

4009
02:47:24,620 --> 02:47:30,021
a fairly robust rate and so if you mixed

4010
02:47:28,909 --> 02:47:31,671
it it wouldn't make any difference

4011
02:47:30,021 --> 02:47:35,261
because you were just taxing that

4012
02:47:31,671 --> 02:47:37,640
nicotine portion but not at this same

4013
02:47:35,261 --> 02:47:39,860
calculation that we're using currently

4014
02:47:37,640 --> 02:47:41,390
and for Miss Ajax in your opinion how

4015
02:47:39,860 --> 02:47:45,909
bad is the cannabis black-market

4016
02:47:41,390 --> 02:47:45,909
impacting legitimate cannabis business

4017
02:47:46,091 --> 02:47:51,771
well it's probably it's a number one

4018
02:47:48,890 --> 02:47:55,190
complaint that we get the complaints

4019
02:47:51,771 --> 02:47:57,381
coming into the bureau is the unlicensed

4020
02:47:55,190 --> 02:48:00,140
market and how its directly competing

4021
02:47:57,380 --> 02:48:04,279
with our licensees and I think we all

4022
02:48:00,140 --> 02:48:05,709
agree with you that enforcement is a top

4023
02:48:04,280 --> 02:48:09,220
priority and

4024
02:48:05,709 --> 02:48:11,679
you all work here together very well to

4025
02:48:09,219 --> 02:48:13,809
combat that and partner together to make

4026
02:48:11,680 --> 02:48:17,860
sure we're attacking the illegal market

4027
02:48:13,809 --> 02:48:18,789
but it there there there it is very

4028
02:48:17,860 --> 02:48:22,360
prevalent here

4029
02:48:18,790 --> 02:48:24,700
do you have sufficient resources I think

4030
02:48:22,360 --> 02:48:27,159
between all of us working together as a

4031
02:48:24,700 --> 02:48:29,170
state we have we do have substantial

4032
02:48:27,159 --> 02:48:31,329
resources I think we're still learning

4033
02:48:29,170 --> 02:48:34,739
the scope of the problem

4034
02:48:31,329 --> 02:48:37,809
and again we feel it's a top priority

4035
02:48:34,739 --> 02:48:39,639
one of the things that you've all of us

4036
02:48:37,809 --> 02:48:43,119
collaborate and it's not just the people

4037
02:48:39,639 --> 02:48:44,769
at this table it's with CDFA and local

4038
02:48:43,120 --> 02:48:47,050
law enforcement has been huge with

4039
02:48:44,770 --> 02:48:49,450
assisting us with some of these you know

4040
02:48:47,049 --> 02:48:53,439
serving these search warrants and but

4041
02:48:49,450 --> 02:48:55,120
what about your resources at BCC we have

4042
02:48:53,440 --> 02:48:58,659
resources you know we're still

4043
02:48:55,120 --> 02:49:01,780
sufficient we're still building our

4044
02:48:58,659 --> 02:49:02,649
structure uh-huh so well I'll cut you

4045
02:49:01,780 --> 02:49:04,479
off there I've never heard any

4046
02:49:02,649 --> 02:49:06,969
department head in my five years here

4047
02:49:04,478 --> 02:49:08,799
come forward and say no we don't have to

4048
02:49:06,969 --> 02:49:10,389
figure resources because we know who

4049
02:49:08,799 --> 02:49:12,159
their boss is so I get this you don't

4050
02:49:10,389 --> 02:49:13,629
want to diss your boss like I understand

4051
02:49:12,159 --> 02:49:15,969
that you want to be you want to be

4052
02:49:13,629 --> 02:49:17,769
politically correct but that's a big

4053
02:49:15,969 --> 02:49:20,709
issue you know I'll be honest with one

4054
02:49:17,770 --> 02:49:23,890
thing it's the state the pay sucks

4055
02:49:20,709 --> 02:49:25,539
sewing governor brown gut it being a

4056
02:49:23,889 --> 02:49:27,129
Bruin our clock enforcement there's a

4057
02:49:25,540 --> 02:49:29,050
lot of expertise here that has gone

4058
02:49:27,129 --> 02:49:31,449
that's been gone there is no expertise

4059
02:49:29,049 --> 02:49:32,199
with that sonar Cox is not something you

4060
02:49:31,450 --> 02:49:34,150
learned overnight

4061
02:49:32,200 --> 02:49:36,159
I spent 10 years there so it takes a

4062
02:49:34,149 --> 02:49:37,750
long time to develop the expertise so

4063
02:49:36,159 --> 02:49:39,940
most folks are in local agencies that

4064
02:49:37,750 --> 02:49:42,159
have that expertise so the state it's

4065
02:49:39,940 --> 02:49:44,560
tough to do that the pay sucks

4066
02:49:42,159 --> 02:49:45,610
and with pepra you know it's just very

4067
02:49:44,559 --> 02:49:48,189
different versions of cities and

4068
02:49:45,610 --> 02:49:49,780
counties so that's the tough part you

4069
02:49:48,190 --> 02:49:52,060
deal with it's finding the folks that

4070
02:49:49,780 --> 02:49:54,280
are capable that can do it so to me it

4071
02:49:52,059 --> 02:49:55,809
goes back to local law enforcement tap

4072
02:49:54,280 --> 02:49:57,610
those folks be an integral part of this

4073
02:49:55,809 --> 02:49:59,859
to deal with us they have the expertise

4074
02:49:57,610 --> 02:50:02,290
that need the funding there to make

4075
02:49:59,860 --> 02:50:04,440
these investigations and do them you

4076
02:50:02,290 --> 02:50:06,790
know we've got thousands of illegal

4077
02:50:04,440 --> 02:50:08,530
storefronts in LA with the right

4078
02:50:06,790 --> 02:50:10,090
resources they can do it and then also

4079
02:50:08,530 --> 02:50:11,700
changing it on the district when you get

4080
02:50:10,090 --> 02:50:14,620
it marijuana you run into marijuana

4081
02:50:11,700 --> 02:50:16,390
whatever flour whatever they call it do

4082
02:50:14,620 --> 02:50:18,900
destruction right away because the

4083
02:50:16,389 --> 02:50:21,489
reason law enforcement isn't seized

4084
02:50:18,899 --> 02:50:23,739
cannabis or flour or whatever is because

4085
02:50:21,489 --> 02:50:24,850
you have to store it and you get

4086
02:50:23,739 --> 02:50:26,949
thousands of plants to store in a

4087
02:50:24,850 --> 02:50:28,750
warehouse for a year or six months

4088
02:50:26,950 --> 02:50:30,490
whatever it's not feasible I spend law

4089
02:50:28,750 --> 02:50:32,049
enforcement doesn't take it versus

4090
02:50:30,489 --> 02:50:34,569
having an immediate destruction order

4091
02:50:32,049 --> 02:50:36,039
you destroy that and all the implements

4092
02:50:34,569 --> 02:50:37,149
associated with it and if you've got a

4093
02:50:36,040 --> 02:50:38,980
doctor's note that would leave you

4094
02:50:37,149 --> 02:50:41,920
you're 11 plants we're taking everything

4095
02:50:38,979 --> 02:50:44,129
else so it's got to change that until

4096
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:46,120
this body gets off its butt

4097
02:50:44,129 --> 02:50:48,520
nothing's gonna change this whatsoever

4098
02:50:46,120 --> 02:50:50,650
it starts in a legislature and we can't

4099
02:50:48,521 --> 02:50:53,140
get a hit bill for a hearing in a damn

4100
02:50:50,649 --> 02:50:53,709
committee that's the problem that is a

4101
02:50:53,139 --> 02:50:55,119
problem

4102
02:50:53,709 --> 02:50:57,459
you have great bills that come through

4103
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:59,140
that are reasonable not crazy stuff but

4104
02:50:57,459 --> 02:51:02,619
they don't want to hear it so that's

4105
02:50:59,139 --> 02:51:05,329
gonna happen in the committee so that's

4106
02:51:02,620 --> 02:51:06,630
really what it comes down to you know

4107
02:51:05,329 --> 02:51:11,289
[Music]

4108
02:51:06,629 --> 02:51:12,939
thank you very much mr. Cooper dr.

4109
02:51:11,290 --> 02:51:15,610
winter yeah just really breathe Leslie

4110
02:51:12,940 --> 02:51:18,370
thank you I know I feel like you you you

4111
02:51:15,610 --> 02:51:20,200
know sound harsh but I'm really

4112
02:51:18,370 --> 02:51:21,640
appreciate the work you're doing and I

4113
02:51:20,200 --> 02:51:23,290
feel like you probably feel like you're

4114
02:51:21,639 --> 02:51:26,559
swimming upstream all the time and and

4115
02:51:23,290 --> 02:51:28,810
you know we gave we gave the industry

4116
02:51:26,559 --> 02:51:31,930
tools to be come into compliance

4117
02:51:28,809 --> 02:51:33,729
we gave time for people to come into

4118
02:51:31,930 --> 02:51:36,010
compliance and it's frustrating that 80%

4119
02:51:33,729 --> 02:51:38,139
of the the industry has chosen not to do

4120
02:51:36,010 --> 02:51:41,260
that and that we don't have the tools to

4121
02:51:38,139 --> 02:51:42,939
enforce against that you know in in a

4122
02:51:41,260 --> 02:51:45,521
more expeditious way maybe that's the

4123
02:51:42,940 --> 02:51:48,220
right way to say it I don't I don't know

4124
02:51:45,521 --> 02:51:50,710
but it feels like it feels like it's

4125
02:51:48,219 --> 02:51:53,409
like whack-a-mole probably in in some

4126
02:51:50,709 --> 02:51:54,639
places and and you know it's unfair to

4127
02:51:53,409 --> 02:51:57,369
the folks that have gone through all the

4128
02:51:54,639 --> 02:51:58,930
hoops and to do it right so I thank you

4129
02:51:57,370 --> 02:52:02,710
for everything you you all are doing

4130
02:51:58,930 --> 02:52:05,290
appreciate it and before I get into any

4131
02:52:02,709 --> 02:52:07,449
final closing comments did any of the

4132
02:52:05,290 --> 02:52:09,340
five of you wish to share any

4133
02:52:07,450 --> 02:52:11,560
observations or responses to any of the

4134
02:52:09,340 --> 02:52:16,000
dialogue that was previously made on

4135
02:52:11,559 --> 02:52:17,649
this Dyess seeing none no okay I also

4136
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:19,719
want to echo those comments and the deep

4137
02:52:17,649 --> 02:52:21,399
appreciation as a doctor would a number

4138
02:52:19,719 --> 02:52:24,129
of my colleagues on the work that you

4139
02:52:21,399 --> 02:52:25,270
are doing please interpret our comments

4140
02:52:24,129 --> 02:52:27,849
is saying that we want to best

4141
02:52:25,271 --> 02:52:29,620
understand how to best empower and equip

4142
02:52:27,850 --> 02:52:31,930
you with the tools necessary and the

4143
02:52:29,620 --> 02:52:32,710
resources necessary to better to do the

4144
02:52:31,930 --> 02:52:35,500
jobs

4145
02:52:32,709 --> 02:52:37,629
you know is important to do for the

4146
02:52:35,500 --> 02:52:40,420
largest regulated market in the world

4147
02:52:37,629 --> 02:52:42,818
arguably similarly along those lines

4148
02:52:40,420 --> 02:52:45,309
it's clear that you have all stated some

4149
02:52:42,818 --> 02:52:47,619
deficiencies in the areas of opportunity

4150
02:52:45,309 --> 02:52:50,978
and the lost opportunities that you have

4151
02:52:47,620 --> 02:52:52,840
had and would like to tell you to help

4152
02:52:50,978 --> 02:52:54,879
create a greater sense of urgency you've

4153
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:57,398
talked about the lack of enforcement a

4154
02:52:54,879 --> 02:53:00,219
slap on the wrist comments like just in

4155
02:52:57,398 --> 02:53:02,799
normal modes of operating procedure for

4156
02:53:00,219 --> 02:53:04,719
many of these individuals but to come to

4157
02:53:02,799 --> 02:53:06,909
us and say this is what we are seeing

4158
02:53:04,719 --> 02:53:08,469
we need the authority the legislative

4159
02:53:06,909 --> 02:53:10,689
support to be able to tackle these

4160
02:53:08,469 --> 02:53:12,579
issues it's also clear to me that there

4161
02:53:10,689 --> 02:53:15,670
are a number of various entities that

4162
02:53:12,579 --> 02:53:18,039
oversee this of enforcement and with in

4163
02:53:15,670 --> 02:53:22,359
cannabis vaping alike we also talk about

4164
02:53:18,040 --> 02:53:24,910
local control and state position as well

4165
02:53:22,359 --> 02:53:26,529
perhaps my colleagues may also join me

4166
02:53:24,909 --> 02:53:28,478
in exploring then perhaps a

4167
02:53:26,529 --> 02:53:30,790
consolidation interdepartmental status

4168
02:53:28,478 --> 02:53:33,429
to make sure that we have a uniform

4169
02:53:30,790 --> 02:53:35,160
approach to some of these areas so we

4170
02:53:33,430 --> 02:53:37,779
have a sense of consistency

4171
02:53:35,159 --> 02:53:39,459
accountability and transparency so that

4172
02:53:37,779 --> 02:53:41,680
we can have a sense of how we are

4173
02:53:39,459 --> 02:53:43,929
tackling this all in one house as well -

4174
02:53:41,680 --> 02:53:45,720
so the efficiencies I think as mr.

4175
02:53:43,930 --> 02:53:47,770
Cooper also mentioned is very important

4176
02:53:45,719 --> 02:53:49,688
similarly I also want to make a point

4177
02:53:47,770 --> 02:53:52,988
that we oftentimes in this legislative

4178
02:53:49,689 --> 02:53:54,909
body have sought to try and address many

4179
02:53:52,988 --> 02:53:56,318
of these different issues in fact when

4180
02:53:54,909 --> 02:53:58,329
we talk about that of local control

4181
02:53:56,318 --> 02:54:00,398
cities saying that we want to maintain

4182
02:53:58,329 --> 02:54:02,620
local control when in fact I say again

4183
02:54:00,398 --> 02:54:05,289
cities are not in control there are

4184
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:07,689
unlicensed dispensaries operating all

4185
02:54:05,290 --> 02:54:09,850
the time in many different places and so

4186
02:54:07,689 --> 02:54:12,389
when we then say let us help open up the

4187
02:54:09,850 --> 02:54:16,029
regulated market for a bill proposal on

4188
02:54:12,389 --> 02:54:19,778
commensurate licenses on ABC licenses in

4189
02:54:16,029 --> 02:54:21,939
cities that bill does not pass we also

4190
02:54:19,779 --> 02:54:23,979
saw a bill prohibiting delivery that

4191
02:54:21,939 --> 02:54:28,090
bill did not pass we saw a piece of

4192
02:54:23,978 --> 02:54:30,728
legislation to lower excise tax that did

4193
02:54:28,090 --> 02:54:33,760
not pass so we are attempting to do what

4194
02:54:30,728 --> 02:54:36,969
we can but what I think is going to be

4195
02:54:33,760 --> 02:54:39,340
helpful is if you help provide us the

4196
02:54:36,969 --> 02:54:41,648
specifics and saying the justification

4197
02:54:39,340 --> 02:54:43,270
is very clear which arguably I would

4198
02:54:41,648 --> 02:54:44,648
suggest and argue but it'll leave it to

4199
02:54:43,270 --> 02:54:46,180
public comment that is actually in

4200
02:54:44,648 --> 02:54:46,959
unison to that of what you're hearing

4201
02:54:46,180 --> 02:54:49,960
from indice

4202
02:54:46,959 --> 02:54:51,339
which is we regulated in the industry

4203
02:54:49,959 --> 02:54:54,039
that is represented in this audience

4204
02:54:51,340 --> 02:54:55,478
also say we want to join in lockstep we

4205
02:54:54,040 --> 02:54:57,040
are willing to pay our taxes we were

4206
02:54:55,478 --> 02:54:58,779
willing to pay our fees we know who the

4207
02:54:57,040 --> 02:55:01,840
bad actors are we want to be in the

4208
02:54:58,780 --> 02:55:04,060
regulated market but they feel like they

4209
02:55:01,840 --> 02:55:06,430
are not surviving and not only is that

4210
02:55:04,059 --> 02:55:08,350
that individuals are dying as we've all

4211
02:55:06,430 --> 02:55:11,290
know but small business owners are also

4212
02:55:08,350 --> 02:55:12,220
dying so there needs to be a greater

4213
02:55:11,290 --> 02:55:15,220
sense of urgency

4214
02:55:12,219 --> 02:55:17,949
so we implore you to help create that

4215
02:55:15,219 --> 02:55:19,869
sense of urgency for us because we want

4216
02:55:17,950 --> 02:55:22,210
to work within the state budgets help

4217
02:55:19,870 --> 02:55:24,370
give you more tools and resources and

4218
02:55:22,209 --> 02:55:26,049
people we also want to change the

4219
02:55:24,370 --> 02:55:27,570
legislations help empower you so that

4220
02:55:26,049 --> 02:55:31,119
you can go after the bad actors alike

4221
02:55:27,569 --> 02:55:34,119
and then also message very clear to the

4222
02:55:31,120 --> 02:55:36,370
administration that this is an

4223
02:55:34,120 --> 02:55:38,620
informational hearing that has engaged

4224
02:55:36,370 --> 02:55:40,510
with broad public support of all

4225
02:55:38,620 --> 02:55:43,090
stakeholders so that when you see pieces

4226
02:55:40,510 --> 02:55:45,520
of legislation that comes from us this

4227
02:55:43,090 --> 02:55:47,829
is getting the administration involved

4228
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:49,600
and stakeholders alike so again we want

4229
02:55:47,829 --> 02:55:51,850
to work hand-in-hand with each and every

4230
02:55:49,600 --> 02:55:54,040
one of you and you provide us some good

4231
02:55:51,850 --> 02:55:55,750
tools and recommendations alike but

4232
02:55:54,040 --> 02:55:58,420
again we need to create a greater sense

4233
02:55:55,750 --> 02:56:00,760
of urgency for this because this is of

4234
02:55:58,420 --> 02:56:03,430
immense importance to not only public

4235
02:56:00,760 --> 02:56:05,829
health but the future that will

4236
02:56:03,430 --> 02:56:07,960
transcend the long before long after we

4237
02:56:05,829 --> 02:56:09,250
will we will be here respectively in

4238

02:56:22,030 --> 02:56:26,800
move to the final panel of the day what

4245
02:56:25,149 --> 02:56:29,649
are the health effects associated with

4246
02:56:26,799 --> 02:56:31,179
vaping and electronic cigarettes of what

4247
02:56:29,649 --> 02:56:34,270
more needs to be done we welcome dr.

dr. charity Dean acting state public

4256
02:56:49,890 --> 02:56:53,699
health officer at the California

4257
02:56:51,601 --> 02:56:55,860
Department of Public Health thank you

4258
02:56:53,700 --> 02:56:58,400
for allowing me to provide an update on

4259
02:56:55,860 --> 02:57:00,690
the vaping associated pulmonary injury

4260
02:56:58,399 --> 02:57:03,569
the current status of the VAP II

4261
02:57:00,690 --> 02:57:07,771
outbreak is alarming nationally there

4262
02:57:03,569 --> 02:57:10,170
have been 1299 cases and at least 26

4263
02:57:07,771 --> 02:57:13,530
deaths the National Centers for Disease

4264
02:57:10,170 --> 02:57:17,760
Control and Prevention reports 76% of

4265
02:57:13,530 --> 02:57:19,800
patient self-report using THC today new

4266
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:22,290
data was posted on the California

4267
02:57:19,799 --> 02:57:25,350
Department of Public Health website CDP

4268
02:57:22,290 --> 02:57:27,391
HCA gov and I'm going to discuss it

4269
02:57:25,351 --> 02:57:30,659
we've had a hundred and thirty three

4270
02:57:27,390 --> 02:57:34,739
cases in California three deaths the

4271
02:57:30,659 --> 02:57:36,810
median age of cases has been 27 all of

4272
02:57:34,739 --> 02:57:41,010
those cases have been hospitalized of

4273
02:57:36,810 --> 02:57:44,729
those 43% required care in the intensive

4274
02:57:41,010 --> 02:57:49,409
care unit and 28% required mechanical

4275
02:57:44,729 --> 02:57:51,539
intubation 78 of those cases have been

4276
02:57:49,409 --> 02:57:53,579
interviewed this means that they

4277
02:57:51,540 --> 02:57:55,470
self-report to the person interviewing

4278
02:57:53,579 --> 02:57:59,670
them what they used and where they

4279
02:57:55,469 --> 02:58:02,100
obtained the product the cases report

4280
02:57:59,670 --> 02:58:05,729
vaping or dabbing mostly cannabis

4281
02:58:02,101 --> 02:58:10,380
products in waxes oils and other forms

4282
02:58:05,729 --> 02:58:16,069
of the 78 interviewed 81 percent

4283
02:58:10,379 --> 02:58:19,979
self-report using THC 38 percent use CBD

4284
02:58:16,069 --> 02:58:22,199
47 percent used nicotine most used a

4285
02:58:19,979 --> 02:58:26,520
combination of these and only 10 percent

4286
02:58:22,200 --> 02:58:29,159
reported using only nicotine there was

4287
02:58:26,521 --> 02:58:32,940
one case that did self-report purchasing

4288
02:58:29,159 --> 02:58:34,680
from a confirmed licensed retailer many

4289
02:58:32,940 --> 02:58:36,690
aspects of that are being investigated

4290
02:58:34,680 --> 02:58:40,739
and that investigation is still ongoing

4291
02:58:36,690 --> 02:58:42,930
the remaining cases whose self-reported

4292
02:58:40,739 --> 02:58:45,601
during the interview stated that they

4293
02:58:42,930 --> 02:58:48,829
had purchased their vaping products from

4294
02:58:45,601 --> 02:58:52,470
illicit street vendors pop-up shops

4295
02:58:48,829 --> 02:58:55,079
social contacts or unverified sellers

4296
02:58:52,469 --> 02:58:57,519
and by unverified sellers we mean

4297
02:58:55,079 --> 02:58:59,770
retailers that either could not be

4298
02:58:57,520 --> 02:59:02,979
located or could not be verified as

4299
02:58:59,770 --> 02:59:04,539
having a license there are multiple

4300
02:59:02,978 --> 02:59:06,629
patterns of lung injury which are

4301
02:59:04,539 --> 02:59:10,659
emerging based on the medical findings

4302
02:59:06,629 --> 02:59:13,000
from tissue biopsies autopsies and blood

4303
02:59:10,658 --> 02:59:15,908
work many of these are now emerging in

4304
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:17,590
published literature I'm going to list a

4305
02:59:15,908 --> 02:59:21,368
few that you may have heard of in the

4306
02:59:17,590 --> 02:59:23,020
media exogenously Boyd pneumonia the

4307
02:59:21,369 --> 02:59:26,020
theory behind that was that inhaling

4308
02:59:23,020 --> 02:59:28,300
vaporized oils can cause this clinical

4309
02:59:26,020 --> 02:59:30,720
syndrome that can be seen on some of the

4310
02:59:28,299 --> 02:59:33,398
clinical specimens like lung washings

4311
02:59:30,719 --> 02:59:37,328
chemical pneumonitis or chemical

4312
02:59:33,398 --> 02:59:39,629
inhalation injury acute asana philic

4313
02:59:37,328 --> 02:59:43,029
pneumonia bronchiolitis obliterans

4314
02:59:39,629 --> 02:59:45,908
diffuse alveolar damage diffuse alveolar

4315
02:59:43,029 --> 02:59:48,340
hemorrhage all of these involve acute

4316
02:59:45,908 --> 02:59:49,719
lung injury and inflammation so you can

4317
02:59:48,340 --> 02:59:51,369
see that there are now a number of

4318
02:59:49,719 --> 02:59:54,788
different clinical syndromes that are

4319
02:59:51,369 --> 02:59:57,279
emerging not just one the challenge

4320
02:59:54,789 --> 03:00:00,430
there is that multiple patterns of lung

4321
02:59:57,279 --> 03:00:02,289
injury suggest multiple mechanisms which

4322
03:00:00,430 --> 03:00:04,658
in turn suggest that there may be

4323
03:00:02,289 --> 03:00:08,489
multiple different causes different

4324
03:00:04,658 --> 03:00:10,779
chemicals leading to this not just one

4325
03:00:08,488 --> 03:00:13,658
extensive laboratory testing is being

4326
03:00:10,779 --> 03:00:15,789
done nationally there are published and

4327
03:00:13,658 --> 03:00:18,279
anecdotal reports from labs at the

4328
03:00:15,789 --> 03:00:20,109
federal and state level all of them

4329
03:00:18,279 --> 03:00:23,319
agree that at this point there is no

4330
03:00:20,109 --> 03:00:26,289
single device substance product or

4331
03:00:23,318 --> 03:00:28,318
device type that has been identified as

4332
03:00:26,289 --> 03:00:31,270
the cause of the outbreak

4333
03:00:28,318 --> 03:00:35,019
vitamin E acetate has been recovered

4334
03:00:31,270 --> 03:00:36,930
from some products but not all the

4335
03:00:35,020 --> 03:00:40,479
California Department of Public Health

4336
03:00:36,930 --> 03:00:42,908
received 146 cartridges or pods which

4337
03:00:40,478 --> 03:00:45,549
were voluntarily surrendered by patients

4338
03:00:42,908 --> 03:00:48,699
and the extensive testing is ongoing

4339
03:00:45,549 --> 03:00:50,889
there are many unknowns when I would

4340
03:00:48,699 --> 03:00:53,920
highlight is the unknown of what happens

4341
03:00:50,889 --> 03:00:57,670
when you mix chemicals together heat

4342
03:00:53,920 --> 03:00:58,988
that mixture and aerosolize it which may

4343
03:00:57,670 --> 03:01:01,568
create new

4344
03:00:58,988 --> 03:01:04,600
toxic compounds The effect of which on

4345
03:01:01,568 --> 03:01:06,698
the lung tissue is unknown another

4346
03:01:04,600 --> 03:01:09,250
unknown our variables intrinsic in the

4347
03:01:06,699 --> 03:01:11,319
devices themselves heating elements

4348
03:01:09,250 --> 03:01:13,748
batteries refillable cartridge

4349
03:01:11,318 --> 03:01:15,878
and medals and again the combination of

4350
03:01:13,748 --> 03:01:18,458
these with heat may be creating unknown

4351
03:01:15,879 --> 03:01:21,489
substances that we don't even know to

4352
03:01:18,459 --> 03:01:23,350
test for the California Department of

4353
03:01:21,488 --> 03:01:26,439
Public Health has had a robust response

4354
03:01:23,350 --> 03:01:28,748
to this outbreak the medical and Health

4355
03:01:26,439 --> 03:01:31,588
Coordination Center was activated in

4356
03:01:28,748 --> 03:01:34,270
August it is now activated at level two

4357
03:01:31,588 --> 03:01:37,299
we have issued three Cahan alerts

4358
03:01:34,270 --> 03:01:39,238
statewide multiple health advisories

4359
03:01:37,299 --> 03:01:42,278
including to the public and to

4360
03:01:39,238 --> 03:01:43,838
healthcare professionals we issued a

4361
03:01:42,279 --> 03:01:47,260
press release and have been very

4362
03:01:43,838 --> 03:01:49,539
responsive to media inquiries from the

4363
03:01:47,260 --> 03:01:51,760
beginning from August from the first day

4364
03:01:49,539 --> 03:01:53,619
we've collaborated with our national

4365
03:01:51,760 --> 03:01:55,838
partners at the federal level with the

4366
03:01:53,619 --> 03:01:58,539
CDC with other states that were

4367
03:01:55,838 --> 03:02:00,668
reporting clusters with our local health

4368
03:01:58,539 --> 03:02:03,510
jurisdictions and with providers in

4369
03:02:00,668 --> 03:02:06,128
California across our department

4370
03:02:03,510 --> 03:02:08,318
multiple centers have been involved they

4371
03:02:06,129 --> 03:02:11,199
have all come together to offer staff

4372
03:02:08,318 --> 03:02:13,059
and expertise to respond I especially

4373
03:02:11,199 --> 03:02:14,890
want to mention the work of our state

4374
03:02:13,059 --> 03:02:15,878
public health laboratories where it's

4375
03:02:14,889 --> 03:02:18,368
been a team effort

4376
03:02:15,879 --> 03:02:21,579
to synthesize and test various chemical

4377
03:02:18,369 --> 03:02:24,039
hypotheses description of the emerging

4378
03:02:21,578 --> 03:02:26,139
clinical syndrome includes respiratory

4379
03:02:24,039 --> 03:02:29,739
symptoms such as cough or nests of

4380
03:02:26,139 --> 03:02:32,528
breath chest pain and GI symptoms

4381
03:02:29,738 --> 03:02:35,020
including abdominal pain nausea vomiting

4382
03:02:32,529 --> 03:02:38,949
diarrhea but it also includes fever

4383
03:02:35,020 --> 03:02:41,439
fatigue and weakness patients present

4384
03:02:38,949 --> 03:02:43,359
with low oxygen levels which is why many

4385
03:02:41,439 --> 03:02:45,729
of them need to be in the intensive care

4386
03:02:43,359 --> 03:02:48,158
unit with supplemental oxygen they have

4387
03:02:45,728 --> 03:02:50,618
an abnormal chest x-ray many have an

4388
03:02:48,158 --> 03:02:52,838
abnormal CT scan as well showing

4389
03:02:50,619 --> 03:02:56,498
bilateral and filtrates on both sides of

4390
03:02:52,838 --> 03:02:58,600
their lungs not just one the unknown or

4391
03:02:56,498 --> 03:03:00,998
I'm sorry the long term health effects

4392
03:02:58,600 --> 03:03:02,918
are unknown because this is an emerging

4393
03:03:00,998 --> 03:03:04,478
clinical syndrome we're looking very

4394
03:03:02,918 --> 03:03:07,119
carefully at what's happening right now

4395
03:03:04,478 --> 03:03:09,278
but what happens when these patients

4396
03:03:07,119 --> 03:03:09,879
leave the hospital how quick is their

4397
03:03:09,279 --> 03:03:12,158
recovery

4398
03:03:09,879 --> 03:03:14,739
will they have lifelong adverse health

4399
03:03:12,158 --> 03:03:17,828
effects on their lungs we don't know

4400
03:03:14,738 --> 03:03:20,078
that yet one of the challenges is this

4401
03:03:17,828 --> 03:03:22,779
is a diagnosis of exclusion which is why

4402
03:03:20,078 --> 03:03:24,449
I mentioned this symptoms in order to

4403
03:03:22,779 --> 03:03:26,790
make the diagnosis of a

4404
03:03:24,450 --> 03:03:28,891
PK's you have to first rule out

4405
03:03:26,790 --> 03:03:31,530
infectious causes or other plausible

4406
03:03:28,890 --> 03:03:34,890
causes this will be a challenge during

4407
03:03:31,530 --> 03:03:37,050
upcoming influenza season so how do we

4408
03:03:34,890 --> 03:03:39,119
find the cause the public health

4409
03:03:37,049 --> 03:03:42,270
approach to this as it is to many other

4410
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:45,120
outbreaks is a combination of examining

4411
03:03:42,271 --> 03:03:47,340
the epidemiology data the clinical

4412
03:03:45,120 --> 03:03:50,130
syndrome the course of illness in the

4413
03:03:47,340 --> 03:03:52,771
patient the patient's clinical specimens

4414
03:03:50,129 --> 03:03:55,589
and of course the laboratory analysis of

4415
03:03:52,771 --> 03:03:57,570
the vaping products themselves and it

4416
03:03:55,590 --> 03:03:59,549
will be that information dovetailing

4417
03:03:57,569 --> 03:04:02,520
together that will get us closer to an

4418
03:03:59,549 --> 03:04:04,920
answer it could take years for the

4419
03:04:02,521 --> 03:04:07,290
medical and scientific community to

4420
03:04:04,920 --> 03:04:10,440
definitively determine what the causes

4421
03:04:07,290 --> 03:04:12,360
are public health recommendations for

4422
03:04:10,440 --> 03:04:14,340
the public are important and we've been

4423
03:04:12,360 --> 03:04:17,010
sharing them in our publicly shared a

4424
03:04:14,340 --> 03:04:20,010
press release and health alerts number

4425
03:04:17,010 --> 03:04:22,829
one we recommend that the public refrain

4426
03:04:20,010 --> 03:04:25,140
from vaping no matter the source there

4427
03:04:22,829 --> 03:04:27,450
is always a risk when you inhale a

4428
03:04:25,140 --> 03:04:31,590
foreign substance into your lungs and

4429
03:04:27,450 --> 03:04:33,780
the risk of vaping now includes death it

4430
03:04:31,590 --> 03:04:35,700
can be difficult for consumers to

4431
03:04:33,780 --> 03:04:38,311
distinguish between regulated and

4432
03:04:35,700 --> 03:04:40,141
unregulated products considering there

4433
03:04:38,310 --> 03:04:43,469
are counterfeit labels that can be very

4434
03:04:40,140 --> 03:04:46,350
deceptive number two for those who

4435
03:04:43,469 --> 03:04:50,430
choose to vape only purchase from a

4436
03:04:46,351 --> 03:04:52,771
verified licensed retailer number three

4437
03:04:50,431 --> 03:04:54,480
for someone who has recently vaped and

4438
03:04:52,771 --> 03:04:57,061
is experiencing some of these symptoms

4439
03:04:54,479 --> 03:04:59,189
they should seek care immediately and

4440
03:04:57,060 --> 03:05:01,110
they need to share their honest and

4441
03:04:59,190 --> 03:05:04,351
thorough vaping history and products

4442
03:05:01,110 --> 03:05:07,200
used with that provider and number four

4443
03:05:04,351 --> 03:05:07,829
if you stop vaping do not switch to

4444
03:05:07,200 --> 03:05:10,380
cigarettes

4445
03:05:07,829 --> 03:05:12,510
instead please consider using an FDA

4446
03:05:10,379 --> 03:05:14,189
approved quitting treatment that

4447
03:05:12,510 --> 03:05:15,780
concludes my remarks thank you for

4448
03:05:14,190 --> 03:05:17,420
allowing me to come today and I'll take

4449
03:05:15,780 --> 03:05:19,530
any questions you might have

4450
03:05:17,420 --> 03:05:22,170
thank you doctor at this time we'll

4451
03:05:19,530 --> 03:05:25,190
bring it back to the committee for any

4452
03:05:22,170 --> 03:05:25,190
questions comments

4453
03:05:25,329 --> 03:05:30,709
dr. yes first of all thank you very much

4454
03:05:28,129 --> 03:05:32,629
and I've we've even I've been thinking

4455
03:05:30,709 --> 03:05:34,669
about the challenges as we do in our

4456
03:05:32,629 --> 03:05:37,188
cold and flu season and how how you

4457
03:05:34,670 --> 03:05:38,898
distinguish that and the complications

4458
03:05:37,189 --> 03:05:41,689
that may arise from a person who does

4459
03:05:38,898 --> 03:05:43,698
have the cold or the flu and how much

4460
03:05:41,689 --> 03:05:46,600
one plus one might equal three and

4461
03:05:43,699 --> 03:05:49,520
that's not a good thing in this case so

4462
03:05:46,600 --> 03:05:53,420
appreciate your your comments around

4463
03:05:49,520 --> 03:05:55,908
that people that are self reporting are

4464
03:05:53,420 --> 03:05:57,859
they volunteering the product that

4465
03:05:55,908 --> 03:06:01,728
they've used if there's any residual

4466
03:05:57,859 --> 03:06:03,890
left for for testing as that is that and

4467
03:06:01,728 --> 03:06:06,170
and how many people are actually doing

4468
03:06:03,889 --> 03:06:09,590
that or is it or is it consumed and all

4469
03:06:06,170 --> 03:06:12,379
gone before they get to you sure some

4470
03:06:09,590 --> 03:06:14,478
patients are voluntarily turning over

4471
03:06:12,379 --> 03:06:16,879
the product and they're vaping device

4472
03:06:14,478 --> 03:06:18,619
and those are sent to the California

4473
03:06:16,879 --> 03:06:22,759
Department of Public Health to conduct

4474
03:06:18,620 --> 03:06:24,800
testing and and so all the result the

4475
03:06:22,760 --> 03:06:27,380
results are it takes a while to do that

4476
03:06:24,799 --> 03:06:29,568
obviously so it's been a very complex

4477
03:06:27,379 --> 03:06:31,369
analysis and we are looking at some of

4478
03:06:29,568 --> 03:06:33,459
those results but it really is in the

4479
03:06:31,370 --> 03:06:36,439
beginning stages of a comprehensive

4480
03:06:33,459 --> 03:06:40,188
laboratory analysis considering how many

4481
03:06:36,439 --> 03:06:48,470
chemicals have to be tested for thank

4482
03:06:40,189 --> 03:06:51,439
you first of all thank your testimony

4483
03:06:48,469 --> 03:06:54,619
when we first contact the department and

4484
03:06:51,439 --> 03:06:58,100
looked into at that time the reported

4485
03:06:54,620 --> 03:07:01,899
cases my recollection was sixty-two out

4486
03:06:58,100 --> 03:07:06,470
of 63 cases were reported THC with one

4487
03:07:01,898 --> 03:07:09,408
case unknown and I heard you said

4488
03:07:06,469 --> 03:07:10,938
earlier 81 percent THC so have there

4489
03:07:09,408 --> 03:07:13,068
been more cases has that has that

4490
03:07:10,939 --> 03:07:16,100
information changed since I last spoke

4491
03:07:13,068 --> 03:07:17,898
with the department sure I can't

4492
03:07:16,100 --> 03:07:21,380
remember that exact week because the

4493
03:07:17,898 --> 03:07:22,879
data is changing so rapidly but yes you

4494
03:07:21,379 --> 03:07:25,188
are correct right now

4495
03:07:22,879 --> 03:07:28,429
81 percent of the cases self-report

4496
03:07:25,189 --> 03:07:31,760
using THC the nuance is that many of the

4497
03:07:28,430 --> 03:07:34,279
cases are combining the THC with CBD and

4498
03:07:31,760 --> 03:07:36,710
with nicotine and so if you're to add up

4499
03:07:34,279 --> 03:07:38,210
the percentages that we the data that we

4500
03:07:36,709 --> 03:07:39,829
published on our website today you'll

4501
03:07:38,209 --> 03:07:42,469
see it doesn't add to a hundred percent

4502
03:07:39,829 --> 03:07:46,728
because many of them are combining the

4503
03:07:42,469 --> 03:07:50,000
substances together and in the media

4504
03:07:46,728 --> 03:07:51,829
reports of lung illnesses have at least

4505
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:54,469
it's been suggested linked to

4506
03:07:51,829 --> 03:07:57,620
black-market products and we've had a

4507
03:07:54,469 --> 03:07:59,539
lot of sketching about that today have

4508
03:07:57,620 --> 03:08:01,640
there been any cases of lung illness or

4509
03:07:59,540 --> 03:08:06,310
death for that matter who have used

4510
03:08:01,639 --> 03:08:08,959
legal cannabis products exclusively I

4511
03:08:06,309 --> 03:08:13,549
can only speak to the data that we have

4512
03:08:08,959 --> 03:08:16,488
for California of the 78 cases who were

4513
03:08:13,549 --> 03:08:20,059
interviewed in California there was only

4514
03:08:16,488 --> 03:08:23,148
one case whose self reported exclusively

4515
03:08:20,059 --> 03:08:25,459
purchasing from licensed retailers and

4516
03:08:23,148 --> 03:08:28,010
it's important to note that when we do

4517
03:08:25,459 --> 03:08:32,028
these epidemiology interviews for any

4518
03:08:28,010 --> 03:08:34,579
outbreak we're asking patients to use

4519
03:08:32,029 --> 03:08:37,640
their best recollection and self-report

4520
03:08:34,579 --> 03:08:39,770
to the interviewer and so we look at

4521
03:08:37,639 --> 03:08:42,500
every aspect of that and that's still

4522
03:08:39,770 --> 03:08:44,988
being investigated but that was only one

4523
03:08:42,500 --> 03:08:47,930
case that's off reported exclusively

4524
03:08:44,988 --> 03:08:50,789
legal retailers everyone else we can

4525
03:08:47,930 --> 03:08:52,590
assume based on their self-report

4526
03:08:50,790 --> 03:08:55,500
non-legal products or at least some non

4527
03:08:52,590 --> 03:08:57,870
illegal products that's correct

4528
03:08:55,500 --> 03:08:59,398
the rest whose self-reported even the

4529
03:08:57,870 --> 03:09:01,890
ones who may have mentioned a

4530
03:08:59,398 --> 03:09:04,139
brick-and-mortar location those were not

4531
03:09:01,889 --> 03:09:06,239
able to be found or not able to be

4532
03:09:04,139 --> 03:09:09,059
verified as licensed and how many of

4533
03:09:06,239 --> 03:09:13,500
them report exclusively using nicotine

4534
03:09:09,059 --> 03:09:16,469
vaping products and no THC or marijuana

4535
03:09:13,500 --> 03:09:22,079
products only 10% of the 78 who were

4536
03:09:16,469 --> 03:09:24,510
interviewed okay I asked my staff to do

4537
03:09:22,079 --> 03:09:27,539
a little research it struck me as odd

4538
03:09:24,510 --> 03:09:29,700
vaping is not a activity that only

4539
03:09:27,540 --> 03:09:33,000
occurs here in the United States but yet

4540
03:09:29,700 --> 03:09:36,479
I've heard nothing or read nothing about

4541
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:38,909
death illness etc due to vaping outside

4542
03:09:36,478 --> 03:09:40,889
of the United States can you speak to

4543
03:09:38,909 --> 03:09:44,579
that all have you seen any evidence or

4544
03:09:40,889 --> 03:09:47,398
reports worldwide there have been a

4545
03:09:44,579 --> 03:09:50,250
handful of cases reported in Canada I'm

4546
03:09:47,398 --> 03:09:52,978
not aware of these clusters or outbreak

4547
03:09:50,250 --> 03:09:56,100
emerging in other countries does that

4548
03:09:52,978 --> 03:09:58,769
strike you as odd it strikes me as

4549
03:09:56,100 --> 03:10:00,840
interesting and as we look at all the

4550
03:09:58,770 --> 03:10:03,390
possible causes in the United States

4551
03:10:00,840 --> 03:10:06,719
including our epi data our patients that

4552
03:10:03,389 --> 03:10:09,809
the clinical labs that's something that

4553
03:10:06,719 --> 03:10:15,898
we're being were looking at what changed

4554
03:10:09,809 --> 03:10:19,590
and why now thank you for your time and

4555
03:10:15,898 --> 03:10:21,599
appreciate the answers just a quick

4556
03:10:19,590 --> 03:10:22,950
follow-up and I appreciate your line of

4557
03:10:21,600 --> 03:10:24,779
questioning there so I think it's I

4558
03:10:22,950 --> 03:10:26,700
think it's really valuable we said

4559
03:10:24,779 --> 03:10:28,260
someone reported we had one person

4560
03:10:26,700 --> 03:10:32,250
report that they had purchased from a

4561
03:10:28,260 --> 03:10:34,978
licensed regulated cannabis facility was

4562
03:10:32,250 --> 03:10:36,750
that verified that that indeed was a

4563
03:10:34,978 --> 03:10:38,969
licensed facility or was that the

4564
03:10:36,750 --> 03:10:42,029
patient's recollection because they

4565
03:10:38,969 --> 03:10:44,639
thought it was a licensed facility that

4566
03:10:42,029 --> 03:10:46,800
investigation is still ongoing I'll I'll

4567
03:10:44,639 --> 03:10:48,809
tell you that we share we as public

4568
03:10:46,799 --> 03:10:50,909
health when we get those reports from

4569
03:10:48,809 --> 03:10:53,100
patients that were interviewed we share

4570
03:10:50,909 --> 03:10:55,859
them with BCC so that they can be

4571
03:10:53,100 --> 03:10:58,109
investigated in that one case the

4572
03:10:55,859 --> 03:11:00,450
facility the brick-and-mortar location

4573
03:10:58,109 --> 03:11:03,300
that was mentioned was confirmed to be

4574
03:11:00,450 --> 03:11:04,230
licensed but aspects of that are still

4575
03:11:03,299 --> 03:11:07,560
being investigated

4576
03:11:04,229 --> 03:11:09,810
Thank You mr. Lowe thank you very much

4577
03:11:07,560 --> 03:11:12,329
appreciate that the comments that you

4578
03:11:09,810 --> 03:11:14,579
made and if I remembered correctly you

4579
03:11:12,329 --> 03:11:16,709
had indicated that the data is still

4580
03:11:14,579 --> 03:11:19,771
inconclusive but that you are very much

4581
03:11:16,709 --> 03:11:21,810
looking to the distinction on what has

4582
03:11:19,771 --> 03:11:24,000
been recently introduced and that when

4583
03:11:21,810 --> 03:11:25,890
there is a conclusion and to hopefully

4584
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:27,329
finding the culprit that that

4585
03:11:25,890 --> 03:11:29,909
information will be readily available

4586
03:11:27,329 --> 03:11:32,459
but for members of the public when that

4587
03:11:29,909 --> 03:11:34,590
time comes to which then given your

4588
03:11:32,459 --> 03:11:36,869
research that you do find conclusive

4589
03:11:34,590 --> 03:11:39,090
evidence of where the culprit is what

4590
03:11:36,870 --> 03:11:41,250
then transpires so that we can ensure

4591
03:11:39,090 --> 03:11:42,870
that consumers will be protected does

4592
03:11:41,250 --> 03:11:44,610
that come from executive order does that

4593
03:11:42,870 --> 03:11:45,811
come from the administration then

4594
03:11:44,610 --> 03:11:49,560
working with the legislature how do you

4595
03:11:45,810 --> 03:11:52,920
see that happening I think that would

4596
03:11:49,560 --> 03:11:55,709
depend on what the culprit was it's not

4597
03:11:52,920 --> 03:11:57,899
clear that it's just the substance or

4598
03:11:55,709 --> 03:12:00,839
just the device it could even be a

4599
03:11:57,899 --> 03:12:03,420
combination of them so it seems that the

4600
03:12:00,840 --> 03:12:05,760
ability to stop the outbreak and and

4601
03:12:03,420 --> 03:12:08,040
remove the culprit substance or device

4602
03:12:05,760 --> 03:12:10,409
will depend on what it is right now a

4603
03:12:08,040 --> 03:12:13,470
number of hypotheses are being looked at

4604
03:12:10,409 --> 03:12:16,170
everything's on the table sure and so if

4605
03:12:13,469 --> 03:12:18,629
given any of those combinations and that

4606
03:12:16,170 --> 03:12:23,460
is the conclusion to which is causing

4607
03:12:18,629 --> 03:12:25,439
harm and death within transpires then do

4608
03:12:23,459 --> 03:12:27,060
we see the administration an executive

4609
03:12:25,440 --> 03:12:28,560
order does that in the legislation you

4610
03:12:27,060 --> 03:12:30,181
come to the legislature saying okay

4611
03:12:28,560 --> 03:12:32,369
here's what it is please pass the

4612
03:12:30,181 --> 03:12:35,460
legislation how do you see do you have a

4613
03:12:32,370 --> 03:12:38,101
sense on how that would then my sense is

4614
03:12:35,459 --> 03:12:40,949
that if we knew what was causing this

4615
03:12:38,101 --> 03:12:44,480
that swift action would be taken and all

4616
03:12:40,950 --> 03:12:48,329
options would be considered thank you

4617
03:12:44,479 --> 03:12:51,899
mr. Rivas and so that's a you know a

4618
03:12:48,329 --> 03:12:55,049
great question and certainly you know so

4619
03:12:51,899 --> 03:12:56,760
based on what you mentioned you know I

4620
03:12:55,049 --> 03:12:58,469
find it startling that this could take

4621
03:12:56,760 --> 03:13:01,140
years to find out what the culprit is

4622
03:12:58,469 --> 03:13:02,689
but based on where we are now it seems

4623
03:13:01,140 --> 03:13:05,010
like this is obviously an evolving issue

4624
03:13:02,690 --> 03:13:07,470
as you mentioned the data seems to be

4625
03:13:05,010 --> 03:13:09,899
changing and every state is handling

4626
03:13:07,469 --> 03:13:14,159
this crisis as it is from day to day in

4627
03:13:09,899 --> 03:13:15,840
their own way we as a state based on the

4628
03:13:14,159 --> 03:13:17,859
executive order that the governor signed

4629
03:13:15,840 --> 03:13:20,859
is that enough

4630
03:13:17,859 --> 03:13:27,609
is is that response enough for our state

4631
03:13:20,859 --> 03:13:29,590
with this crisis moving forward many

4632
03:13:27,609 --> 03:13:32,408
options are being considered to respond

4633
03:13:29,590 --> 03:13:34,420
to this crisis the recommendations in

4634
03:13:32,408 --> 03:13:37,750
response to the executive order are

4635
03:13:34,420 --> 03:13:40,420
still being finalized but many options

4636
03:13:37,750 --> 03:13:43,988
are on the table including swift actions

4637
03:13:40,420 --> 03:13:47,590
thorough options to address the outbreak

4638
03:13:43,988 --> 03:13:49,689
and the youth vaping epidemic even

4639
03:13:47,590 --> 03:13:52,059
though these are distinct issues the

4640
03:13:49,689 --> 03:13:54,789
outbreak of vaping lung injury and the

4641
03:13:52,059 --> 03:13:56,769
youth vaping epidemic they are related

4642
03:13:54,789 --> 03:13:58,149
there is some crossovers I think dr.

4643
03:13:56,770 --> 03:14:00,460
wood had pointed out at the beginning

4644
03:13:58,148 --> 03:14:03,578
and so the recommendations being

4645
03:14:00,459 --> 03:14:08,919
considered take a broad approach and

4646
03:14:03,578 --> 03:14:10,719
everything's on the table mr Wood yeah

4647
03:14:08,920 --> 03:14:11,738
finally finally thank you thank you is

4648
03:14:10,719 --> 03:14:13,179
the more I said you know the more we

4649
03:14:11,738 --> 03:14:15,728
hear the more you questions you come up

4650
03:14:13,180 --> 03:14:18,010
with but considering that actually

4651
03:14:15,728 --> 03:14:22,389
vaping has been around for a while and

4652
03:14:18,010 --> 03:14:24,728
not just nicotine but also cannabis does

4653
03:14:22,389 --> 03:14:27,398
it not surprise you that suddenly this

4654
03:14:24,728 --> 03:14:29,858
is happening this this this just feels

4655
03:14:27,398 --> 03:14:31,689
like this is isolated to something

4656
03:14:29,859 --> 03:14:34,359
because there have been other things you

4657
03:14:31,689 --> 03:14:36,309
know we go back to several years ago and

4658
03:14:34,359 --> 03:14:38,130
the cannabis industry that's there

4659
03:14:36,309 --> 03:14:40,090
Nathan's been going on for a while

4660
03:14:38,129 --> 03:14:41,049
certainly with nicotine has been going

4661
03:14:40,090 --> 03:14:44,170
on for a while but all of a sudden

4662
03:14:41,049 --> 03:14:47,469
whoosh there's something something's not

4663
03:14:44,170 --> 03:14:50,078
right and does is that that obviously is

4664
03:14:47,469 --> 03:14:54,549
is unusual does that does that surprise

4665
03:14:50,078 --> 03:14:57,430
you in some way yes and as we discuss

4666
03:14:54,549 --> 03:14:59,920
this with other states who were facing a

4667
03:14:57,430 --> 03:15:04,809
similar outbreak situation since August

4668
03:14:59,920 --> 03:15:06,578
that question emerged the increase in

4669
03:15:04,809 --> 03:15:09,068
cases that we're seeing is it an

4670
03:15:06,578 --> 03:15:11,170
artifact of us looking for them had they

4671
03:15:09,068 --> 03:15:13,568
been there all along

4672
03:15:11,170 --> 03:15:15,609
I believe in California the answer is no

4673
03:15:13,568 --> 03:15:18,609
that this is something new that we're

4674
03:15:15,609 --> 03:15:20,350
seeing that we haven't seen before we

4675
03:15:18,609 --> 03:15:22,149
don't know the cause yet so we don't

4676
03:15:20,350 --> 03:15:25,930
know why but we're looking at multiple

4677
03:15:22,148 --> 03:15:28,510
theories and asking what changed to

4678
03:15:25,930 --> 03:15:29,771
caused this spike in cases there are

4679
03:15:28,510 --> 03:15:32,560
reports in the literature

4680
03:15:29,771 --> 03:15:36,881
reporting similar vaping lung injury

4681
03:15:32,560 --> 03:15:38,351
cases from before August of 2019 but not

4682
03:15:36,880 --> 03:15:44,229
even close to the number that we're

4683
03:15:38,351 --> 03:15:48,011
seeing now that kind of brings me back

4684
03:15:44,229 --> 03:15:51,399
to that vitamin he asked it you

4685
03:15:48,011 --> 03:15:56,370
mentioned that wasn't an ingredient not

4686
03:15:51,399 --> 03:15:59,079
found in all cases but what do we know

4687
03:15:56,370 --> 03:16:01,360
about the effects of inhaling vitamin

4688
03:15:59,079 --> 03:16:03,601
aster I'm sorry the effects of what of

4689
03:16:01,360 --> 03:16:06,461
inhaling vitamin D estimate

4690
03:16:03,601 --> 03:16:08,801
do we know anything not a lot so one of

4691
03:16:06,460 --> 03:16:12,819
the challenges of investigating possible

4692
03:16:08,800 --> 03:16:16,149
culprits like vitamin E acetate is that

4693
03:16:12,819 --> 03:16:18,640
it's not just the substance itself so it

4694
03:16:16,149 --> 03:16:20,470
might be safe when ingested you can eat

4695
03:16:18,640 --> 03:16:22,149
it maybe it's a vitamin you know it's

4696
03:16:20,470 --> 03:16:24,761
something that we think may have health

4697
03:16:22,149 --> 03:16:27,011
benefits when eaten but when you heat it

4698
03:16:24,761 --> 03:16:29,711
up and you vaporize it and you'll inhale

4699
03:16:27,011 --> 03:16:32,110
it into the lung the effects that it has

4700
03:16:29,710 --> 03:16:35,680
on the lung tissue on the little air

4701
03:16:32,110 --> 03:16:38,200
sacs is unknown and so looking at each

4702
03:16:35,681 --> 03:16:40,899
culprit even as vitamin D acetate is

4703
03:16:38,200 --> 03:16:43,841
considered isn't just testing the actual

4704
03:16:40,899 --> 03:16:45,431
liquid itself it involves testing what

4705
03:16:43,841 --> 03:16:47,890
happens when it's vaporized our new

4706
03:16:45,431 --> 03:16:49,780
compounds created and then what happens

4707
03:16:47,890 --> 03:16:51,729
when it's inhaled into the lung what

4708
03:16:49,780 --> 03:16:54,011
does the tissue damage look like what do

4709
03:16:51,729 --> 03:16:55,720
the cells look like that's one of the

4710
03:16:54,011 --> 03:16:58,181
reasons why getting to the bottom of

4711
03:16:55,720 --> 03:17:01,060
this could take time because it could

4712
03:16:58,181 --> 03:17:04,601
involve Studies over a period of time

4713
03:17:01,060 --> 03:17:07,869
using animal models looking at a wide

4714
03:17:04,601 --> 03:17:09,310
range of toxins that are heated to the

4715
03:17:07,870 --> 03:17:13,120
point of being vaporized and then

4716
03:17:09,310 --> 03:17:14,739
inhaled into the lungs so I think your

4717
03:17:13,120 --> 03:17:17,771
original question was what is the effect

4718
03:17:14,739 --> 03:17:19,539
of vitamin E acetate a theory was that

4719
03:17:17,771 --> 03:17:22,961
that may have been what was causing the

4720
03:17:19,540 --> 03:17:28,471
lipoid pneumonia that is being examined

4721
03:17:22,960 --> 03:17:28,470
and studied and yet unknown

4722
03:17:30,340 --> 03:17:38,380
and my understanding is it's not it is

4723
03:17:34,478 --> 03:17:41,978
at this time a legal ingredient for

4724
03:17:38,379 --> 03:17:43,839
legal cannabis products is that correct

4725
03:17:41,978 --> 03:17:45,698
or is it in fact a banned ingredient

4726
03:17:43,840 --> 03:17:48,430
we're taking the action on that to your

4727
03:17:45,699 --> 03:17:50,760
knowledge on vitamin E acetate it's not

4728
03:17:48,430 --> 03:17:57,699
included in the list of things that

4729
03:17:50,760 --> 03:18:00,430
manufacturers must test for okay any

4730
03:17:57,699 --> 03:18:05,560
other questions comments before we make

4731
03:18:00,430 --> 03:18:07,359
her well and it is the back and forth

4732
03:18:05,559 --> 03:18:09,158
and it is it is making is one of the

4733
03:18:07,359 --> 03:18:10,720
challenges with when I'm supposed to be

4734
03:18:09,158 --> 03:18:11,859
specifically to the cannabis industry I

4735
03:18:10,719 --> 03:18:13,629
think is one of the challenges with this

4736
03:18:11,859 --> 03:18:15,850
industry there are things in the history

4737
03:18:13,629 --> 03:18:17,738
that have been used in the past that

4738
03:18:15,850 --> 03:18:19,658
were safe on other things I think

4739
03:18:17,738 --> 03:18:21,818
there's a there's a pesticide called

4740
03:18:19,658 --> 03:18:24,189
eagle 20 or some I may be saying it

4741
03:18:21,818 --> 03:18:25,959
wrong but was useful used on leafy

4742
03:18:24,189 --> 03:18:29,050
vegetables and other kinds of things and

4743
03:18:25,959 --> 03:18:32,919
it was safe but when you actually burned

4744
03:18:29,049 --> 03:18:34,778
it in Italy it it liberated cyanide so

4745
03:18:32,920 --> 03:18:39,818
that's obviously not safe and that was

4746
03:18:34,779 --> 03:18:42,250
not known by other people so because

4747
03:18:39,818 --> 03:18:44,680
we're not testing for it now through the

4748
03:18:42,250 --> 03:18:48,369
bureau there may be other things it

4749
03:18:44,680 --> 03:18:50,380
emerged vitamin D acetate on its own may

4750
03:18:48,369 --> 03:18:53,409
be perfectly safe but in this setting

4751
03:18:50,379 --> 03:18:57,278
may not and so it is particularly

4752
03:18:53,408 --> 03:19:00,368
challenging as people are some probably

4753
03:18:57,279 --> 03:19:02,529
experimenting quite frankly and adding

4754
03:19:00,369 --> 03:19:05,050
things to the products to enhance them

4755
03:19:02,529 --> 03:19:08,380
in some way but but this is this is not

4756
03:19:05,049 --> 03:19:10,299
an unusual occurrence or this this is an

4757
03:19:08,379 --> 03:19:12,818
isolated incident with this with the

4758
03:19:10,299 --> 03:19:14,228
industry and part of that is the

4759
03:19:12,818 --> 03:19:16,209
challenge of doing research and being

4760
03:19:14,228 --> 03:19:18,629
able to see what truly is safe and what

4761
03:19:16,209 --> 03:19:18,629
truly is a

4762
03:19:21,120 --> 03:19:29,280
I think I'm done thank you for your

4763
03:19:26,399 --> 03:19:32,989
testimony I think at this time we will

4764
03:19:29,280 --> 03:19:32,989
take any public comment

4765
03:19:35,350 --> 03:19:38,789
a few of us

4766
03:19:39,379 --> 03:19:42,469
[Music]

4767
03:19:44,440 --> 03:19:50,390
okay see we have significant interest in

4768
03:19:47,809 --> 03:19:54,289
public comment we're gonna ask you in

4769
03:19:50,389 --> 03:19:56,659
light of the length of the hearing here

4770
03:19:54,290 --> 03:19:59,870
to try to confine your comments to

4771
03:19:56,659 --> 03:20:02,450
around one minute thank you so much and

4772
03:19:59,870 --> 03:20:02,960
go ahead and begin name thank you so

4773
03:20:02,450 --> 03:20:04,610
much

4774
03:20:02,959 --> 03:20:05,989
I really really appreciate the

4775
03:20:04,610 --> 03:20:07,130
opportunity to talk with you today so

4776
03:20:05,989 --> 03:20:09,319
thank you to the chairs and the

4777
03:20:07,129 --> 03:20:10,879
committee my name is Lindsay Robinson

4778
03:20:09,319 --> 03:20:12,789
I'm the executive director of the

4779
03:20:10,879 --> 03:20:15,589
California cannabis Industry Association

4780
03:20:12,790 --> 03:20:17,930
we represent about 500 members across

4781
03:20:15,590 --> 03:20:20,780
the state and roughly 15,000 employees

4782
03:20:17,930 --> 03:20:22,639
the legal cannabis industry is extremely

4783
03:20:20,780 --> 03:20:24,950
concerned about the current vaping

4784
03:20:22,639 --> 03:20:27,079
issues as well as counterfeit products

4785
03:20:24,950 --> 03:20:29,060
flooding the illicit market we're

4786
03:20:27,079 --> 03:20:31,069
committed to building consumer safety

4787
03:20:29,059 --> 03:20:33,228
and confidence and our focus is on

4788
03:20:31,069 --> 03:20:35,329
Public Safety we look forward to a

4789
03:20:33,228 --> 03:20:37,010
continued partnership with the

4790
03:20:35,329 --> 03:20:39,680
regulator's the Newsome administration

4791
03:20:37,010 --> 03:20:42,290
and the legislature as you all know that

4792
03:20:39,680 --> 03:20:44,860
legal cannabis industry vigorously tests

4793
03:20:42,290 --> 03:20:47,270
all of its products the folks who are

4794
03:20:44,860 --> 03:20:50,300
members of CCI a and our part of the

4795
03:20:47,270 --> 03:20:51,890
legal industry have absolutely jumped

4796
03:20:50,299 --> 03:20:53,119
through all of the hoops to be compliant

4797
03:20:51,889 --> 03:20:55,549
and we're absolutely committed to

4798
03:20:53,120 --> 03:20:57,470
working with all of you our biggest fear

4799
03:20:55,549 --> 03:21:00,349
is that if we cut off access to legal

4800
03:20:57,469 --> 03:21:02,329
cannabis the illicit market thrives even

4801
03:21:00,350 --> 03:21:04,430
further which creates more risk to

4802
03:21:02,329 --> 03:21:06,110
public health so we appreciate the

4803
03:21:04,430 --> 03:21:08,210
opportunity to partner with you and be a

4804
03:21:06,110 --> 03:21:13,130
resource and thank you for this

4805
03:21:08,209 --> 03:21:16,459
opportunity thank you hi good afternoon

4806
03:21:13,129 --> 03:21:17,509
chairman gray and chairman wood and

4807
03:21:16,459 --> 03:21:19,728
committee members

4808
03:21:17,510 --> 03:21:22,430
my name is Tiffany debet I work with

4809
03:21:19,728 --> 03:21:24,709
cannon craft I had a bar consumer and

4810
03:21:22,430 --> 03:21:27,260
government affairs we're one of the

4811
03:21:24,709 --> 03:21:30,169
largest manufacturers in the state we've

4812
03:21:27,260 --> 03:21:33,020
done a lot of research on this issue it

4813
03:21:30,170 --> 03:21:35,719
is worth mentioning that California has

4814
03:21:33,020 --> 03:21:38,630
the most rigorous testing standards in

4815
03:21:35,719 --> 03:21:41,299
the country we did some comparative

4816
03:21:38,629 --> 03:21:43,789
testing of other products in California

4817
03:21:41,299 --> 03:21:46,099
and cannabis with regard to pesticides

4818
03:21:43,790 --> 03:21:48,380
is cleaner than chocolate milk it's

4819
03:21:46,100 --> 03:21:52,130
cleaner than wine it's cleaner than baby

4820
03:21:48,379 --> 03:21:54,679
food it looks as though this

4821
03:21:52,129 --> 03:21:58,789
beeping issues an issue with the illicit

4822
03:21:54,680 --> 03:22:01,280
market our message to you is that the

4823
03:21:58,790 --> 03:22:03,620
only way to stop the illnesses and

4824
03:22:01,280 --> 03:22:06,649
deaths that are happening is to help

4825
03:22:03,620 --> 03:22:09,680
consumers migrate from the illicit

4826
03:22:06,648 --> 03:22:11,719
market to the illicit market there are

4827
03:22:09,680 --> 03:22:13,760
three reasons why they're buying in the

4828
03:22:11,719 --> 03:22:15,949
black market they can't tell the

4829
03:22:13,760 --> 03:22:19,790
difference they don't want to pay three

4830
03:22:15,950 --> 03:22:22,970
times as much for the regulated product

4831
03:22:19,790 --> 03:22:25,430
or they don't have access to regulated

4832
03:22:22,969 --> 03:22:29,809
product so our what we had urged you to

4833
03:22:25,430 --> 03:22:31,909
do is to work on passing 1356 to expand

4834
03:22:29,809 --> 03:22:34,639
access to legal well tested well

4835
03:22:31,909 --> 03:22:39,319
regulated cannabis and look at some tax

4836
03:22:34,639 --> 03:22:41,629
reform thank you thank you for this

4837
03:22:39,319 --> 03:22:44,600
hearing my name is Dale Gehringer with

4838
03:22:41,629 --> 03:22:46,839
California normal I sponsored the first

4839
03:22:44,600 --> 03:22:52,030
published studies on cannabis

4840
03:22:46,840 --> 03:22:54,520
vaporization back in 2001 in 2003 which

4841
03:22:52,030 --> 03:22:57,550
demonstrated quite clearly that

4842
03:22:54,520 --> 03:23:02,060
vaporizers were very effective in

4843
03:22:57,549 --> 03:23:05,299
removing the toxins in marijuana smoke

4844
03:23:02,059 --> 03:23:08,478
and were really helpful as a smoke harm

4845
03:23:05,299 --> 03:23:11,420
reduction device since then a marijuana

4846
03:23:08,478 --> 03:23:14,688
vaporizers have come to be accepted as

4847
03:23:11,420 --> 03:23:17,030
the gold standard for administration in

4848
03:23:14,689 --> 03:23:19,550
medical studies however there are

4849
03:23:17,030 --> 03:23:21,189
vaporizers and there are vaporizers

4850
03:23:19,549 --> 03:23:24,139
there's been a lot of innovation

4851
03:23:21,189 --> 03:23:27,139
recently with new kinds of extracts

4852
03:23:24,139 --> 03:23:29,689
possible new chemicals and additives and

4853
03:23:27,139 --> 03:23:32,329
there is an issue about the hardware

4854
03:23:29,689 --> 03:23:35,720
which comes from China from many

4855
03:23:32,329 --> 03:23:40,700
different sources some of them more

4856
03:23:35,719 --> 03:23:42,489
reputable than others so I think we we

4857
03:23:40,700 --> 03:23:48,290
ought to investigate those things

4858
03:23:42,489 --> 03:23:52,789
however I have to i'm i consumers really

4859
03:23:48,290 --> 03:23:56,530
appreciate the availability of tested

4860
03:23:52,790 --> 03:24:00,320
high quality vaporizers on the market

4861
03:23:56,530 --> 03:24:03,500
now in california hope they stay there

4862
03:24:00,319 --> 03:24:04,119
and should a problem ever arise with one

4863
03:24:03,500 --> 03:24:06,398
of those

4864
03:24:04,120 --> 03:24:08,380
at least we'll be able to track it down

4865
03:24:06,398 --> 03:24:09,819
a whole lot better than this stuff

4866
03:24:08,379 --> 03:24:15,009
that's on the illicit market

4867
03:24:09,819 --> 03:24:16,270
Thank You Randa Martin here on behalf of

4868
03:24:15,010 --> 03:24:18,010
kaliba which is one of the largest

4869
03:24:16,270 --> 03:24:20,260
vertically integrated operations in the

4870
03:24:18,010 --> 03:24:22,510
state of California we appreciate the

4871
03:24:20,260 --> 03:24:23,800
emphasis today on enforcement we can

4872
03:24:22,510 --> 03:24:26,409
tell you from the perspective on the

4873
03:24:23,799 --> 03:24:28,209
ground is that enforcement resources may

4874
03:24:26,409 --> 03:24:31,030
be substantial but they are far from

4875
03:24:28,209 --> 03:24:32,529
sufficient we as the stakeholders and

4876
03:24:31,030 --> 03:24:35,200
you as the legislature have worked to

4877
03:24:32,530 --> 03:24:37,120
put more funds into the budget for the

4878
03:24:35,200 --> 03:24:39,909
last couple of years for more resources

4879
03:24:37,120 --> 03:24:42,609
for enforcement that was done in the

4880
03:24:39,909 --> 03:24:44,260
context of making it easier for legal

4881
03:24:42,609 --> 03:24:46,270
operators to continue to operate

4882
03:24:44,260 --> 03:24:50,260
successfully and also to make sure that

4883
03:24:46,270 --> 03:24:52,510
our tax resources were robust as as

4884
03:24:50,260 --> 03:24:54,130
projected but now it's taken a whole new

4885
03:24:52,510 --> 03:24:56,978
complete a kit on a whole new complexion

4886
03:24:54,129 --> 03:24:59,108
with this public health issue we really

4887
03:24:56,978 --> 03:25:01,329
need this coming budget cycle to amp up

4888
03:24:59,109 --> 03:25:03,309
our efforts to get more excuse me more

4889
03:25:01,329 --> 03:25:08,739
money into the budget for enforcement

4890
03:25:03,309 --> 03:25:10,420
purposes thank you hi I'm Ellen comp

4891
03:25:08,739 --> 03:25:13,148
with California normal I have an

4892
03:25:10,420 --> 03:25:14,770
opposite perspective a hundred years of

4893
03:25:13,148 --> 03:25:17,769
punitive actions against marijuana

4894
03:25:14,770 --> 03:25:19,510
sellers hasn't made our state safer the

4895
03:25:17,770 --> 03:25:22,090
only thing that will ever work is proper

4896
03:25:19,510 --> 03:25:24,520
reasonable regulation we thank Laurier

4897
03:25:22,090 --> 03:25:26,530
Jets and the BCC for enacting those

4898
03:25:24,520 --> 03:25:29,319
regulations in California keeping us

4899
03:25:26,530 --> 03:25:30,760
safe we supported the bills mr. Lowe

4900
03:25:29,319 --> 03:25:32,469
mentioned to address the problem of

4901
03:25:30,760 --> 03:25:34,960
two-thirds of California cities and

4902
03:25:32,469 --> 03:25:37,750
counties not licensing cannabis retailer

4903
03:25:34,959 --> 03:25:39,519
delivery to Larry and Kings County where

4904
03:25:37,750 --> 03:25:43,209
we have seen deaths due to this crisis

4905
03:25:39,520 --> 03:25:45,250
have no legal option available mr. gray

4906
03:25:43,209 --> 03:25:47,409
there was no bill to encourage cannabis

4907
03:25:45,250 --> 03:25:49,659
use by passengers in commercial vehicles

4908
03:25:47,409 --> 03:25:52,180
in California that was allowed for in

4909
03:25:49,659 --> 03:25:54,309
Cal in prop 64 as it is in Colorado

4910
03:25:52,180 --> 03:25:56,350
there was a bill to regulate those

4911
03:25:54,309 --> 03:25:59,469
vehicles which was sensationalized in

4912
03:25:56,350 --> 03:26:01,359
the press as allowing it now the

4913
03:25:59,469 --> 03:26:02,920
transportation bill has ensured that the

4914
03:26:01,359 --> 03:26:05,739
exemption for passengers and such

4915
03:26:02,920 --> 03:26:08,590
vehicles applies only to alcohol not

4916
03:26:05,739 --> 03:26:11,199
cannabis excessive alcohol use in

4917
03:26:08,590 --> 03:26:13,930
California is responsible for 10,000

4918
03:26:11,200 --> 03:26:17,770
deaths and 72,000 hospitalizations

4919
03:26:13,930 --> 03:26:20,020
annually the penalty in California

4920
03:26:17,770 --> 03:26:22,869
for illegal sales of firearms as far as

4921
03:26:20,020 --> 03:26:25,420
I can find is a misdemeanor with the one

4922
03:26:22,869 --> 03:26:27,550
thousand dollar fine there are 3500

4923
03:26:25,420 --> 03:26:32,139
deaths due to firearms annually in

4924
03:26:27,549 --> 03:26:33,849

4928
03:26:38,170 --> 03:26:42,219
cannabis workers within the state we're

4929
03:26:40,719 --> 03:26:44,108
committed to ensuring the legal cannabis

4930
03:26:42,219 --> 03:26:46,448
industry continues to put consumer

4931
03:26:44,109 --> 03:26:47,859
safety first strong regulations and

4932
03:26:46,449 --> 03:26:50,260
strong enforcement are critical to

4933
03:26:47,859 --> 03:26:51,460
protecting consumers the California

4934
03:26:50,260 --> 03:26:53,199
Department of Public Health while

4935
03:26:51,459 --> 03:26:54,969
cautioning against vaping until more is

4936
03:26:53,199 --> 03:26:56,470
known about the root of these illnesses

4937
03:26:54,969 --> 03:26:58,929
has been cleared it's advice to

4938
03:26:56,469 --> 03:27:00,908
consumers illegal cannabis dispensaries

4939
03:26:58,930 --> 03:27:02,859
so unregulated and untested cannabis

4940
03:27:00,908 --> 03:27:04,449
products and should not be used one

4941
03:27:02,859 --> 03:27:06,279
thing we do know is that licensed

4942
03:27:04,449 --> 03:27:08,979
cannabis businesses continue to be the

4943
03:27:06,279 --> 03:27:10,510
safest option for consumers no cannabis

4944
03:27:08,978 --> 03:27:12,728
vaping products purchased at legal

4945
03:27:10,510 --> 03:27:15,219
cannabis businesses have been confirmed

4946
03:27:12,728 --> 03:27:17,828
linked to any of the recent health cases

4947
03:27:15,219 --> 03:27:20,019
reported in response to the outbreaks of

4948
03:27:17,828 --> 03:27:22,119
respiratory illness linked to vaping

4949
03:27:20,020 --> 03:27:24,279
it is imperative that California further

4950
03:27:22,119 --> 03:27:26,020
strengthen its enforcement efforts to

4951
03:27:24,279 --> 03:27:28,479
thwart the illicit market by identifying

4952
03:27:26,020 --> 03:27:30,760
closing the estimated 3,000 illegal

4953
03:27:28,478 --> 03:27:32,469
dispensaries operating in the state at

4954
03:27:30,760 --> 03:27:33,969
the same time state officials and

4955
03:27:32,469 --> 03:27:35,709
industry leaders must redouble their

4956
03:27:33,969 --> 03:27:37,389
commitment to ensuring a legal

4957
03:27:35,709 --> 03:27:39,009
marketplace in which consumers can

4958
03:27:37,389 --> 03:27:42,059
purchase cannabis products with

4959
03:27:39,010 --> 03:27:44,590
confidence on their safety thank you

4960
03:27:42,059 --> 03:27:46,448
good afternoon Lyn silver the Public

4961
03:27:44,590 --> 03:27:50,408
Health Institute dr. wood your former

4962
03:27:46,449 --> 03:27:53,890
county health officer how are you I'm

4963
03:27:50,408 --> 03:27:56,350
glad to see this hearing today this is

4964
03:27:53,889 --> 03:27:58,840
not just an issue of legal versus

4965
03:27:56,350 --> 03:28:02,199
illegal products this is a much deeper

4966
03:27:58,840 --> 03:28:03,908
problem if there is no single cause we

4967
03:28:02,199 --> 03:28:06,789
need to look at the forces that are

4968
03:28:03,908 --> 03:28:09,279
driving addiction initiation and heavy

4969
03:28:06,789 --> 03:28:11,680
use and thereby exposing people to

4970
03:28:09,279 --> 03:28:13,810
whatever hazards may be causing this

4971
03:28:11,680 --> 03:28:16,750
epidemic but also the many other more

4972
03:28:13,809 --> 03:28:18,639
serious health consequences well not

4973
03:28:16,750 --> 03:28:20,799
more serious than death obviously this

4974
03:28:18,639 --> 03:28:23,799
week for example I purchase stills e

4975
03:28:20,799 --> 03:28:25,828
granddaddy purp ass link a sleek pink

4976
03:28:23,799 --> 03:28:28,238
vaping device which I'll give you guys

4977
03:28:25,828 --> 03:28:31,149
resembling a memory stick with grape

4978
03:28:28,238 --> 03:28:35,310
flavor 78% THC

4979
03:28:31,149 --> 03:28:39,279
or 393 milligrams four times the maximum

4980
03:28:35,310 --> 03:28:42,909
THC dose for edible packages forty times

4981
03:28:39,280 --> 03:28:47,500
the maximum Canadian edible packages the

4982
03:28:42,909 --> 03:28:51,101
equivalent of 30 1990 joints furthermore

4983
03:28:47,500 --> 03:28:54,880
in just 0.02 ounces it is an invitation

4984
03:28:51,101 --> 03:28:57,159
to youth addiction legally marketed in

4985
03:28:54,880 --> 03:28:59,229
the state of California furthermore

4986
03:28:57,159 --> 03:29:01,750
recent studies demonstrate a five-fold

4987
03:28:59,229 --> 03:29:03,970
increase in psychosis risk with daily

4988
03:29:01,750 --> 03:29:07,030
use of cannabis products over ten

4989
03:29:03,970 --> 03:29:09,310
percent THC which is almost the entire

4990
03:29:07,030 --> 03:29:13,440
California regulated legal or illegal

4991
03:29:09,310 --> 03:29:16,029
market we need to address these issues

4992
03:29:13,440 --> 03:29:17,500
to successfully reverse both this

4993
03:29:16,030 --> 03:29:20,230
epidemic and negative health

4994
03:29:17,500 --> 03:29:22,120
consequences from cannabis I want to

4995
03:29:20,229 --> 03:29:23,829
make a couple of a few just very

4996
03:29:22,120 --> 03:29:26,829
concrete recommendations that I can

4997
03:29:23,829 --> 03:29:29,739
leave a written set of comments with you

4998
03:29:26,829 --> 03:29:31,390
we call for urgent common-sense action

4999
03:29:29,739 --> 03:29:33,880
from the state legislature and state

5000
03:29:31,390 --> 03:29:36,579
agencies to prevent even more serious

5001
03:29:33,880 --> 03:29:39,489
consequences first close the kitty

5002
03:29:36,579 --> 03:29:40,989
on-ramp of flavored products and sounds

5003
03:29:39,489 --> 03:29:43,601
like flavored products like the one

5004
03:29:40,989 --> 03:29:45,909
Assemblymember gray cited the banana the

5005
03:29:43,601 --> 03:29:47,620
this and that that may not be flavored

5006
03:29:45,909 --> 03:29:50,459
but certainly sound to a kid like they

5007
03:29:47,620 --> 03:29:53,230
are both for nicotine and for cannabis

5008
03:29:50,459 --> 03:29:54,880
second build on San Francisco and

5009
03:29:53,229 --> 03:29:57,459
Richmond's courageous initiatives and

5010
03:29:54,880 --> 03:29:59,979
suspends sales of vaping products a

5011
03:29:57,459 --> 03:30:04,180
until the e-cigarette industry proves

5012
03:29:59,979 --> 03:30:06,399
their safety to the FDA and for the case

5013
03:30:04,181 --> 03:30:09,159
of cannabis until we understand what is

5014
03:30:06,399 --> 03:30:11,109
going on with the vaping epidemic third

5015
03:30:09,159 --> 03:30:13,899
interrupt the addiction glidepath

5016
03:30:11,110 --> 03:30:16,329
created by products like this by

5017
03:30:13,899 --> 03:30:19,091
limiting the potency of THC products

5018
03:30:16,329 --> 03:30:21,601
allowed this will reduce youth addiction

5019
03:30:19,091 --> 03:30:24,220
to vaping lung disease psychosis

5020
03:30:21,601 --> 03:30:25,989
secondary to cannabis would Agua and

5021
03:30:24,220 --> 03:30:29,529
Quebec for example have already done

5022
03:30:25,989 --> 03:30:32,199
this fourth tell people the truth we

5023
03:30:29,530 --> 03:30:35,051
only have warnings in six point font on

5024
03:30:32,200 --> 03:30:37,301
packages today we need to have clear

5025
03:30:35,050 --> 03:30:41,289
prominent health warnings to consumers

5026
03:30:37,300 --> 03:30:43,329
in stores on products and on ads making

5027
03:30:41,290 --> 03:30:45,130
clear the recognized health risks from

5028
03:30:43,329 --> 03:30:47,709
cannabis including a dick

5029
03:30:45,129 --> 03:30:51,159
in low birthweight beeping the vaping

5030
03:30:47,709 --> 03:30:53,409
epidemic psychosis and so forth fifth

5031
03:30:51,159 --> 03:30:56,079
limit the marketing that kids and teens

5032
03:30:53,409 --> 03:30:57,939
are seeing every day for example even

5033
03:30:56,079 --> 03:31:00,670
the restriction on billboards that was

5034
03:30:57,939 --> 03:31:03,010
part of prop 64 was weakened by the

5035
03:31:00,670 --> 03:31:04,930
December regulations allowing some of

5036
03:31:03,010 --> 03:31:06,040
the spate of billboards were seeing all

5037
03:31:04,930 --> 03:31:09,130
across the state

5038
03:31:06,040 --> 03:31:11,500
do not allow marketing in restaurants

5039
03:31:09,129 --> 03:31:14,500
alcohol stores and other places where

5040
03:31:11,500 --> 03:31:16,510
kids go we bought a coffee cup in I

5041
03:31:14,500 --> 03:31:18,549
think was pizza or Starbucks that we

5042
03:31:16,510 --> 03:31:21,880
could go with a chill banner on the

5043
03:31:18,549 --> 03:31:24,369
coffee cup for example and establish a

5044
03:31:21,879 --> 03:31:26,799
scientific advisory board for cannabis

5045
03:31:24,370 --> 03:31:29,740
regulation that is free of conflicts of

5046
03:31:26,799 --> 03:31:32,259
interest that is essential to help guide

5047
03:31:29,739 --> 03:31:34,799
these processes with exemption the time

5048
03:31:32,260 --> 03:31:36,728
for action is now thank you very much

5049
03:31:34,799 --> 03:31:39,219

5050
03:31:36,728 --> 03:31:43,869
remind everybody we just experienced two

5051
03:31:39,219 --> 03:31:45,250
very long one-minute comments I actually

5052
03:31:43,870 --> 03:31:46,570
the committee's generally interested in

5053
03:31:45,250 --> 03:31:48,398
what you have to say to the degree to

5054
03:31:46,569 --> 03:31:50,799
which you could confine your comments to

5055
03:31:48,398 --> 03:31:52,539
a minute and then provide any written

5056
03:31:50,799 --> 03:31:54,188
testimony questions that Center to the

5057
03:31:52,540 --> 03:31:57,070
committee will certainly make sure

5058
03:31:54,189 --> 03:31:58,689
everybody sees us proceed good afternoon

5059
03:31:57,069 --> 03:32:01,209
chairman and members of the committee

5060
03:31:58,689 --> 03:32:02,950
Andres Ramirez on behalf of select moxie

5061
03:32:01,209 --> 03:32:04,719
and Cresco I want to thank you for

5062
03:32:02,950 --> 03:32:05,979
calling this informational hearing to

5063
03:32:04,719 --> 03:32:08,049
discuss this important topic

5064
03:32:05,978 --> 03:32:09,789
and thank the committee staff for all

5065
03:32:08,049 --> 03:32:12,069
their work through the leadership of

5066
03:32:09,790 --> 03:32:14,410
Cameron Forney the CEO of select we've

5067
03:32:12,069 --> 03:32:17,110
helped build a large coalition of 25

5068
03:32:14,409 --> 03:32:18,819
plus cannabis industry businesses to

5069
03:32:17,110 --> 03:32:21,370
come together and recommend five pillars

5070
03:32:18,819 --> 03:32:23,319
now we strongly believe would lead to an

5071
03:32:21,370 --> 03:32:25,510
effective and immediate impact on

5072
03:32:23,319 --> 03:32:27,069
illicit vaping products we've shared our

5073
03:32:25,510 --> 03:32:28,989
coalition recommendations with committee

5074
03:32:27,069 --> 03:32:31,510
staff and the five pillars include

5075
03:32:28,989 --> 03:32:34,030
addressing the illicit market enhancing

5076
03:32:31,510 --> 03:32:36,280
testing regulations certifying hardware

5077
03:32:34,030 --> 03:32:39,670
and facilities anti-counterfeiting

5078
03:32:36,280 --> 03:32:40,960
efforts and certified shipping we've had

5079
03:32:39,670 --> 03:32:42,700
many discussions and meetings with

5080
03:32:40,959 --> 03:32:45,129
governor Newsome's administration as

5081
03:32:42,700 --> 03:32:46,600
well as cannabis regulators and we

5082
03:32:45,129 --> 03:32:48,579
greatly appreciate their effort and

5083
03:32:46,600 --> 03:32:51,250
interest to work with us and discuss our

5084
03:32:48,579 --> 03:32:52,329
recommendations we're excited to partner

5085
03:32:51,250 --> 03:32:55,299
and work with the legislature

5086
03:32:52,329 --> 03:32:57,549
specifically your committees to ensure

5087
03:32:55,299 --> 03:32:58,600
that youth vaping epidemic is not only

5088
03:32:57,549 --> 03:33:00,399
reduced

5089
03:32:58,601 --> 03:33:02,141
that strong effective enforcement is

5090
03:33:00,399 --> 03:33:03,341
directed at eradicating illegal and

5091
03:33:02,140 --> 03:33:07,501
counterfeit vaping products in

5092
03:33:03,341 --> 03:33:09,461
California thank you thank you very much

5093
03:33:07,501 --> 03:33:10,751
thank you very much for the committee

5094
03:33:09,460 --> 03:33:12,970
for community today and having this

5095
03:33:10,751 --> 03:33:14,229
hearing if there's one message I would

5096
03:33:12,970 --> 03:33:17,020
like the committee to take away from

5097
03:33:14,229 --> 03:33:18,970
this is three words bans don't work my

5098
03:33:17,021 --> 03:33:21,011
name is Luis Hahn I'm a California

5099
03:33:18,970 --> 03:33:22,479
native and I have vetted thousands of

5100
03:33:21,011 --> 03:33:24,610
cannabis companies for the ArcView group

5101
03:33:22,479 --> 03:33:25,899
a nine year old investor network that

5102
03:33:24,610 --> 03:33:28,211
has invested more than two hundred and

5103
03:33:25,899 --> 03:33:31,300
sixty million dollars into the cannabis

5104
03:33:28,210 --> 03:33:32,939
industry a moratorium on all cannabis

5105
03:33:31,300 --> 03:33:35,050
vaping is not the answer

5106
03:33:32,940 --> 03:33:36,551
despite years of cannabis vaping

5107
03:33:35,050 --> 03:33:38,529
products being on the market we are only

5108
03:33:36,550 --> 03:33:40,091
hearing about these issues now this is

5109
03:33:38,530 --> 03:33:42,131
because this is a death rattle of

5110
03:33:40,091 --> 03:33:44,229
illegitimate producers who are using

5111
03:33:42,130 --> 03:33:45,850
fast and cheap methods in order to cling

5112
03:33:44,229 --> 03:33:48,790
on to the market share that they have

5113
03:33:45,851 --> 03:33:50,319
left a ban on cannabis vaping is the

5114
03:33:48,790 --> 03:33:52,149
exact response that they are looking for

5115
03:33:50,319 --> 03:33:53,710
because that will shut down their

5116
03:33:52,149 --> 03:33:56,319
legitimate competitors while allowing

5117
03:33:53,710 --> 03:33:57,790
them to continue to thrive bans will

5118
03:33:56,319 --> 03:34:00,011
only perpetuate this public health

5119
03:33:57,790 --> 03:34:01,960
crisis instead we should invest more

5120
03:34:00,011 --> 03:34:04,239
resources into enforcement and research

5121
03:34:01,960 --> 03:34:06,340
so I encourage our legislature to

5122
03:34:04,239 --> 03:34:07,989
consider these alternatives bans didn't

5123
03:34:06,341 --> 03:34:09,431
work for prohibition it didn't work for

5124
03:34:07,989 --> 03:34:13,569
the war on drugs and it won't work now

5125
03:34:09,431 --> 03:34:14,501
thank you thank you chair members Kathy

5126
03:34:13,569 --> 03:34:16,331
Mossberg with the American Heart

5127
03:34:14,501 --> 03:34:18,041
Association again like everyone want to

5128
03:34:16,331 --> 03:34:19,569
thank you for this hearing today want to

5129
03:34:18,040 --> 03:34:22,000
underscore some comments from the first

5130
03:34:19,569 --> 03:34:24,040
panel and talk about the epidemic we're

5131
03:34:22,001 --> 03:34:26,200
seeing in teen vaping we have been the

5132
03:34:24,040 --> 03:34:28,449
sponsors along with a number of public

5133
03:34:26,200 --> 03:34:30,851
health advocates in encouraging this

5134
03:34:28,450 --> 03:34:33,311
legislature and we hope to work with the

5135
03:34:30,851 --> 03:34:35,711
governor's office in banning sorry not

5136
03:34:33,310 --> 03:34:38,140
my best following the last gentleman but

5137
03:34:35,710 --> 03:34:40,840
banning the use or the sale of all

5138
03:34:38,140 --> 03:34:42,729
flavored ecig and and combustible

5139
03:34:40,841 --> 03:34:44,140
tobacco products we think this is the

5140
03:34:42,729 --> 03:34:46,479
way to go certainly we heard the

5141
03:34:44,140 --> 03:34:48,460
testimony that up into a point that the

5142
03:34:46,479 --> 03:34:51,520
ban has worked we have seen a decrease

5143
03:34:48,460 --> 03:34:53,680
in teen and youth use but that we left

5144
03:34:51,521 --> 03:34:55,331
out menthol so we do think that menthol

5145
03:34:53,681 --> 03:34:56,890
and mint need to be a part of this band

5146
03:34:55,331 --> 03:34:58,751
so we encourage we want to work with the

5147
03:34:56,890 --> 03:35:01,029
legislature these committees and we

5148
03:34:58,751 --> 03:35:02,700
encourage you to work on that this next

5149
03:35:01,030 --> 03:35:05,771
upcoming session thank you

5150
03:35:02,700 --> 03:35:08,840
just to clarify your comments there did

5151
03:35:05,771 --> 03:35:12,561
you include you said a band

5152
03:35:08,840 --> 03:35:15,290
THC and tobacco we have not we do not

5153
03:35:12,560 --> 03:35:16,760
have a position on cannabis at this

5154
03:35:15,290 --> 03:35:18,470
point we are looking into that but that

5155
03:35:16,760 --> 03:35:21,110
is an area that we haven't looked at

5156
03:35:18,469 --> 03:35:23,270
before we have been focused on on vaping

5157
03:35:21,110 --> 03:35:26,110
and e-cigs as well as men of

5158
03:35:23,271 --> 03:35:28,640
combustibles okay thank you

5159
03:35:26,110 --> 03:35:29,960
good afternoon Darya makrooh on behalf

5160
03:35:28,639 --> 03:35:32,629
of the California Dental Association

5161
03:35:29,959 --> 03:35:35,149
thank you for the attention there's

5162
03:35:32,629 --> 03:35:39,079
clearly several complex issues at play

5163
03:35:35,149 --> 03:35:41,569
here separating out the discussion of

5164
03:35:39,079 --> 03:35:45,351
flavors and the discussion of cannabis

5165
03:35:41,569 --> 03:35:47,149
and the some of the issues that could be

5166
03:35:45,351 --> 03:35:50,450
used to address the vaping related

5167
03:35:47,149 --> 03:35:52,100
illness CDA is supportive of multi prong

5168
03:35:50,450 --> 03:35:56,061
approaches that address all of these

5169
03:35:52,101 --> 03:35:59,440
through separate policy issues including

5170
03:35:56,060 --> 03:36:02,119
a ban on flavors thank you thank you

5171
03:35:59,440 --> 03:36:04,220
good afternoon Laura del Castillo with

5172
03:36:02,120 --> 03:36:06,290
Eden enterprises which is a fully

5173
03:36:04,219 --> 03:36:08,929
licensed vertically integrated cannabis

5174
03:36:06,290 --> 03:36:11,120
company that includes manufacturing vape

5175
03:36:08,930 --> 03:36:13,280
products which are rigorously tested as

5176
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:14,930
you've heard today I would just like to

5177
03:36:13,280 --> 03:36:17,930
echo some of the comments I've been

5178
03:36:14,930 --> 03:36:20,000
hearing which is that yes the public

5179
03:36:17,930 --> 03:36:22,430
health issue is very important and

5180
03:36:20,000 --> 03:36:25,690
should be addressed in a smart and

5181
03:36:22,430 --> 03:36:28,579
effective way

5182
03:36:25,690 --> 03:36:31,819
not with reactionary bans but with

5183
03:36:28,579 --> 03:36:33,620
thorough research public education and

5184
03:36:31,819 --> 03:36:36,649
really getting to the root of the

5185
03:36:33,620 --> 03:36:38,390
problem which we've heard is directly

5186
03:36:36,649 --> 03:36:40,369
connected to the illicit market created

5187
03:36:38,389 --> 03:36:43,159
through prohibition and lack of

5188
03:36:40,370 --> 03:36:44,780
enforcement that being said and I agree

5189
03:36:43,159 --> 03:36:47,149
with others that this issue is being

5190
03:36:44,780 --> 03:36:49,280
somewhat conflated with the youth vaping

5191
03:36:47,149 --> 03:36:52,039
and the attractive flavors but if the

5192
03:36:49,280 --> 03:36:55,340
state and other local municipalities are

5193
03:36:52,040 --> 03:36:57,021
considering a flavor ban I would that

5194
03:36:55,340 --> 03:36:59,870
would extend to cannabis I would

5195
03:36:57,021 --> 03:37:02,030
encourage you to carefully consider and

5196
03:36:59,870 --> 03:37:04,730
make clear the definition of flavor

5197
03:37:02,030 --> 03:37:06,620
which should focus on artificial flavors

5198
03:37:04,729 --> 03:37:11,899
rather than naturally-occurring terpenes

5199
03:37:06,620 --> 03:37:13,550
thank you thank you hello Alicia Priya

5200
03:37:11,899 --> 03:37:16,010
go on behalf of the California cannabis

5201
03:37:13,549 --> 03:37:18,649
Manufacturers Association we also stand

5202
03:37:16,010 --> 03:37:20,351
ready to work with and be a resource for

5203
03:37:18,649 --> 03:37:23,619
the legislature and the

5204
03:37:20,351 --> 03:37:25,721
regulatory agencies as covered

5205
03:37:23,620 --> 03:37:28,601
exhaustively today this is a youth and

5206
03:37:25,720 --> 03:37:30,489
illicit market issue we are also looking

5207
03:37:28,601 --> 03:37:33,211
at best practices and have seen in

5208
03:37:30,489 --> 03:37:35,790
Europe that they have a very vigorous

5209
03:37:33,210 --> 03:37:38,560
education effort on the use of vaping

5210
03:37:35,790 --> 03:37:40,331
devices and hardware and also limit

5211
03:37:38,560 --> 03:37:42,699
nicotine content and other ingredients

5212
03:37:40,331 --> 03:37:43,960
inside the devices and notably do not

5213
03:37:42,700 --> 03:37:47,171
have the same issues that we're

5214
03:37:43,960 --> 03:37:48,939
experiencing here and lastly the notable

5215
03:37:47,171 --> 03:37:51,130
absence of reports and in cases arising

5216
03:37:48,940 --> 03:37:52,751
from legal regulated outlets speaks

5217
03:37:51,130 --> 03:37:54,671
strongly to the effectiveness of

5218
03:37:52,751 --> 03:37:58,091
controlled access and regulation thank

5219
03:37:54,671 --> 03:38:00,640
you thank you good afternoon chairman

5220
03:37:58,091 --> 03:38:03,041
gray chairman would Aimee Jenkins here

5221
03:38:00,640 --> 03:38:04,720
on behalf of to cannabis operators bloom

5222
03:38:03,040 --> 03:38:06,600
farms and Sunday Goods both

5223
03:38:04,720 --> 03:38:09,790
manufacturers of inhalable products

5224
03:38:06,601 --> 03:38:11,200
licensed compliant entities that are

5225
03:38:09,790 --> 03:38:12,729
subject to all the rigorous testing

5226
03:38:11,200 --> 03:38:14,980
standards and I want to echo the

5227
03:38:12,729 --> 03:38:17,081
comments made by cata craftsy CIA and

5228
03:38:14,979 --> 03:38:19,540
ArcView bands just simply will not work

5229
03:38:17,081 --> 03:38:21,310
in this situation and the linkages with

5230
03:38:19,540 --> 03:38:24,460
compliant products is just simply not

5231
03:38:21,310 --> 03:38:26,380
there at this point in time both bloom

5232
03:38:24,460 --> 03:38:27,819
Farms and Sunday Goods is committed to

5233
03:38:26,380 --> 03:38:30,040
continuing to partner with this

5234
03:38:27,819 --> 03:38:33,520
legislature and our associations I've

5235
03:38:30,040 --> 03:38:35,619
never seen so many groups coalescing and

5236
03:38:33,521 --> 03:38:37,239
working together to try to resolve this

5237
03:38:35,620 --> 03:38:39,940
issue we want to continue to be partners

5238
03:38:37,239 --> 03:38:41,470
a couple last minute comments illicit

5239
03:38:39,940 --> 03:38:42,971
market and we need more enforcement

5240
03:38:41,470 --> 03:38:45,600
dollars and we've been trying to

5241
03:38:42,970 --> 03:38:48,399
champion that access continues to be a

5242
03:38:45,601 --> 03:38:50,081
significant issue as you know and then

5243
03:38:48,399 --> 03:38:51,970
adopting some anti-counterfeiting

5244
03:38:50,081 --> 03:38:56,409
measures would certainly be critically

5245
03:38:51,970 --> 03:38:59,380
important thank you thank you good

5246
03:38:56,409 --> 03:39:01,300
afternoon Michael wheeler I'm the vice

5247
03:38:59,380 --> 03:39:04,001
president of policy with flow kana and

5248
03:39:01,300 --> 03:39:05,380
we're a cannabis distributor thank you

5249
03:39:04,001 --> 03:39:07,511
so much for taking time today with this

5250
03:39:05,380 --> 03:39:10,060
hearing obviously a very complicated

5251
03:39:07,511 --> 03:39:12,970
issue I ask o many of my peers with

5252
03:39:10,060 --> 03:39:14,619
regards to their remarks around the

5253
03:39:12,970 --> 03:39:17,140
usefulness and effectiveness of bans and

5254
03:39:14,620 --> 03:39:18,820
prohibition they don't work I think

5255
03:39:17,140 --> 03:39:22,449
we've talked a lot about the importance

5256
03:39:18,819 --> 03:39:24,251
of how how we encourage use of the

5257
03:39:22,450 --> 03:39:26,681
regulated market through reducing

5258
03:39:24,251 --> 03:39:28,960
taxation and increasing access to a

5259
03:39:26,681 --> 03:39:31,511
legal regulated product however what I

5260
03:39:28,960 --> 03:39:33,969
wanted to add to the comments today were

5261
03:39:31,511 --> 03:39:35,800
that I've got three kids at home

5262
03:39:33,969 --> 03:39:38,139
young they're not exposed to this yet

5263
03:39:35,799 --> 03:39:39,459
but I'm very concerned about it I'm very

5264
03:39:38,139 --> 03:39:42,039
concerned about teen vaping and

5265
03:39:39,459 --> 03:39:45,488
absolutely positively you know we stand

5266
03:39:42,040 --> 03:39:47,620
at your side in working in any way to to

5267
03:39:45,488 --> 03:39:49,420
stamp out teen vaping this is a horrible

5268
03:39:47,620 --> 03:39:50,649
epidemic I would encourage you what I

5269
03:39:49,420 --> 03:39:52,809
didn't hear any of the panelists talk

5270
03:39:50,648 --> 03:39:54,879
about today was some of the factors that

5271
03:39:52,809 --> 03:39:57,939
add to the coolness so when you get a

5272
03:39:54,879 --> 03:40:01,209
chance to take a look at YouTube go look

5273
03:39:57,939 --> 03:40:02,979
at teen they are vape tricks anything

5274
03:40:01,209 --> 03:40:05,438
having to do with vape tricks on YouTube

5275
03:40:02,978 --> 03:40:07,750
it's amazing it's really cool you'll be

5276
03:40:05,439 --> 03:40:10,090
your job will drop and this is part of

5277
03:40:07,750 --> 03:40:13,420
what makes it cool kids sit around all

5278
03:40:10,090 --> 03:40:15,760
day sucking on their on their vape pen

5279
03:40:13,420 --> 03:40:17,889
doing these tricks over and over again

5280
03:40:15,760 --> 03:40:20,079
it's practice practice makes perfect but

5281
03:40:17,889 --> 03:40:21,909
it's adding to the use of these products

5282
03:40:20,079 --> 03:40:26,620
so I just don't know another another

5283
03:40:21,909 --> 03:40:27,068
data point for all of this Thanks good

5284
03:40:26,620 --> 03:40:30,100
afternoon

5285
03:40:27,068 --> 03:40:31,869
Pamela Lopez with K Street consulting on

5286
03:40:30,100 --> 03:40:33,880
behalf of the Silicon Valley cannabis

5287
03:40:31,870 --> 03:40:37,239
Alliance cannabis is medicine

5288
03:40:33,879 --> 03:40:39,849
and licensed and regulated folks in the

5289
03:40:37,238 --> 03:40:41,469
cannabis industry are absolute partners

5290
03:40:39,850 --> 03:40:44,079
in working with you to get to the heart

5291
03:40:41,469 --> 03:40:46,959
of this crisis we would urge you to

5292
03:40:44,079 --> 03:40:49,420
remember that access to cannabis is an

5293
03:40:46,959 --> 03:40:51,639
important way to help consumers get away

5294
03:40:49,420 --> 03:40:53,859
from the black market illicit products

5295
03:40:51,639 --> 03:40:56,738
that are making them sick if I recall

5296
03:40:53,859 --> 03:40:58,238
correctly to date only 600 licensed

5297
03:40:56,738 --> 03:40:59,219
retailers exist in the state of

5298
03:40:58,238 --> 03:41:03,609
California

5299
03:40:59,219 --> 03:41:06,760
275 licensed non storefront distributors

5300
03:41:03,609 --> 03:41:10,029
that's down from 3,000 storefronts that

5301
03:41:06,760 --> 03:41:12,370
were open before the passage of Prop 64

5302
03:41:10,029 --> 03:41:14,950
and before cannabis was licensed and

5303
03:41:12,370 --> 03:41:16,689
regulated so there will always be bad

5304
03:41:14,950 --> 03:41:18,159
guys who are trying to sell illicit

5305
03:41:16,689 --> 03:41:20,260
stuff on the black market to make a

5306
03:41:18,159 --> 03:41:21,398
quick buck but it's our job in the state

5307
03:41:20,260 --> 03:41:24,279
of California to make sure that

5308
03:41:21,398 --> 03:41:28,869
consumers have access to products that

5309
03:41:24,279 --> 03:41:30,760
they know are licensed and safe hi

5310
03:41:28,870 --> 03:41:32,560
Sabrina pendrick with Berkeley patients

5311
03:41:30,760 --> 03:41:34,180
group and just to reiterate what some of

5312
03:41:32,559 --> 03:41:35,680
the other people have said we our

5313
03:41:34,180 --> 03:41:37,988
country and our state have gone through

5314
03:41:35,680 --> 03:41:39,370
multiple iterations of prohibition every

5315
03:41:37,988 --> 03:41:41,738
single time we've realized that it

5316
03:41:39,370 --> 03:41:44,140
doesn't work that was the whole point of

5317
03:41:41,738 --> 03:41:46,270
prop 64 however when you have two-thirds

5318
03:41:44,139 --> 03:41:48,528
of the state that are banning retail

5319
03:41:46,270 --> 03:41:51,890
sales it shouldn't be a surprise to

5320
03:41:48,529 --> 03:41:54,379
that were seeing the bathtub gin of 2019

5321
03:41:51,889 --> 03:41:58,458
happening or the k2 spice of 2019

5322
03:41:54,379 --> 03:42:00,739
happening I would also know it's

5323
03:41:58,459 --> 03:42:02,629
important when talking about flavors to

5324
03:42:00,738 --> 03:42:05,898
consider the genesis of the flavor it

5325
03:42:02,629 --> 03:42:07,819
was mentioned before and the difference

5326
03:42:05,898 --> 03:42:11,538
between naturally occurring flavors and

5327
03:42:07,818 --> 03:42:13,128
artificial flavors and also I wanted to

5328
03:42:11,539 --> 03:42:15,260
bring to your attention if and nobody

5329
03:42:13,129 --> 03:42:18,590
has mentioned today is looking at the

5330
03:42:15,260 --> 03:42:22,219
data in the UK and in Europe and this is

5331
03:42:18,590 --> 03:42:23,748
a very uniquely American crisis um the

5332
03:42:22,219 --> 03:42:27,528
United Kingdom has one of the lowest

5333
03:42:23,748 --> 03:42:30,228
youth use rates and actually subsidizes

5334
03:42:27,529 --> 03:42:32,479
vape smoking and promotes it as smoking

5335
03:42:30,228 --> 03:42:34,248
sensation policy and there should we

5336
03:42:32,478 --> 03:42:36,679
should ask the question as to why why is

5337
03:42:34,248 --> 03:42:38,949
there a disconnect between you know

5338
03:42:36,680 --> 03:42:41,600
evidence-based Public Policy and

5339
03:42:38,949 --> 03:42:43,699
emotionally-driven prohibitive policies

5340
03:42:41,600 --> 03:42:47,738
that are uniquely American that we need

5341
03:42:43,699 --> 03:42:50,510
to look away from thank you thank you

5342
03:42:47,738 --> 03:42:52,908

5345
03:42:54,799 --> 03:42:59,118
on this issue and we just simply want to

5346
03:42:57,318 --> 03:43:01,158
emphasize the importance of including

5347
03:42:59,119 --> 03:43:03,859
flavors in the conversation particularly

5348
03:43:01,158 --> 03:43:05,208
mint and menthol again very much

5349
03:43:03,859 --> 03:43:06,498

regulated cannabis industry eight years

03:43:36,529 --> 03:43:40,550
ago as a Crohn's disease sufferer and

5363
03:43:38,238 --> 03:43:42,020
doctoral student cannabis saved my life

5364
03:43:40,549 --> 03:43:43,340
then and still provides me with

5365
03:43:42,020 --> 03:43:45,918
life-changing symptom relief

5366
03:43:43,340 --> 03:43:47,898
particularly when vaporized as a patient

scholar and industry member please hear

5368
03:43:47,898 --> 03:43:51,139
me that rash action on this topic may

5369
03:43:49,699 --> 03:43:53,810
have disasters fallout

5370
03:43:51,139 --> 03:43:55,519
since first hearing of recent medicinal

5371
03:43:53,809 --> 03:43:56,868
concern over vaporizer products pure

5372
03:43:55,520 --> 03:43:59,238
extracts began intensive research

5373
03:43:56,869 --> 03:44:00,319
supplemental laboratory testing and made

5374
03:43:59,238 --> 03:44:02,208
pointed requests of our

5375
03:44:00,318 --> 03:44:04,368
cannabis vendors terpene suppliers and

5376

03:44:09,680 --> 03:44:13,850
particularly focusing on cutting agents

5381
03:44:12,199 --> 03:44:16,069
use within the illicit market though

5382
03:44:13,850 --> 03:44:17,838
including vitamin E acetate we strongly

5383
03:44:16,068 --> 03:44:20,628
support additional laboratory testing

5384
03:44:17,838 --> 03:44:21,978
and consumer warning requirements we

5385
03:44:20,629 --> 03:44:23,989
will never ignore the well-being of our

5386
03:44:21,978 --> 03:44:25,639
consumers we are also sincerely

5387
03:44:23,988 --> 03:44:27,559
concerned though about the lively our

5388
03:44:25,639 --> 03:44:29,628
livelihoods and the medicinal needs of

5389
03:44:27,559 --> 03:44:31,850
our thousands of consumers please

5390
03:44:29,629 --> 03:44:34,819
collaborate with our industry to address

5391
03:44:31,850 --> 03:44:38,359
this issue and with an evidence-based

5392
03:44:34,818 --> 03:44:40,878
manner that provides an ongoing access

5393
03:44:38,359 --> 03:44:51,949
to a non combusted inhalable cannabis

5394
03:44:40,879 --> 03:44:54,739
option thank you hi my name is John with

5395
03:44:51,949 --> 03:44:58,069
weed herb I'm speaking on the illicit

5396
03:44:54,738 --> 03:45:00,109
market the lack of enforcement annulus

5397
03:44:58,068 --> 03:45:03,469
market is not really the problem it is

5398
03:45:00,109 --> 03:45:05,270
the lack of Licensing in the city so

5399
03:45:03,469 --> 03:45:07,908
many of us were in the illicit market

5400
03:45:05,270 --> 03:45:09,588
and a lot of these companies forget the

5401
03:45:07,908 --> 03:45:11,328
major companies forget that they were in

5402
03:45:09,588 --> 03:45:13,520
illicit market at one point in time and

5403
03:45:11,328 --> 03:45:14,988
how did they get the money in order to

5404
03:45:13,520 --> 03:45:17,359
get the license that they do have now

5405
03:45:14,988 --> 03:45:19,520
I've been struggling for the last three

5406
03:45:17,359 --> 03:45:22,459
years in order to get licensing in the

5407
03:45:19,520 --> 03:45:24,289
industry and nobody has been able to

5408
03:45:22,459 --> 03:45:27,229
give it to me so I've been doing the

5409
03:45:24,289 --> 03:45:30,050
best that I can in order to try to you

5410
03:45:27,228 --> 03:45:33,498
know get the correct information to get

5411
03:45:30,049 --> 03:45:36,049
in the industry so for a lot of us in

5412
03:45:33,498 --> 03:45:38,148
illicit market we are definitely trying

5413
03:45:36,049 --> 03:45:41,118
our best we have families we take care

5414
03:45:38,148 --> 03:45:43,760
of business and so forth but it's kind

5415
03:45:41,119 --> 03:45:48,529
of hard when you have people that are in

5416
03:45:43,760 --> 03:45:52,219
power that control the narrative thank

5417
03:45:48,529 --> 03:45:54,680
you good afternoon my name is Anne

5418
03:45:52,219 --> 03:45:56,958
delcor I chair the anti vaping Alliance

5419
03:45:54,680 --> 03:45:59,689
at Rio americano high school today I

5420
03:45:56,959 --> 03:46:02,439
brought props this is months worth of

5421
03:45:59,689 --> 03:46:06,260
confiscated devices from the high school

5422
03:46:02,439 --> 03:46:08,680
I take them just about everywhere I go

5423
03:46:06,260 --> 03:46:12,228
because I find that they are the best

5424
03:46:08,680 --> 03:46:13,021
educational tool that we have in this

5425
03:46:12,228 --> 03:46:15,899
fight

5426
03:46:13,021 --> 03:46:18,659
so it's a variety of nicotine and

5427
03:46:15,899 --> 03:46:22,350
marijuana devices and as we heard today

5428
03:46:18,659 --> 03:46:27,869
the students are vaping these devices

5429
03:46:22,351 --> 03:46:29,010
interchangeably I am asking that we do

5430
03:46:27,870 --> 03:46:30,990
something urgently

5431
03:46:29,010 --> 03:46:35,521
I think waiting until the next

5432
03:46:30,989 --> 03:46:38,340
legislative session delays this and we

5433
03:46:35,521 --> 03:46:41,311
are seating students and families truly

5434
03:46:38,340 --> 03:46:43,021
suffering with addiction already they're

5435
03:46:41,310 --> 03:46:46,079
spending a lot of money on addiction

5436
03:46:43,021 --> 03:46:48,800
counselors teachers and administrators

5437
03:46:46,079 --> 03:46:51,510
are having a very difficult time

5438
03:46:48,799 --> 03:46:53,939
educating our kids because of this

5439
03:46:51,510 --> 03:46:56,700
distraction and the schools need more

5440
03:46:53,940 --> 03:46:59,040
help so I ask you for attention to the

5441
03:46:56,700 --> 03:47:01,351
schools either additional personnel or

5442
03:46:59,040 --> 03:47:07,740
additional help at the state level thank

5443
03:47:01,351 --> 03:47:09,239
you thank you good afternoon my name is

5444
03:47:07,739 --> 03:47:12,209
laurie Bremner with the American Cancer

5445
03:47:09,239 --> 03:47:13,920
Society Cancer Action Network the single

5446
03:47:12,209 --> 03:47:16,259
most important thing that we can do to

5447
03:47:13,920 --> 03:47:18,299
tackle the teeny cigarette epidemic is

5448
03:47:16,260 --> 03:47:21,329
to pass a policy the prohibits the sale

5449
03:47:18,299 --> 03:47:23,129
of all flavored tobacco products passing

5450
03:47:21,329 --> 03:47:24,989
a flavor policy with no exemptions

5451
03:47:23,129 --> 03:47:27,299
ensures that youth don't go from one

5452
03:47:24,989 --> 03:47:28,829
type of tobacco product to another to

5453
03:47:27,299 --> 03:47:30,060
chase the candy flavor that got them

5454
03:47:28,829 --> 03:47:32,700
hooked in the first place

5455
03:47:30,060 --> 03:47:35,610
mint and menthol are extremely popular

5456
03:47:32,700 --> 03:47:37,681
among youth and exempting those flavors

5457
03:47:35,610 --> 03:47:40,739
would undermine all efforts designed to

5458
03:47:37,681 --> 03:47:41,909
limit youth initiation legislators

5459
03:47:40,739 --> 03:47:43,440
introduced two bills

5460
03:47:41,909 --> 03:47:45,119
last year that would have prohibited the

5461
03:47:43,440 --> 03:47:46,710
sale of all flavored tobacco products

5462
03:47:45,120 --> 03:47:49,170
but they did not advance

5463
03:47:46,709 --> 03:47:51,000
jool and other tobacco companies lobby

5464
03:47:49,170 --> 03:47:53,670
furiously against flavor policies

5465
03:47:51,000 --> 03:47:55,729
because they know they will result in a

5466
03:47:53,670 --> 03:47:57,989
reduction of tobacco use in our state

5467
03:47:55,729 --> 03:47:59,729
the American Cancer Society Cancer

5468
03:47:57,989 --> 03:48:00,989
Action Network hopes that the outcome of

5469
03:47:59,729 --> 03:48:03,779
these hearings will be for the

5470
03:48:00,989 --> 03:48:05,010
legislature to adopt the consensus along

5471
03:48:03,780 --> 03:48:07,561
with the public health community and

5472
03:48:05,010 --> 03:48:09,181
more than 40 California cities they're

5473
03:48:07,560 --> 03:48:11,069
prohibiting the sale of all flavored

5474
03:48:09,181 --> 03:48:13,681
tobacco products with no exemptions is

5475
03:48:11,069 --> 03:48:16,590
the best way to combat youth tobacco

5476
03:48:13,681 --> 03:48:18,239
addiction we need to hold Jewel and the

5477
03:48:16,590 --> 03:48:20,399
other tobacco companies accountable for

5478
03:48:18,239 --> 03:48:22,021
the disaster that they've caused by

5479
03:48:20,399 --> 03:48:24,181
passing a bill that prohibits the sale

5480
03:48:22,021 --> 03:48:26,440
of all flavored tobacco products the

5481
03:48:24,181 --> 03:48:28,690
need is urgent we need to get this done

5482
03:48:26,440 --> 03:48:30,700
and just to clarify again for the record

5483
03:48:28,690 --> 03:48:33,280
there's a lot of confiscating on this

5484
03:48:30,700 --> 03:48:35,440
issue that was just on tobacco or on all

5485
03:48:33,280 --> 03:48:36,970
vaping I'm addressing only tobacco ish

5486
03:48:35,440 --> 03:48:39,870
tobacco products but all tobacco

5487
03:48:36,969 --> 03:48:44,670
products including menthol and mint

5488
03:48:39,870 --> 03:48:46,780
combustible cigarettes as well thank you

5489
03:48:44,670 --> 03:48:48,399
hi thanks everybody for coming together

5490
03:48:46,780 --> 03:48:50,050
today my name is Mike Clemens I'm the

5491
03:48:48,399 --> 03:48:51,549
president co-founder of guild extracts

5492
03:48:50,049 --> 03:48:53,649
we're a licensed manufacturer out of

5493
03:48:51,549 --> 03:48:55,359
Oakland California and has been has has

5494
03:48:53,649 --> 03:48:57,489
been explored today California spent

5495
03:48:55,360 --> 03:48:59,560
years carefully crafting a framework of

5496
03:48:57,489 --> 03:49:00,549
regulatory controls to address the

5497
03:48:59,560 --> 03:49:03,369
public health risks that we've been

5498
03:49:00,549 --> 03:49:04,840
talking about today like VAP I I don't

5499
03:49:03,370 --> 03:49:06,340
believe that we're seeing a failure of

5500
03:49:04,840 --> 03:49:08,380
these controls I think that we're seeing

5501
03:49:06,340 --> 03:49:09,940
the result of a failure to adequately

5502
03:49:08,379 --> 03:49:11,770
support the legal cannabis industry

5503
03:49:09,940 --> 03:49:12,851
within this framework the economic

5504
03:49:11,771 --> 03:49:14,230
burdens on the industry from the

5505
03:49:12,851 --> 03:49:16,360
regulatory layer has driven up prices

5506
03:49:14,229 --> 03:49:19,029
and driven consumers to continue to

5507
03:49:16,360 --> 03:49:20,620
purchase from the illicit market to mr.

5508
03:49:19,030 --> 03:49:22,239
Cooper's point a recent audit found

5509
03:49:20,620 --> 03:49:25,510
close to three thousand illegal

5510
03:49:22,239 --> 03:49:28,229
retailers in California versus the 873

5511
03:49:25,510 --> 03:49:31,120
that ms Ajax's team at the BCC has

5512
03:49:28,229 --> 03:49:32,680
licensed a lack of enforcement against

5513
03:49:31,120 --> 03:49:34,180
the bad actors across the state has

5514
03:49:32,680 --> 03:49:35,979
resulted in a black market that's not

5515
03:49:34,180 --> 03:49:38,860
only impossible for regulated businesses

5516
03:49:35,979 --> 03:49:40,750
to compete with but it also operates

5517
03:49:38,860 --> 03:49:42,790
outside of the oversight that's supposed

5518
03:49:40,750 --> 03:49:45,851
to ensure products conform to a safe

5519
03:49:42,790 --> 03:49:47,860
standard furthermore any move to just

5520
03:49:45,851 --> 03:49:49,601
completely ban any product altogether

5521
03:49:47,860 --> 03:49:52,180
will only exacerbate a dangerous

5522
03:49:49,601 --> 03:49:53,739
situation by driving more consumers away

5523
03:49:52,180 --> 03:49:55,870
from a regulated businesses to the

5524
03:49:53,739 --> 03:49:57,219
illicit sources and it still fails to

5525
03:49:55,870 --> 03:49:59,920
address the underlying problem of

5526
03:49:57,219 --> 03:50:01,840
contamination in the supply chain it

5527
03:49:59,920 --> 03:50:03,370
would be disastrous to the industry and

5528
03:50:01,840 --> 03:50:05,290
to the people of California that if has

5529
03:50:03,370 --> 03:50:07,450
entrusted their elected officials to

5530
03:50:05,290 --> 03:50:09,311
work together to make this industry work

5531
03:50:07,450 --> 03:50:10,450
it would also threaten the entire state

5532
03:50:09,310 --> 03:50:11,860
program that we've all worked really

5533
03:50:10,450 --> 03:50:13,630
hard to create so we just need to

5534
03:50:11,860 --> 03:50:15,220
enforce the law and we need to make

5535
03:50:13,629 --> 03:50:19,140
compliance less costly for the good

5536
03:50:15,219 --> 03:50:19,140
actors thank you very much thank you

Maureen banana on behalf of the United

5538
03:50:21,489 --> 03:50:27,521
cannabis Business Association we've

5539
03:50:23,890 --> 03:50:30,459
we've actively have worked to push for

5540
03:50:27,521 --> 03:50:32,050
penalties under props as prop 64 was

5541
03:50:30,459 --> 03:50:35,140
drafted or only to allow for penalties

5542
03:50:32,049 --> 03:50:36,759
for legal operators so for the last

5543
03:50:35,140 --> 03:50:39,579
couple of years you've had state

5544
03:50:36,760 --> 03:50:41,530
agencies and attorney general

5545
03:50:39,579 --> 03:50:43,360
and local law enforcement not having the

5546
03:50:41,530 --> 03:50:46,030
tools necessary to shut down the illegal

5547
03:50:43,360 --> 03:50:49,450
market a B 97 is the first step that we

5548
03:50:46,030 --> 03:50:52,120
worked on a B 1417 which allowed the

5549
03:50:49,450 --> 03:50:53,710
Attorney General District Attorney's and

5550
03:50:52,120 --> 03:50:56,680
city attorneys to impose penalties was

5551
03:50:53,709 --> 03:51:00,699
held in the Senate Appropriations

5552
03:50:56,680 --> 03:51:03,970
Committee we've there's a crisis we are

5553
03:51:00,700 --> 03:51:07,150
legal we have ensured that our products

5554
03:51:03,969 --> 03:51:08,799
are safe a ban on all vaping products

5555
03:51:07,149 --> 03:51:10,810
will only push people to say legal

5556
03:51:08,799 --> 03:51:13,479
market we want to do the right thing and

5557
03:51:10,810 --> 03:51:16,119
we've been advocating this for years and

5558
03:51:13,479 --> 03:51:17,590
now there's a crisis now people are

5559
03:51:16,120 --> 03:51:18,970
saying it the illegal market needs to be

5560
03:51:17,590 --> 03:51:23,560
shut down that we've been advocating

5561
03:51:18,969 --> 03:51:24,909
that for years thank you Thank You mr.

5562
03:51:23,560 --> 03:51:26,170
chairman Tim Madden represent the

5563
03:51:24,909 --> 03:51:27,850
California Chapter of the American

5564
03:51:26,170 --> 03:51:29,530
College of Cardiology and since I'm your

5565
03:51:27,850 --> 03:51:31,420
last person I won't go too much longer

5566
03:51:29,530 --> 03:51:33,460
but consistent with with some other

5567
03:51:31,420 --> 03:51:35,649
folks that have mentioned we believe is

5568
03:51:33,459 --> 03:51:37,959
an organization that a ban on all vaping

5569
03:51:35,649 --> 03:51:39,879
products is the way to go and listening

5570
03:51:37,959 --> 03:51:41,229
to dr. Dean's testimony were the

5571
03:51:39,879 --> 03:51:44,469
Department of Public Health is saying

5572
03:51:41,229 --> 03:51:46,449
people should not be vaping at all we

5573
03:51:44,469 --> 03:51:49,000
think is the prudent approach so we want

5574
03:51:46,450 --> 03:51:51,340
to get to the next level and we are

5575
03:51:49,000 --> 03:51:52,870
asking for a ban similar to what was

5576
03:51:51,340 --> 03:51:54,969
done in Massachusetts although they did

5577
03:51:52,870 --> 03:51:58,380
it on a four month time frame on all

5578
03:51:54,969 --> 03:52:00,849
vaping products thank you thank you

5579
03:51:58,379 --> 03:52:01,869
hello Jared Kyle o president of the

5580
03:52:00,850 --> 03:52:04,450
United cannabis Business Association

5581
03:52:01,870 --> 03:52:07,480
gonna keep it short regulations are just

5582
03:52:04,450 --> 03:52:09,280
suggestions without enforcement that is

5583
03:52:07,479 --> 03:52:10,959
what we need to focus on we are trying

5584
03:52:09,280 --> 03:52:12,430
to build an industry and we're trying to

5585
03:52:10,959 --> 03:52:14,289
keep safety and security amongst our

5586
03:52:12,430 --> 03:52:16,389
consumers and if we don't have a good

5587
03:52:14,290 --> 03:52:18,550
enforcement branch we are just allowing

5588
03:52:16,389 --> 03:52:20,920
these regulations to just kind of go

5589
03:52:18,549 --> 03:52:22,389
pass us by we're not really focusing on

5590
03:52:20,920 --> 03:52:23,710
what the effects are not only for the

5591
03:52:22,389 --> 03:52:25,270
industry as its growth but also the

5592
03:52:23,709 --> 03:52:28,629

5600

5601
03:52:45,430 --> 03:52:50,340
important subject that I know we all

5602
03:52:47,069 --> 03:52:54,390
share a desire to move forward with some

5603
03:52:50,340 --> 03:52:56,280
solutions in concrete activity via early

5604

5614
03:53:16,351 --> 03:53:22,860
additional hearing to explore this issue

5615
03:53:19,290 --> 03:53:25,230
further and just so people know we are

5616
03:53:22,860 --> 03:53:27,569

5617
03:53:25,229 --> 03:53:29,640
of legislative action now until we
