aren't already familiar with you um do

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
you mind starting us off by just

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,079
explaining a little bit about

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,640
your background and how that led into

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,840
working with cannabis in medicine and

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,280
then we'll just kind of spin off from

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,680
there

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,879
all right well about a thousand years

24
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,079
ago

25
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,599
right yeah i feel like it's so long um i

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,439
was a i was a patient

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,920
actually before i even became a

28
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,079
physician a medical doctor

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,040
um i was diagnosed with ankylosing

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,079
spondylitis

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,799
when i was a teenager and it's a

32
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,079
fancy big fancy name it's also called as

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,520
for short

34
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,400
and basically what it is is an

35
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,798
autoimmune disease of the spine

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,680
it's an inflammatory disorder there's no

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,400
cure

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,880
there's really you know no no treatment

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,478
that

40
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,478
that is long-term it's really just

41
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,400
maintenance and palliative care

42
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,719
and what ends up happening is your

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,040
vertebrae so the bones in your spine

44
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,959
start to fuse together they literally

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,920
crazy glued together and you lose

46
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,759
mobility

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,040
yeah so you might you might see people

48
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,640
on the street where they look like they

49
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,320
have a big rod in their back and they're

50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,680
sort of turning

51
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,758
you know with their whole body they

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,600
don't have much range of motion

53
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,519
right and usually those are patients

54
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,599
with as

55
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,599
and i went through conventional

56
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,798
treatment as a teenager and

57
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,280
as a kid i had a lot of pain

58
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,640
but i did you know normal prescription

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,718
medications

60
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,680
i went to physical therapy for many many

61
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,359
years

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,879
did acupuncture um epidurals

63
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,878
i did a lot of injections and trigger

64
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,519
point injections but nothing gave me

65
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,120
long-lasting relief so i wore a back

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
brace while i was in medical school and

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
this was in san francisco

68
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
i went to school shortly after they

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,520
legalized cannabis in san francisco

70
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,039
uh in california and i would wear this

71
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,400
back brace all the time

72
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,159
while i was doing rounds and one of my

73
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,000
attendings pulled me aside and said you

74
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,598
know what's going on why are you

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,759
wearing this brace you're having a hard

76
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,639
time standing you know assisting in the

77
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,239
or

78
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,919
you know delivering babies i see that

79
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,159
you're sort of standing on the side

80
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,119
trying to sit down and you're in a lot

81
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,680
of pain

82
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,400
i told them i had a yes and that i was

83
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,159
really

84
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,159
disheartened i was really sad because

85
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,479
here i was training to be a doctor

86
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,000
you know i had at my disposal you know

87
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,199
hundreds of specialists

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,959
i was in this great university and no

89
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,318
one could really offer me any relief

90
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,319
you know it was sort of the same

91
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,280
revolving door you know here's another

92
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,199
prescription

93
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,400
have you tried an epidural have you

94
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,958
tried steroids

95
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,080
yes yes you know and there's a lot of

96
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,439
meds that i couldn't take

97
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,680
you know when you're working in the

98
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,318
hospital or you're studying you can't be

99
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,760
sedated you can't be altered in any way

100
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,679
so um surprisingly he pulled me aside

101
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,560
and this was an hiv and aids doctor

102
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,959
and he handed me this bottle okay and he

103
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,479
said

104
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,158
you know don't tell anyone i'm giving

105
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,878
you this don't freak out

106
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:33,439
but um this is marijuana this is

107
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,518
marijuana that's in a tincture bottle

108
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,878
and it helps my hiv and aids patients

109
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,719
with pain

110
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,000
he didn't call it cbd oil or anything

111
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,560
fancy like that he just said it's

112
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,080
marijuana you know steeped in alcohol

113
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,158
take it before you go to bed at night

114
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,120
but it really helps my hiv and aids

115
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,000
patients

116
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,360
um and i completely freaked out you know

117
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,039
i grew up in the bronx

118
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,480
and i grew up in a very traditional

119
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,158
chinese household

120
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,158
so there was a stigma surrounding

121
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,679
cannabis you know i

122
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,438
was a pre-med i had my eye on the prize

123
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,280
i didn't really experiment with cannabis

124
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,878
a lot but i knew

125
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
and he said it too he said you know

126
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,798
you're you're gonna work

127
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,560
80 to 100 hours a week and you have a

128
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,400
long way to go

129
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,798
and you really are not going to make it

130
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,798
you know with just this back brace

131
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,120
so i sat with it on my dresser for weeks

132
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,198
on end and i stare at it and i

133
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,360
i finally took it i took it over the

134
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,400
weekend when i wasn't on call

135
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,199
and to my surprise it did make me feel a

136
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,519
little funky

137
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,639
it reminded me of when i first had a

138
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,879
glass of wine

139
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,560
you know a little i got a little flushed

140
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,240
but nothing crazy

141
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,000
but you know by the time the weekend was

142
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,680
over by monday morning i knew something

143
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,560
was working because i was able to stand

144
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,800
and do the dishes

145
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,120
without the back brace i was able to do

146
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,800
some some light household chores without

147
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,800
you know pain

148
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,520
and i went up to him that next week and

149
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,160
i said what is in this

150
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,758
i said what is this and how come more

151
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,360
patients don't know about it

152
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,600
and he started explaining you know

153
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,120
cannabis to me and and you know what it

154
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,240
is what it isn't

155
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,199
um you know he basically took me aside

156
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,840
and he says you know there's this

157
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,400
journal club that meets there's other

158
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,439
mds

159
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,918
you know if you want to start learning

160
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,560
about this plant you know let's uh by

161
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:15,839
all means

162
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,478
let's let's start looking at these

163
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,478
different cases and i made it a point

164
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,399
for my career to learn everything i

165
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:23,439
could about this plant medicine you know

166
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,000
and this was

167
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,319
you know in the 2000s so you know a lot

168
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,120
has changed since then

169
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,159
but patients found me i didn't have to

170
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,280
advertise i integrated into

171
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,240
my holistic uh family practice and word

172
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,478
spread fast

173
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,000
because patients could appreciate the

174
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,159
fact that they could

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,839
tell me about cannabis usage tell me

176
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,280
about their other medication usage

177
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,439
without feeling

178
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,959
like um the doctor was going to dismiss

179
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,639
them from their practice

180
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,719
yeah yeah and that's

181
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,680
you know one of the huge challenges that

182
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,560
it seems like

183
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,879
you know we face right now with cannabis

184
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,680
is

185
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,120
getting people to one to get the doctors

186
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,918
and nurses educated

187
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,038
to know how to respond when someone

188
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,478
comes to them

189
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,318
saying you know i want to try cannabis

190
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,800
or i am using it you know

191
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,680
but then also on the the patient side to

192
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,120
have that

193
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,600
um sense of safety um

194
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,639
with the physician to be able to just

195
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,000
honestly share

196
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,680
what they're experiencing what they're

197
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,560
experimenting with and everything

198
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,478
um because i think uh and tell me if you

199
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,839
agree but there's a weird dynamic that's

200
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:32,719
happened in our health care system it

201
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,399
seems

202
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,039
primarily based on my own experience

203
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,560
that um the patient and the doctor don't

204
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,839
always feel like they're on the journey

205
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,720
together

206
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,359
um and so the patient even though they

207
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,960
may have

208
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,639
you know their primary care physician or

209
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,680
their specialist that they see regularly

210
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,519
they don't always

211
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,000
feel like i don't know they feel very

212
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,038
alone in their pursuit of wellness and

213
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,519
trying to

214
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,478
to get better um and so it's almost like

215
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,318
this

216
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,159
uh like the cannabis piece is sort of

217
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,879
raising a bigger issue in

218
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,319
healthcare broadly that stems from how

219
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,319
stressed a lot of doctors are

220
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,840
how limited amount of time they have to

221
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,319
spend with patients

222
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,198
um you know all these these other pieces

223
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,080
as well

224
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,598
um that i think we need to like really

225
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,199
seriously look at if we want to

226
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,439
improve our health care system and have

227
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,319
people feel that sense of trust again

228
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,918
with their

229
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,879
physicians and i know that i went

230
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,198
through a very similar

231
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,959
experience so i have like multiple

232
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,879
spinal cord injuries

233
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,439
and so i've been through i've worn the

234
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,199
back braces i've been on steroids

235
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,120
you know i've you know been on all of

236
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,000
these things i totally understand

237
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,680
and one thing that um before you and i

238
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,399
had ever talked i felt this

239
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,879
um like connection with you because i

240
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,560
saw

241
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,759
on a i think it's a different interview

242
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,879
or something you talking about your

243
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,199
personal background

244
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,039
i was like oh my gosh i've been through

245
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,280
at least a piece of that

246
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,478
and the same way i discovered cannabis

247
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,239
as a patient

248
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,918
before i ever got involved in like uh

249
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,680
testing labs and research and all that

250
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,719
sort of stuff and it was through a very

251
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,598
similar

252
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,879
sort of thing i was like literally stuck

253
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,120
to the couch couldn't move

254
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,560
had these like back spasms and extreme

255
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,759
pain felt like someone was like driving

256
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,598
a knife and my

257
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,400
spine you know just crazy so i can

258
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,759
i can very much relate to um you know at

259
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,918
least to some extent

260
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,919
of what you went through because it's

261
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,318
traumatic going through that process of

262
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:25,758
like

263
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,000
how do i find relief with a chronic

264
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,000
condition like this you know

265
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,958
um without being just knocked out all

266
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,360
the time it's really hard

267
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,799
absolutely and it ha takes a huge toll

268
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,200
on your nervous system

269
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,639
um you know you're you feel like this

270
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,919
can't be my legacy

271
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,399
i cannot live like this um and and we're

272
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,319
young

273
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,440
yeah you know we're young and we're you

274
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,120
know when you think of someone with

275
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
chronic pain you think of grandma

276
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,240
you know that's in their 80s or 90s but

277
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,880
chronic pain

278
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,278
you know hits even teenagers i see with

279
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,600
overuse injuries through sports

280
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,559
um through a lot of genetic disorders as

281
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,879
well

282
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,479
so you so being a chronic pain survivor

283
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,278
i really know what it's like when you

284
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,159
tell the doctor

285
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,278
i've tried everything and it doesn't

286
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,319
work

287
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,320
you almost don't want to go to the

288
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,600
physician because you know the the

289
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,440
things that they're going to offer you

290
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,440
right it's either surgery um

291
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,399
prescription medications or pt

292
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,279
yeah yeah exactly right you're like i've

293
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,360
heard the story

294
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,120
multiple times oh you want to do another

295
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,839
mri okay

296
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,360
yeah exactly what's going to change you

297
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,560
know my pain is my pain

298
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,720
yeah um but i mean really i think

299
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,359
this whole medical cannabis movement is

300
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,200
a wake-up call to our health care system

301
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,560
you know patients are turning away from

302
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,600
mainstream medicine

303
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,000
you know they're heading to forums to to

304
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,120
listening to podcasts like yours on

305
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,039
places like um

306
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,039
wendy's shop artemis um cbd shop because

307
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,719
they're giving them what they need you

308
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,759
know they're you know you

309
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,278
um as an advocate um they're listening

310
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,080
to these podcasts they're connecting

311
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,838
better

312
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,000
and they're looking for a more natural

313
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,360
approach to health and healing

314
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,639
yeah exactly and so coming back around

315
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,120
so you were

316
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,078
you're in medical school you discovered

317
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,200
cannabis

318
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,000
and were able to start to function

319
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,360
better

320
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,278
um where did your path lead after that

321
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,800
um kind of how did the rest of your

322
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,759
medical schooling go and then where

323
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:30,879
where what did you specialize in

324
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:34,399
so i specialized in integrative care

325
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,078
so what i knew was i i understood

326
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,440
that you know cannabis was part of a

327
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:38,639
holistic movement

328
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,120
and that it wasn't going to be the

329
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,919
end-all be-all even for myself right

330
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,519
i knew that when i integrated cannabis i

331
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,360
then i could get up off the couch

332
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,120
then maybe i could give a breather and

333
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,919
take my back brace off for a couple of

334
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,039
hours

335
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:56,399
but i needed to utilize those hours and

336
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,078
exercise you know do some foam roller

337
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,120
exercises maybe take a trip to the

338
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,479
acupuncturist

339
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,480
i'm an osteopathic physician so i also

340
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,600
use my hands to help heal patients i do

341
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,440
manipulation

342
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,120
you know i work on the fascia and the

343
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,399
tendons and the ligaments

344
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,600
so hands-on approach for patients

345
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,200
so so cannabis breaks that storm you

346
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,079
know it sort of parts the clouds a

347
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,759
little bit

348
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,199
and then it allows you to do other

349
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,360
things um

350
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,360
you know for me you know losing weight

351
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,800
was a big thing i had to lose a lot of

352
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,600
weight i gained a lot of weight in

353
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,599
medical school

354
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,440
you know the freshman 15 became the

355
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,759
freshman 50 right

356
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,560
right you know because when you're in

357
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,679
pain

358
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,199
you eat for comfort and

359
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,359
and you know that ice cream that hot

360
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,200
chocolate just feels so good

361
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,360
right when you're sitting on the couch

362
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,160
but you know an anti-inflammatory diet i

363
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,680
talk to my patients about it

364
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,679
i have a background in nutrition so

365
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,519
that's a really really big thing

366
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,759
so i incorporate all these different

367
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,480
modalities with my patients and i'm

368
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,360
realistic

369
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,200
you know might not all happen at once

370
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,759
but maybe it's a start with cannabis

371
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,079
medicine

372
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,159
and it's a 10 minute walk you know

373
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,799
getting those lymphatics moving

374
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,000
or maybe it is a massage you know

375
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,519
something like that so i

376
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,799
try to work around the patients and

377
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,919
that's how we created our integrative

378
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,559
health centers in in california and can

379
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,399
you

380
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,838
briefly describe to anyone listening

381
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,839
that's maybe not familiar with

382
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,360
like osteopathic medicine versus

383
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,000
allopathic medicine and all these sort

384
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,159
of things

385
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,639
um can you describe sort of what that

386
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,958
means to be an osteopathic doctor

387
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,560
um you know versus other other types of

388
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,319
physicians that sort of thing

389
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,879
sure sure so there's two types of

390
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,879
physicians in the u.s there's mds

391
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,399
and there's do's right and these are

392
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,000
medical doctors it stands for medical

393
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,278
doctor d.o stands for doctor of

394
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,559
osteopathy

395
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:51,600
now we have the exact same licensure so

396
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:54,078
we work in the same hospitals the same

397
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,440
privileges i can write all prescriptions

398
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,159
admit you to the hospital

399
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,120
mris insurance companies cover us etc

400
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,958
etc

401
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,799
the main difference between doctors of

402
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,838
osteopathy is that we take an

403
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,759
extra year sometimes two years of

404
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,959
anatomy and physiology

405
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:14,000
so we have a much more

406
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,039
deeper understanding of musculoskeletal

407
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,759
system

408
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,838
and some of us very few of us but some

409
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,039
of us go into what's called osteopathic

410
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,079
manipulative medicine

411
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:26,159
and that's what i specialize in

412
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,159
and we use our hands to help heal

413
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,559
patients now it's becoming

414
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,679
much more rare and rare as

415
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,319
pharmaceuticals

416
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,278
became the main you know the mainstream

417
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,000
so most of

418
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,679
most do's are just like regular

419
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,480
physicians and don't do any hands-on

420
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,638
medicine

421
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,879
but there's about three percent of do's

422
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,000
so there's a few of us left

423
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,320
that uh still still practice

424
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,039
uh osteopathic medicine yeah and it's

425
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,399
tradition

426
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,039
yeah and um what specifically kind of

427
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,879
drew you

428
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:02,000
into that route versus uh the md route

429
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,919
my pain yeah my pain so i

430
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,839
originally started as a physical therapy

431
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,240
major i knew

432
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,279
you know i i did pt as a teenager and i

433
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,278
saw okay well this

434
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,639
is helpful yeah you know maybe i can

435
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:13,759
become a physical therapist or a

436
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,759
chiropractor

437
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,039
i was very interested in anatomy and

438
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,159
physiology

439
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,639
so i was a pt at cornell actually

440
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,198
and i was going to get my master's in pt

441
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,320
um

442
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:29,439
as an um after i graduated as undergrad

443
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,040
and i met a do actually while i was

444
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,560
there and he

445
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,399
adjusted me he gave me my first

446
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,638
adjustment you know i was again

447
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,240
in pain in college already so i was

448
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,799
looking for alternative

449
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,159
uh relief and i and i said what what are

450
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,679
you doing you're not a chiropractor and

451
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,879
you said no i'm a do and i said you know

452
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,359
what's a do

453
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,320
and he explained to me about osteopathy

454
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,839
and he says you know

455
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,519
you're a physician so you can have all

456
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,040
the privileges as a physician

457
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,399
except you learn how to um manipulate

458
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,519
and you learn more about anatomy and

459
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,320
physiology

460
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,639
so i said sign me up i changed my major

461
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,920
i

462
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,240
became pre-med and

463
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,519
and the rest is history wow that's

464
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,759
really cool

465
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,560
and how would you describe your

466
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,799
experience

467
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,159
working with a patient that was trying

468
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,679
to work with cannabis

469
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:20,319
for the first time what was that like

470
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,519
so for me it was important having my own

471
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,519
experience

472
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,240
because i could relate to to patients

473
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,000
that were naive you know i was very very

474
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,600
cannabis naive i didn't know what to

475
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,519
expect oh my god my

476
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,839
my mother said i would get schizophrenia

477
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,399
right if i ever tried cannabis right yes

478
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,399
so

479
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,759
so i came from this really big fear

480
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,919
factor um

481
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,120
but for me it was number one was

482
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,439
education you know

483
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,560
what what does cannabis mean let's break

484
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,880
it down to

485
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,399
plant medicine plant sciences you know

486
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,000
what does it mean to even try

487
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,198
alternative medicine

488
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,399
dr andrew weil is one of my mentors

489
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,958
so i really you know looked at at that

490
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,559
realm

491
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:03,679
as education first acupuncture

492
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,518
is a really big part of my practice

493
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,439
i was a researcher at columbia

494
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,639
university

495
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,360
women's health center and we research

496
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,839
acupuncture and uterine fibroids so for

497
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,600
me

498
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,279
when you think outside the box and

499
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,360
you're seeing an md

500
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,399
the biggest thing is expectations for

501
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,919
the patient

502
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,759
and education yeah yeah and

503
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:29,838
what were uh people coming to you

504
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,440
uh to treat what were some of the the

505
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,040
common things that you were seeing that

506
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,000
people were turning to cannabis for

507
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,719
i imagine pain is one of them pain is

508
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,958
one of them

509
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,000
um but also i saw a lot of children

510
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,239
actually i treated

511
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,879
mostly children in california for the

512
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,879
first i would say five to seven years

513
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,159
um children and these were you know

514
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,720
these are patients that have tried

515
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,639
everything

516
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,839
you know like you and me they've gone

517
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,759
through the whole

518
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,360
you know 10 different md's 10

519
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,079
specialists and flew all over the

520
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,159
country

521
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,559
to different you know centers um you

522
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,719
know from maryland to texas to

523
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,558
and they've seen all the specialists and

524
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,318
i was their last hope

525
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,399
you know they heard that cannabis could

526
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,438
work um these were children with

527
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,199
epilepsy

528
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,120
children with cancer mitochondrial

529
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,199
disorders genetic disorders they came in

530
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,719
wheelchairs they were non-ambulatory

531
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,839
right they weren't walking they weren't

532
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,558
talking these were special needs kids

533
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,838
and then it expanded to adults that were

534
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,759
in chronic pain

535
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,000
you know adults with ms adults living

536
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,119
with fibromyalgia

537
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
autoimmune diseases als parkinson's

538
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,918
where there really is no there really is

539
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,440
no answer for chronic diseases no

540
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,880
chronic pain diseases

541
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,038
yeah and of some of the

542
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,320
let's focus on the children for just a

543
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,720
second because i think that's really

544
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:50,240
important to talk about

545
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,640
what what were some of the successes and

546
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,919
failures that you experienced working

547
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,480
with kids in some of these conditions

548
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,080
the biggest thing with children is and

549
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,599
it was important part of our practice

550
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,199
is to make sure that there was a team

551
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,798
approach and still

552
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:10,558
is so i i really want to make sure that

553
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,960
the child's neurologist the pediatrician

554
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,319
the psychiatrist is on board when

555
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,640
they're working with a

556
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,639
an integrated physician such as myself

557
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,000
so the having that conversation about

558
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,840
cannabis

559
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,919
having that conversation with both

560
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,000
parents caregivers guardians of the room

561
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,400
and the specialists so that they know

562
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,359
that we're all a team here and we're not

563
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,880
um you know

564
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,399
trying to say get off all your

565
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,720
medication you know

566
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,240
that that's not the point when they come

567
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,160
see someone like me

568
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,160
it's really an integrative it's the best

569
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,000
of both worlds

570
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,759
so that is the number one thing and then

571
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,400
working closely with parents because

572
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,759
sometimes the spouses are at odds

573
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,400
mom might say i'm full on supporting cbd

574
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,440
and

575
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,240
cannabis and dad or their partner

576
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,000
will say i'm against it this is not what

577
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,759
i want for my child

578
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,279
yeah so again communication education

579
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:08,160
um you know expectations is is key

580
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,038
and when you ran into those sort of

581
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,960
conflicts

582
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,240
where you might have parents that

583
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,679
disagree with one another

584
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,839
or or maybe even other physicians

585
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,080
involved in the child's care

586
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,439
what were some of the key sort of like

587
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,240
pieces of education

588
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,880
that would help sort of calm those those

589
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,679
fears a bit

590
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,880
the for my colleagues so for other mds

591
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,280
the biggest thing is

592
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,960
sending them you know research articles

593
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:35,519
you know talking to them about patient

594
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,240
cases

595
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,879
and sometimes i'll go and do grand

596
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,120
rounds

597
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,320
you know do a noon conference a journal

598
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,798
a journal club

599
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,480
and talk to colleagues on their level

600
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,759
you know what is what's happening on the

601
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,240
receptor level

602
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,240
um things like that and and you know

603
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,000
sometimes they go from you know sort of

604
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,759
folding their arms and and their

605
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,519
eyebrows are just furrowed

606
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,119
and they're really angry to like they

607
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,440
relax their face a little bit

608
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,199
and say okay this is not voodoo medicine

609
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,679
right there's actually some science

610
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,120
behind

611
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,519
it um and and also to reassure them

612
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,798
that i'm working with the parents so

613
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,319
they're not

614
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,519
off getting something off you know from

615
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:17,599
who knows where

616
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,798
you know there is some monitoring

617
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,918
there's charting

618
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,200
so i'm charting everything and and

619
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,880
documenting everything

620
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,960
my the parents that i work with are

621
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,320
keeping journals so we know

622
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,038
we know how it affects iep or how it

623
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,558
affects

624
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,960
you know what is the child's teacher

625
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:35,759
saying or the speech therapist or ot or

626
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,880
pt

627
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,960
so we document everything and we

628
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,200
monitor them very closely there's a lot

629
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,120
of follow-ups in the beginning

630
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,319
because i want to make sure that the

631
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,000
parents are

632
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,639
feeling supported that they're doing it

633
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,319
right you know titration of dosing

634
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,159
making sure there's feedback from all

635
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,558
the ancillary health practitioners as

636
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,600
well

637
00:20:54,558 --> 00:21:00,879
yeah and what were the main

638
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,240
modes of administration um that most of

639
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,640
these kids would use were they using

640
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,038
like

641
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,720
um tinctures or raw oil capsules

642
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,000
in the beginning it was just tinctures

643
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,400
you know in the beginning the parents

644
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,640
were

645
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,080
and this is you know we're talking a

646
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,440
little more than 10 years ago they're

647
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,119
making their own

648
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,120
they're growing their own a few plants

649
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,839
of their own so in california parents

650
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,918
were allowed

651
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,678
to grow their own cannabis that was part

652
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,759
of the medical cannabis

653
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,798
legalization and they would steep their

654
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,679
own

655
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,158
sometimes smoothies they make teas out

656
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,480
of it

657
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,679
um sometimes they would put it in ice

658
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,440
cubes

659
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,120
and you know and just put it in their

660
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,480
juice and the kids juice

661
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,599
so parents got creative and parents are

662
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,319
very resourceful

663
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,639
you're a dad i'm i'm a mom so we would

664
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,960
do anything for our children and the

665
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,799
the forums and the support the community

666
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,600
was just astounding

667
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,960
um parents found that each other uh and

668
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,879
shared stories

669
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,159
and talked about anecdotally what worked

670
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,640
and what didn't work

671
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,960
um shared um you know sort of this like

672
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,679
trusted integrative practitioner list

673
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,360
things like that um and we all put our

674
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,798
heads together and figured out and tried

675
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,558
to learn from each other parent

676
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,879
you know parents patients teach me just

677
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:15,759
as much as i teach them yeah

678
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,080
and um going into what you just said of

679
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,679
like

680
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,839
trying to discover what works what

681
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,200
doesn't work and obviously that's a

682
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,798
loaded question because it depends on

683
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,519
the condition and the person and the

684
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:25,839
dose and the

685
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,519
you know all these different things but

686
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,199
what were some of those lessons that you

687
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:29,759
learned working with all these patients

688
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,558
about

689
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:35,200
what typically worked better than others

690
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:37,200
what forms tended to be

691
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,960
better than others i you know that sort

692
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,960
of thing

693
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,640
so for the biggest thing for children

694
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,960
it's getting them to take it

695
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,440
right the taste you know and and when i

696
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,558
when i'm treating special needs kids

697
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,038
they're very sensitive to taste you know

698
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:52,879
if

699
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,079
that a lot of these children are on the

700
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,559
same diet

701
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,279
because if if you veer from texture or

702
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,359
taste

703
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,720
they just won't eat it so that was the

704
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,759
biggest tricky

705
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,240
thing that's why moms will make

706
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,440
you know the ice cubes or they juiced it

707
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,880
or they steeped it in tea

708
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,558
or they were you know really creative

709
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,120
and put it in honey or something like

710
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:12,960
that

711
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,158
ice cream even you know whatever they

712
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,319
could

713
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,400
so ingestion just getting them into the

714
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,519
child was a big thing

715
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,159
and then also timing so some children

716
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,639
did better

717
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,360
taking it before school some children

718
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,919
did better

719
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,399
after school you know before therapy

720
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,200
even

721
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,320
so we really looked at timing of the

722
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
medicine

723
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,558
for seizure children of course rubbing

724
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,480
it uh sublingually

725
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:39,599
you know in their gums yeah i was very

726
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,759
helpful or

727
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,959
a lot of the moms uh made a

728
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,240
suppositories

729
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,400
uh and this was you know in the very

730
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,759
beginning making suppositories and and

731
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,720
seeing if it would work

732
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,839
um and that was well documented as well

733
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,839
so

734
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,038
parents got creative because when you're

735
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,879
when you see your child

736
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,119
seizing and this is the only thing that

737
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,480
works and they've tried the conventional

738
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:04,479
anti-epileptic medicines um they

739
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,679
they tell 10 more families and then 10

740
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,200
more families come in

741
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,840
right yeah and um the cannabis that they

742
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,720
were using were these thc varieties cbd

743
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,240
varieties

744
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,880
uh mixture you know along the spectrum

745
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,278
you know what were they working with

746
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,799
there

747
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:22,960
there were mixtures there were mixtures

748
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,798
along the spectrum um you know the very

749
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,079
beginning we weren't calling it cbd or

750
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:27,519
thc

751
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,359
there's just so many different chemical

752
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,278
variants um you know

753
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,278
i helped connect them with different

754
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,599
growers different cultivators

755
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,960
and we knew you know this cultivator was

756
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,399
able to grow something that didn't make

757
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,640
the kid very sleepy

758
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,159
right so obviously it was lower in thc

759
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,880
but that's how we documented in the

760
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,840
beginning

761
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,120
and as technology changed as you know

762
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,359
more and more things uh

763
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,558
information was made widely available i

764
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,359
mean i use both

765
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:55,278
cbd and thc for children it really just

766
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,959
depends on what the goals are

767
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,038
what the disease of the symptom and not

768
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,480
symptomatology is

769
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,798
and also working with how functional the

770
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,919
child is as well

771
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,720
yeah and you mentioned titration um i

772
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,880
think that's something

773
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,880
when i was when i was talking with wendy

774
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,039
that was something we got into because

775
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,320
from her experience running a store she

776
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:20,158
noticed that a lot of people

777
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:22,720
are not exposed to uh that process

778
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,559
of trying to find kind of the minimum

779
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,839
effective dose and to know

780
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,319
you know what you're working with so can

781
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,918
you describe a little bit about

782
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,519
you know for instance right now with cbd

783
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,840
being so popular if people are running

784
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,599
out

785
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:37,599
trying to um you know find a product and

786
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,000
trying to find a dose what does

787
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,278
that titration look look like and how

788
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,278
low do you start

789
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:47,278
and kind of um how much time do you wait

790
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,960
to pass before you up the dose that sort

791
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:49,759
of thing and just describe a little bit

792
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,319
what the

793
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,640
process looks like so very different

794
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,519
between children and adults

795
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,278
actually with the pediatric community

796
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,158
the parents were very familiar with

797
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:02,000
titration

798
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,720
you know as you know even with your baby

799
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,798
tylenol everything comes in a liquid

800
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,839
and um even with anti-seizure

801
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,200
medications

802
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,519
things like that everything comes in a

803
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,440
liquid and they knew how to titrate

804
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,038
you know they knew they know they know

805
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,759
how to titrate they know how

806
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,200
to and as a parent if you look at your

807
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,720
child and they have this glaze over

808
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,840
their eyes you already know they're sick

809
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,240
right usually that doesn't take much um

810
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,399
they're

811
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,640
you know parents are very intuitive for

812
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,880
adults it's a little bit trickier

813
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,200
yeah you know i think we have higher

814
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,640
pain tolerance we sort of kind of just

815
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,240
power through things um so it or we want

816
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,559
instant gratification yeah

817
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,759
um and we want that cbd to work now you

818
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,240
know yesterday

819
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,879
how come it's not working right yeah

820
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,919
yeah no

821
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,960
exactly so it's easier to work with

822
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,600
pediatrics actually

823
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,360
it's easy for adults too to like i don't

824
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,599
know really confound

825
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,798
variables and things too when they're

826
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,000
they're sharing what they're what

827
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,119
they're doing

828
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,759
and what are the given that children and

829
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,599
adults are so different just in like

830
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,440
surface area and metabolism and that

831
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,079
sort of thing i know that in the early

832
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,840
days

833
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,918
you probably didn't have access to

834
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,359
really sophisticated dosaging data

835
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,799
because there weren't even i mean

836
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,158
i'm trying to think of when testing labs

837
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,000
really started to come along i mean

838
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,600
steep hill was one of the early ones in

839
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,960
california

840
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,558
but that still was not that long ago

841
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,480
but based on your experience now what

842
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,918
are some of those dosage differences

843
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,720
between children and

844
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:37,120
adults so with children um

845
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,000
it's i'm just thinking of kids that are

846
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:39,599
my autism

847
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,240
patients for example or kids that

848
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:45,278
ourselves have self-injurious behaviors

849
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,558
that accumulation of cannabinoids can

850
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:50,000
really take a toll

851
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,359
on them so parents might notice that

852
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,919
things are working really well for the

853
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,519
first

854
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,360
you know two to three weeks there's what

855
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,158
i call the honeymoon stage

856
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:58,479
and the child is really you know you

857
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,039
know

858
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,000
even keeled grounded really feels

859
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:04,398
comfortable in their own

860
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,038
skin and then all of a sudden it starts

861
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,079
to turn

862
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,720
at the 30-day mark maybe and you they

863
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:10,879
notice that

864
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,480
the child is just more hyper you know

865
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,080
the um

866
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,038
the motor ticks sort of amp up

867
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,158
or they um they just feel like they're a

868
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,798
little bit more

869
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,840
more like hand biting even or the

870
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,798
repetitive

871
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,319
um uh echolalia where they're saying

872
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,798
things over and over again

873
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:33,038
that might uptick as well and i find

874
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,558
that to be the case as the cannabinoids

875
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,839
build up in their system

876
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,519
so less is more and um

877
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,199
and i actually find it a little bit

878
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:42,720
harder now than it

879
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,038
than i was than it was when i was

880
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,919
practicing in california because

881
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,640
information is so readily available and

882
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,000
there's just

883
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,600
you know there's 8 000 products

884
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,880
available so parents are trying all

885
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,719
these different products

886
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,720
adding this adding that how come that

887
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,880
didn't work i read on facebook

888
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,919
that this brand works so i tried this

889
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,480
brand and i added

890
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,000
you know 0.5 milliliters another five

891
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,200
drops another 10 drops

892
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,679
and so it does get muddy but really

893
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,440
staying the course and and i mean i

894
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,600
sometimes i have to hand hold a lot of

895
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,960
a lot of these parents and just say no

896
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,158
you want to stay with

897
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,880
0.2 milliliters of this brand for a 30

898
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,039
days

899
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,480
you know just hang in there i know i

900
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:23,200
know you're not getting the results that

901
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,360
you're getting

902
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,880
but we're doing it slowly you know then

903
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,240
talk about sleep hygiene

904
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,000
you know talking to the physical

905
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,679
therapist or the speech therapist

906
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,119
you know sort of tweaking things that

907
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,919
way

908
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,359
with adults it's the same thing you know

909
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,080
being patient

910
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,759
knowing that to decrease inflammation in

911
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:45,038
the body takes time

912
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:47,599
and um and i actually really encourage

913
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,440
the adults let's say we're talking about

914
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:50,798
um you know chronic pain for instance or

915
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,840
even insomnia

916
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:56,558
um to to add in

917
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:58,319
exercise meditation you know sleep

918
00:29:56,558 --> 00:29:59,918
hygiene getting off the computer

919
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,439
and electronics you know two to three

920
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,880
hours before bed

921
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,000
um so it really takes i would say

922
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,880
a lot of other approaches not just the

923
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,240
cannabis

924
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,080
yeah exactly and when uh

925
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,519
patients are going through that process

926
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,759
and trying to kind of fig

927
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:20,000
find the uh i guess sort of like the

928
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,558
plateau of therapeutic response

929
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,519
how long do you prefer them to wait

930
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,359
before

931
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,639
you know you would make a judgment about

932
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,599
what that

933
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,080
uh cannabinoid therapy is actually doing

934
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,278
a month

935
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,759
a month yeah mm-hmm i know everyone

936
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:35,359
frowns

937
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,038
i mean i don't want to wait a month yeah

938
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:40,079
i mean but that's you know

939
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,119
that's really common with you know a lot

940
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,480
of other drugs

941
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,239
you know when you're working with a

942
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,240
physician and trying to find you know

943
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,558
dosaging a lot of times you might

944
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,200
only see a doctor once a month or so and

945
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:54,240
that's usually you know kind of

946
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,798
how it goes um so it's

947
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,919
it's not that surprising but um i could

948
00:30:56,798 --> 00:30:59,599
i can understand that

949
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,200
that's not necessarily the message a lot

950
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,839
of people want to hear

951
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,880
um because they do want to see those

952
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:06,079
results and

953
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,240
you know another thing you you just

954
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,558
touched on is sort of this um

955
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,839
like biphasic response that cannabinoids

956
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,398
have that

957
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,918
um at certain dosages they do one thing

958
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,558
but then as they build

959
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,000
or as you increase dose or whatever you

960
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:20,558
all of a sudden get to this other side

961
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,038
of this

962
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,119
you know curve this dose response curve

963
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:25,759
and you may be having less effect or a

964
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:28,798
negative

965
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,000
effect yeah and i think that's critical

966
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:31,440
i'm glad you highlighted that because

967
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
that's something that i think needs to

968
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,519
be talked about

969
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,398
more in the context of um using cannabis

970
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,240
as medicine

971
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:42,558
um and i think that's largely a

972
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,759
reflection of sort of this it's not just

973
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,240
the united states but this kind of

974
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,679
mentality that we have of like you know

975
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,000
more is better and

976
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,399
um you know if if a little bit was

977
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,159
helping then take more and take more and

978
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:55,839
um you know we have a sense of tolerance

979
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,320
but that biphasic response is something

980
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,839
i think

981
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:59,359
that we don't necessarily have a large

982
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,439
appreciation for

983
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,639
and some people when they might be on

984
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,159
that other side of the curve they might

985
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,159
think they've just built tolerance

986
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,840
and so then they add more and more and

987
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,960
you have to try to overcome that

988
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,720
exactly yeah exactly yeah exactly

989
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,240
and i mean and we when we look at

990
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,600
medicine you know we do that at the

991
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,640
doctor's office when you're being

992
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,000
prescribed

993
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,840
um blood pressure medication yeah or

994
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,919
diabetes medication you come back and

995
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,319
you retest you know maybe your sugars

996
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,559
aren't quite controlled so we'll adjust

997
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,278
it or your blood pressure even

998
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,879
antidepressants anti-anxiety medications

999
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,398
you know doctors will tell you it takes

1000
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,919
six to eight weeks to

1001
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,079
you know see if there's a there's going

1002
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,679
to be a therapeutic response

1003
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:42,000
and if it doesn't work they're going to

1004
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,640
have to switch to another medication

1005
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,679
so so same thing with pharmaceutical

1006
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,080
medications and

1007
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,759
and i know you had have um kevin

1008
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,639
spellman on before and

1009
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,798
i adore him but we're looking at this

1010
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,360
plant that's affecting so many receptors

1011
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:57,599
that

1012
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,959
that's why everyone is so different

1013
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:02,000
right exactly yeah

1014
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,480
and as much as we understand now it's

1015
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,359
still

1016
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,558
only you know this fraction of a piece

1017
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,558
of a puzzle

1018
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,480
um that we're trying to piece together

1019
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:12,079
you know one thing i really enjoy

1020
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,440
talking to kevin about in that

1021
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:15,519
in that interview is you know about the

1022
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,320
endocannabinoid system and just how

1023
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,919
complicated it is and that you know we

1024
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:20,798
kind of have maybe some general

1025
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,559
understanding

1026
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,079
of some of the things it's doing and the

1027
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,398
other

1028
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:28,319
receptor systems it's connected to and

1029
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,079
all the sort of thing but we're still

1030
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,599
a long way and this came out in my

1031
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,079
interview with ethan rousseau as well

1032
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,918
that

1033
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,519
we don't have good ways of measuring the

1034
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,440
system you know

1035
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,720
the definition of the system is like

1036
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,080
rapidly expanding

1037
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,319
as we learn more and so it's

1038
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:45,918
it's really tricky and sometimes i think

1039
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:47,519
there's a perception

1040
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,000
especially within the canvas industry in

1041
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,519
general that you know we know so much

1042
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and so we should be able to use that

1043
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,720
information

1044
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,319
to really target treatments and you know

1045
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,440
make super informed decisions and we can

1046
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,200
definitely make better informed

1047
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,919
decisions than we ever could

1048
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,319
um but it's just yeah it's just not

1049
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,519
quite there yet so a lot of it is still

1050
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,199
trial and error moving slowly um

1051
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,159
trying to control as many variables as

1052
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:15,279
you can and and proceed with caution

1053
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,878
and yeah absolutely and i i see a lot of

1054
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,079
women in my practice

1055
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:21,519
um now and we we have to realize and

1056
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,599
this doesn't get discussed

1057
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,358
as often as i would like is that

1058
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,639
estrogen makes women a lot more

1059
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:30,000
sensitive to cannabis

1060
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,240
you know and mostly thc so our hormones

1061
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,119
interact with thc quite a quite a bit

1062
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,759
and our cycle

1063
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,599
can influence how how we feel and this

1064
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,839
was documented through researchers at

1065
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,838
washington state university

1066
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,679
they found that women experience most

1067
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:44,320
effects of thc when their estrogen is

1068
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,000
peaked

1069
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,760
right right when it peaked and beginning

1070
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,760
to fall so this happens

1071
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,359
at like about the day or two before you

1072
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,480
ovulate so day 12

1073
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:56,719
to day 14 or so and this

1074
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,639
this interaction makes us more sensitive

1075
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,199
to the compound in general

1076
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,159
but it also actually gives us more pain

1077
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,759
relieving effects

1078
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:07,920
right compared to to males but also

1079
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,160
we actually can develop more tolerance

1080
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,559
to the thc compared to men

1081
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,679
so for women i actually when they come

1082
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,838
into my office

1083
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,118
i will look at their cycle or non-cycle

1084
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:18,239
you know so i'll look at their estrogen

1085
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,960
progesterone levels

1086
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,679
lsh levels fsh levels and i will

1087
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,720
actually

1088
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:27,759
create a game plan and i will dose them

1089
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:29,199
based on their cycle so they take a

1090
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,520
little bit more or a little less

1091
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,519
depending on where they're at

1092
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,639
uh and it's important i mean you know

1093
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,519
we're we're not

1094
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,960
represented in studies uh you know as a

1095
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:41,280
you know as an ethnicity different

1096
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,679
minorities or even as a female

1097
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,359
which is unfortunate but i i do take

1098
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:45,919
that into account when i see female

1099
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:47,440
patients

1100
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,039
that's really great to hear that was

1101
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,240
exactly what where i was going to go

1102
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,358
next is

1103
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:56,239
um there's this like very little disgust

1104
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:59,838
issue in biomedical research in general

1105
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,879
that a lot of the way that we've come to

1106
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,679
think about

1107
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,200
uh pharmacology and physiology is based

1108
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,559
on research in men

1109
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:11,039
and it doesn't translate

1110
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,559
um you know i mean some does but you

1111
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:13,279
know obviously there are there are big

1112
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,078
differences

1113
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,040
and these hormonal differences drive all

1114
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,440
sorts of

1115
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,199
um nuanced differences in

1116
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,519
pharmacokinetics and things

1117
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,319
that um really needs to be talked about

1118
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:25,838
more i mean

1119
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,599
there's so many issues with biomedical

1120
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:29,119
research right now so this is one so the

1121
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,400
under representation

1122
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:35,440
um between um ethnic groups

1123
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,599
and and sexes and that sort of thing um

1124
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,880
but then also we have a reproducibility

1125
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,559
problem too so there's a lot of

1126
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,119
biomedical research that's been done

1127
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,880
that

1128
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,640
we're having trouble reproducing and um

1129
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,440
it's it's a great time to have a lot of

1130
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:52,480
humility i think when it comes to

1131
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,240
to medicine absolutely right yeah 100

1132
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,760
i'm so glad you said that i mean when

1133
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,279
you when we get sick

1134
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,880
you're going to take the same z pack as

1135
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,839
i am right

1136
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,440
right you know so why aren't we dosed

1137
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,838
differently based on our weight

1138
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,480
our ethnicity based on our metabolism

1139
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,480
right

1140
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,880
yeah exactly and um are there

1141
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,599
um i mean you just you just hit several

1142
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,920
of the big

1143
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,119
um ways that cannabis can affect women

1144
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,039
differently than men or

1145
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,838
really just depending on a person's

1146
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,320
hormonal levels regardless of how they

1147
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,880
identify

1148
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,400
are there any other big differences that

1149
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,559
you've noticed

1150
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,240
in how people react to cannabis

1151
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,320
differently that you think people should

1152
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,039
be aware about

1153
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,960
actually ethnicity is a big thing i've

1154
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,358
noticed in my clinical data that

1155
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,159
different ethnic groups um you know

1156
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,960
depending on

1157
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,078
genetic makeup um and where their

1158
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,280
ancestors are from

1159
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,079
will react differently to cannabinoid

1160
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,920
medicine

1161
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,400
so the hispanic population asian

1162
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,599
population seem much more sensitive

1163
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,119
to cannabinoids um and so i

1164
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,039
i mean it's interesting because i'm i'm

1165
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,280
looking at the data that i have

1166
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,279
and i i i would definitely want to

1167
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,400
utilize this set and figure out you know

1168
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,119
where

1169
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,519
or maybe maybe we can brainstorm offline

1170
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,240
yeah

1171
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:11,519
um but but really think about how this

1172
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:14,078
plant is working

1173
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:14,800
from you know a demographic point of

1174
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,440
view

1175
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,880
yeah i that's something that i have i

1176
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,800
don't know if i've heard anyone

1177
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,559
really bring much attention to that at

1178
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,800
all um so that's

1179
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,000
super super fascinating and something

1180
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,039
that um

1181
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,320
yeah we really need to look at and

1182
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:31,920
once again this is one of those things

1183
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,160
where cannabis sort of leads into these

1184
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,000
discussions about medicine broadly but

1185
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,440
you know this is research that needs to

1186
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,960
happen across the board

1187
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,639
um analyses of you know large data sets

1188
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,159
that clinicians have and try to

1189
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:45,838
understand how

1190
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,078
different people are reacting to things

1191
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:49,679
differently and how we can

1192
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,680
drive medicine towards a much more

1193
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,000
individualized targeted approach

1194
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,719
rather than how we've been operating

1195
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,480
since

1196
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,559
you know i don't know the 50s where we

1197
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,679
basically take

1198
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:06,000
averages of medical research and

1199
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:07,679
we apply therapies according to um

1200
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,280
sort of an average sample population

1201
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,879
that doesn't even exist in the world you

1202
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,880
know you're always dealing with people

1203
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,079
that are bringing unique things to the

1204
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,519
to the table um so that's yeah that's

1205
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,480
excellent to hear

1206
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,519
um when someone comes to you and they

1207
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,480
want to

1208
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:26,000
engage cannabis what are some of the

1209
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,079
things that you screen for

1210
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,760
that could be problematic like other

1211
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,280
like certain uh medical condition

1212
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,359
conditions they may have that wouldn't

1213
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,960
react favorably to cannabis or

1214
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,639
other medications you know

1215
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,720
contraindications you're worried about

1216
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:41,838
that sort of thing

1217
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:43,519
yeah so medications is a big thing um

1218
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,119
because most of the patients that come

1219
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:46,639
to me are on a lot of meds

1220
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,400
right because you've already tried all

1221
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,639
these different things and

1222
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,320
um all your specialists have tried to

1223
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,920
throw the kitchen sink at you

1224
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,079
you know so they they might be on

1225
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,400
antidepressants for chronic pain you

1226
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,640
know

1227
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,680
such as cymbalta for example something i

1228
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,078
see a lot

1229
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:02,719
and um you know patients are trying to

1230
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,920
get off

1231
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:06,559
of a lot of these medications so i don't

1232
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,318
recommend

1233
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:09,759
just going cold turkey and getting off

1234
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,000
of these medications because

1235
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,160
your body's biochemistry has changed

1236
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,239
your brain biochemistry has changed

1237
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:17,920
so if you've been on benzos

1238
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,199
antidepressants if you've been on these

1239
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,079
pain medications

1240
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,039
you know for your condition for a very

1241
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,880
long time

1242
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,480
you know just haphazardly adding

1243
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,599
cannabinoid medicine or even other

1244
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,480
nutraceuticals

1245
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,039
right other other supplements can be a

1246
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,079
really

1247
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:36,480
dangerous thing so i

1248
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,318
make sure that i look at the medication

1249
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,838
list cross-reference it

1250
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:44,880
and sometimes patients

1251
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,679
have to really wait and i start to wean

1252
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,000
patients off

1253
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:50,078
with their specialist so i don't i don't

1254
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,559
take patients off medication on my own i

1255
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,200
make sure to work with their md as well

1256
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,799
um and help them wean off the medication

1257
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,879
and then we fold in

1258
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,160
the cannabis medicine or some of the

1259
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,960
other integrative therapies

1260
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,920
very very carefully taking into account

1261
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,880
the withdrawals

1262
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,200
both physical and emotional withdrawal

1263
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,599
and

1264
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,639
sometimes we have to compound the

1265
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,920
medications

1266
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:15,279
so for instance um i'm trying to think

1267
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,599
of one

1268
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:23,040
that's actually really ambien is one

1269
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,880
let's see we have to sometimes compound

1270
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,559
the medication so they're taking it i

1271
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,880
mean you can only break the tablet so

1272
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,639
much

1273
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,400
right yeah before i just like used a

1274
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:32,078
powder yeah exactly

1275
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,160
so sometimes we'll compound into a

1276
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,440
liquid form and help them wean off like

1277
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,440
klonopin that's what i'm just

1278
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,838
thinking of klonopin can take patients

1279
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,318
one to two years to get off of

1280
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,199
so we'll we'll create it into a liquid

1281
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:45,279
formula

1282
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:46,239
with a compounding pharmacy and just

1283
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,920
drip by drip

1284
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,598
drip by drip and getting them off little

1285
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,240
by little as we fold in

1286
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,440
uh the cannabis medicine yeah and have

1287
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:57,919
you encountered

1288
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:01,679
um any examples of um

1289
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,599
adverse reactions between cannabis and

1290
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,960
someone's pharmaceuticals maybe even

1291
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,480
before they came to see you because they

1292
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,199
maybe didn't have that

1293
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,920
um advice at the time when they started

1294
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:12,399
trying it

1295
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,318
yeah yeah so so cannabinoids can work on

1296
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,480
you know your serotonin

1297
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,880
levels and if they're on other

1298
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,358
medications that also affect that

1299
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,880
patients will feel much more anxious

1300
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:23,598
patients might have increased panic

1301
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,920
attacks

1302
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,440
they might feel more restless um and

1303
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,119
just feel uneasy

1304
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,119
they always say i feel like i'm crawling

1305
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,160
out of my skin i did something wrong

1306
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,440
i took too much you know or they're not

1307
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:37,440
spacing it apart with

1308
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,880
other medications or supplements you

1309
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,480
know sometimes patients are on four or

1310
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,000
five different supplements as well that

1311
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,559
they think oh it's natural

1312
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,039
so i'll just take everything at once um

1313
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,358
and

1314
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,800
that's not a good idea either so so we

1315
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,039
really try and break it down for

1316
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,039
patients so it's much more manageable

1317
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:54,719
and cost-effective because that's a big

1318
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,279
thing as well as you know the

1319
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,959
cbd and cannabis is very expensive

1320
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,000
nutraceuticals are expensive then they

1321
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,240
have their

1322
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,519
prescription medications on top of that

1323
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,959
and then they want to do all these other

1324
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:06,400
therapies as well

1325
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,159
so we look at everything from a

1326
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,200
practical perspective yeah

1327
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,879
absolutely and what was your in

1328
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,559
changing gears a little bit here but

1329
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,838
what was your experience like

1330
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:19,440
going from california's medical cannabis

1331
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:21,039
system to new york's

1332
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,720
medical cannabis system when you moved

1333
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,880
what were the difference and what was

1334
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,039
that transition like

1335
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,920
well there's definitely pros and cons in

1336
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:30,880
california

1337
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,960
it was a free-for-all there was a

1338
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,640
dispensary on every corner

1339
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,519
uh more dispensaries in starbucks

1340
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,078
you know you can imagine so it was very

1341
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:42,079
difficult

1342
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,760
i had a few of my favorite dispensaries

1343
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,519
my preferred dispensaries where

1344
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,119
the staff was you know wonderful and

1345
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:49,358
they supported

1346
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,240
my patients throughout the process but

1347
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:52,078
in the beginning

1348
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:53,759
i would actually talk to these

1349
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,599
dispensaries and say okay my patient's

1350
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,359
going to come in give you a heads up

1351
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,800
you know without disclosing i mean i

1352
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:01,759
kept full you know um

1353
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,119
hipaa hipaa rules but you know giving

1354
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,880
them a heads up that my patients are

1355
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,440
coming and this is what we would like to

1356
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,920
try

1357
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,200
or not try and some of the really good

1358
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,920
dispensaries

1359
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:12,879
were very respectful of that and worked

1360
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,400
as a team

1361
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,400
some of them weren't and was just trying

1362
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,559
to push product and just move things off

1363
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,599
the shelf

1364
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,000
in new york it's very different in new

1365
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,880
york

1366
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,920
every dispensary has a pharmacist oh

1367
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,920
interesting

1368
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,240
every dispensary has a pharmacist and

1369
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,480
everything you pick up

1370
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,159
is logged into the prescription

1371
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,599
monitoring program

1372
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:37,598
and this is the same prescription

1373
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,720
monitoring program as if you saw your

1374
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,720
family practitioner

1375
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:42,480
and they prescribed medication for you

1376
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:45,358
like ambien

1377
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,960
or some pain meds they would log it in

1378
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:50,239
so when you go to

1379
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,000
cvs or walgreens to pick it up cvs and

1380
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:52,799
walgreens log in and sees that you have

1381
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,159
cannabis

1382
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,240
as well that you picked it up from the

1383
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,799
dispensary so we're all looking at the

1384
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,000
same

1385
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,440
database so that

1386
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,280
they know that you didn't pick up too

1387
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,639
much and the pharmacist at the

1388
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,760
dispensaries here in new york will say

1389
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,400
hey wait a minute

1390
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,800
you're on blood thinners you're on you

1391
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,480
know

1392
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,000
oxycontin and then you just picked up

1393
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,599
cannabis right

1394
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,358
there's some there's some polypharmacy

1395
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,400
going on here there might be some issues

1396
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:18,880
and they'll pick up the phone and

1397
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,039
they'll call me so there is some

1398
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,680
accountability and cross-reference

1399
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,440
so it is a very robust medical system in

1400
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:28,078
that sense

1401
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,200
but it's very cross cost prohibitive

1402
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,519
here in new york

1403
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:33,118
it's about i would say two to three

1404
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:36,159
times the price is california

1405
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,640
easily yeah and that's

1406
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:39,519
such a shame when you have you know some

1407
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,118
of these patients

1408
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:45,199
being um children that are already on

1409
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,440
you know sometimes really expensive

1410
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:50,879
medications or like the elderly

1411
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,519
and the poor you know that um

1412
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,240
are already struggling to pay for for

1413
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:56,800
health care

1414
00:45:54,239 --> 00:46:00,479
and then to have something like this

1415
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,720
that theoretically could be really cheap

1416
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,599
but you know making that less accessible

1417
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,799
that's

1418
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,800
disappointing but it is exciting to

1419
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,079
hear about a medical system that where

1420
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,519
they're treating

1421
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,079
cannabis just like any other medicine or

1422
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,920
drug

1423
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:19,599
you know and that there's that shared um

1424
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,680
information and that you can catch

1425
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,519
things like that that there's um

1426
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:25,440
it's a more precautionary approach i

1427
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:29,358
guess um

1428
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,760
and that's that's um exciting to see

1429
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:32,400
i'm i'm not familiar with new york's

1430
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,040
cannabis

1431
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,639
laws in general so what are the

1432
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,199
conditions that new york

1433
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,879
um will approve somebody for for medical

1434
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,519
cannabis

1435
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,559
right so there's epilepsy uh there's

1436
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:46,400
ptsd

1437
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,159
chronic pain which is a you know big

1438
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,639
umbrella term and that chronic pain

1439
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:50,559
could

1440
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,759
you know incorporate many different

1441
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,799
disease states

1442
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,280
als parkinson's irritable bowel disease

1443
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,920
you know which is crohn's colitis etc

1444
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,960
um also substance abuse actually added

1445
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,559
substance abuse

1446
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,559
so patients that are trying to wean off

1447
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,119
opiates are qualified

1448
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:09,119
as well um there's a there's a good

1449
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,640
amount autism is not on there

1450
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,640
um no um

1451
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,920
but uh you know patients with chronic

1452
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,318
pain that could be migraine

1453
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,240
that could be pelvic pain um that could

1454
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:23,279
be you know arthritis

1455
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:25,279
and like for example the cost going back

1456
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,640
to cost i have a patient who

1457
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:32,880
is seven and he has seizures

1458
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:35,358
he had about 100 seizures easily a day

1459
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,240
and he is controlled now with cannabis

1460
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:38,639
the seizures

1461
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:41,439
maybe he has a handful a month now but

1462
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:43,039
they spend about three grand a month

1463
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,639
yeah they spend about three grand a

1464
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:48,239
month on the on cannabis

1465
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:53,039
wow gee whiz and

1466
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:56,479
what's your experience been regarding um

1467
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:57,759
the in getting more into like the more

1468
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,000
modern work that you're doing where

1469
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,880
you've

1470
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,159
actually got this data but um so there's

1471
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,480
this debate around

1472
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,399
you know isolated cannabinoids versus

1473
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,079
quote unquote broad spectrum versus full

1474
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,280
spectrum which these terms aren't even

1475
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,720
really defined

1476
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,960
so depending on who you talk to they

1477
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:16,000
mean different things but

1478
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,000
have you had any um

1479
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,519
have you noticed anything any trends

1480
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,760
between different

1481
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:22,960
types of cannabis products and their

1482
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,359
efficacy

1483
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,358
and sort of the dosaging and stuff and

1484
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:29,358
the reason i ask is because i've had

1485
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:30,400
some other clinicians tell me that from

1486
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:32,400
their experience

1487
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,318
they feel that they're able to use lower

1488
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,400
dosages and get

1489
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,318
fewer negative side effects with

1490
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,400
cannabis products that have a broader

1491
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:41,759
phytochemical diversity in them versus

1492
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,160
those that are very

1493
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,760
you know either isolated or like you

1494
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:46,000
have you know distillates and stuff that

1495
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,079
have

1496
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,440
you know a very narrow range of of

1497
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,640
chemistry in them do you have

1498
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:56,480
any thoughts on that yeah so

1499
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:59,759
for me um of course full spectrum

1500
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:02,000
um seems to get a little more mileage

1501
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,440
i find that the efficacy of full

1502
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,719
spectrum

1503
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:09,200
is a lot it goes a longer way

1504
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:10,399
for patients and they spend actually

1505
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:13,838
less

1506
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:17,358
money because they need less

1507
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:18,318
over time i think with isolates patients

1508
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:21,598
tend to

1509
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:23,279
need a little bit more um and

1510
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,200
you know it's going back to that single

1511
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,200
molecule right so

1512
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:28,719
so you're pulling you know you're

1513
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:30,960
pulling this out of the

1514
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,639
the plant the full plant and taking it

1515
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,199
out of context

1516
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:37,920
so you may not get all the benefits um

1517
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:40,719
but i can see why isolates are used in

1518
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,760
you know food and beverage things like

1519
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:45,118
that for taste

1520
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,160
or if it's harder to standardize a full

1521
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,640
spectrum right

1522
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:49,440
uh plant right so you know the same

1523
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:52,558
quinovar

1524
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,039
in florida will look different than

1525
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,240
that seed in new york or california

1526
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:57,199
right you're just not going to get the

1527
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:01,358
same thing

1528
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:04,078
so i can see why um

1529
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:05,838
certain industry professionals are more

1530
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,960
comfortable with isolates

1531
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:12,000
but i think full spectrum um

1532
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,318
full spectrum is better yeah yeah

1533
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,079
well you're uh another one to the list

1534
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:17,039
pretty much every clinician i've talked

1535
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,039
to has

1536
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,719
has shared the same thing i'm yet to

1537
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:24,838
find anybody that

1538
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:27,838
um has had a more positive experience

1539
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:30,000
um with isolated cannabinoids

1540
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,358
than full spectrum well i think we can

1541
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,920
all agree that we just need more

1542
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:34,159
research

1543
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,119
right and this research really needs to

1544
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:36,799
focus on

1545
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,240
the fundamental understanding of what's

1546
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,160
going on with the whole plan

1547
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:41,759
right and not just selecting out these

1548
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:45,358
individual molecules

1549
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,160
like cbg cbs you know like like we know

1550
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,199
what we're doing

1551
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:51,199
because really we don't so and and the

1552
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:54,719
thing is we're still looking at this

1553
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:56,480
field from a disease target kill model

1554
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,159
exactly that's the thing allopathic

1555
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,358
we're still looking at this from this

1556
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:01,920
allopathic

1557
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:04,318
uh reductive approach uh which is

1558
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,400
separating you know disease into parts

1559
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:08,000
right we're still separating it we feel

1560
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,000
good about separating things by

1561
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,119
element and element and component when

1562
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,760
we see the doctor

1563
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,160
you're going to your endocrinologist and

1564
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,319
then

1565
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:17,838
your nephrol you know nephrologist and

1566
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:19,279
your neurologist and all these doctors

1567
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:20,719
are not talking to each other

1568
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,280
because they're operating in separate

1569
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,959
silos so it's it's the same thing with

1570
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,119
cannabinoid medicine

1571
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,000
and it's a disservice you know really

1572
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,400
there's this whole

1573
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,760
universe of regenerative medicine

1574
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,519
nutritional medicine

1575
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,520
preventative integrative medicine and

1576
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:38,239
we're not talking about that

1577
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:39,440
yeah no absolutely and and this um sort

1578
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:41,759
of segues into

1579
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,920
a really broad topic that i kind of

1580
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,040
wanted to talk to you about is just

1581
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,519
like these um plant-based or even fungal

1582
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:50,800
based

1583
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:52,559
medicines in general in your mind

1584
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,640
sort of stepping back and looking at

1585
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,559
health care as a whole

1586
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:58,239
how do you conceptualize medicinal

1587
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:01,119
plants and those sort of things

1588
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:02,558
um and maybe even um to an extent to

1589
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,280
certain like dietary supplements and

1590
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,359
stuff that are

1591
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,720
you know basically medicinal some of

1592
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:08,558
them medicinal plants that are just kind

1593
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,799
of ground up and capsulized but

1594
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,400
um how does that fit in your mind of the

1595
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,318
whole you know picture of healthcare

1596
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,880
broadly

1597
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:19,039
well it's a it goes back to what kevin

1598
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,838
spellman talked about in systems biology

1599
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:21,838
approach

1600
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:22,960
right this is really again a wake-up

1601
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:24,880
care to our

1602
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,318
our health system when we look at

1603
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,960
evidence-based medicine

1604
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:29,838
you know it really over emphasizes

1605
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,039
randomized

1606
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:35,039
double-blind clinical control trials

1607
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:37,440
it looks as it as it's like the final

1608
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:39,119
arbiter of clinical decision-making

1609
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,599
but when you look at americans i mean

1610
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:44,240
more than 40 percent of us belong to

1611
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,318
again a racial or ethnic minority so

1612
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,399
what are these differences in genomes

1613
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:50,318
you know how do we take a closer look at

1614
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,720
these these patients and how are they

1615
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:54,079
participating in these clinical trials

1616
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:55,919
um there's actually something that's

1617
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,400
really interesting i want to bring up

1618
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,358
the nih actually has something i'll send

1619
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,000
you the link

1620
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:03,119
it's called all of us research program

1621
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,599
and it talks about

1622
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,880
precision medicine and i think this is

1623
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,079
the future of medicine

1624
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:13,119
it's looking at all of us

1625
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,680
to participate into this database

1626
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,920
if you will and you it's it's basically

1627
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:20,879
contributing your blood tests

1628
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,639
your urine saliva test dna tests and

1629
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,318
they're looking at this database to

1630
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:26,400
start looking at how do we get

1631
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:27,838
more precise medicine you know going

1632
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,318
back to that zpac

1633
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:32,318
analogy you know why when you get

1634
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:33,039
bronchitis or you get a cold at you know

1635
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:34,800
the

1636
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,159
flu why are you going to take the same z

1637
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,200
pack as i'm going to take

1638
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:40,960
you know it might not work well and i

1639
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,159
think this is where plant medicine

1640
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:47,119
can really take hold as well because

1641
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:48,879
precision medicine can take into account

1642
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,160
plant-based medicine and holistic

1643
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,480
healing

1644
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:53,279
yeah absolutely and something i'd like

1645
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,800
to see

1646
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,400
from you know sort of maybe it that

1647
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,680
would come from the fda but

1648
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,559
some sort of better way of

1649
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:05,440
um studying in a sophisticated clinical

1650
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,880
way

1651
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,760
how medicinal plants um can be utilized

1652
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,079
in

1653
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,520
you know any particular sort of like

1654
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:16,559
treatment modality and you know

1655
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:18,800
in other countries in some countries um

1656
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,839
they have you know a specific sort of

1657
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,200
pathway

1658
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:26,159
that you could get um natural products

1659
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:26,480
uh approved as medicines um and it's

1660
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:29,039
it's

1661
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,838
a lot harder in the united states i

1662
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:31,759
don't know that i would say it's

1663
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:32,078
impossible but it is very difficult and

1664
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,559
it

1665
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,240
costs a lot of money and a lot of time

1666
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,319
and because of that it's not worth it

1667
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:41,199
for a lot of companies to try to

1668
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:42,558
you know create some basic standardized

1669
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:43,759
botanical extract

1670
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,319
and try to get that approved as a

1671
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,240
medicine when they could go further and

1672
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:50,719
get some isolated compounds create a

1673
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:52,318
very unique formulation that has a much

1674
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:54,159
stronger patent on it

1675
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:55,920
you know that then they can kind of run

1676
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:59,039
with for 10 years or whatever

1677
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,798
um once they get exactly exactly there's

1678
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:03,199
just there's not enough studies on

1679
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,798
on plant pharmacogenetics yeah you know

1680
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:07,118
we just we need to look at

1681
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:08,960
you know really genomics more too i mean

1682
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,720
for one big thing that i see

1683
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,318
you know in my clinic is that african

1684
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:14,239
americans and

1685
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:16,318
puerto ricans for example they don't

1686
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:18,719
respond well to common asthma

1687
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:19,599
asthma controller medications as well as

1688
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,879
as other

1689
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,798
other um ethnic groups so

1690
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,318
this might you know this is something we

1691
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:28,798
might think about when we talk about

1692
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:30,480
plant pharmacogenetics you know maybe

1693
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:32,880
there's something in the genome

1694
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,719
um that you know we we need to take into

1695
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,440
account so we don't over prescribe

1696
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:39,358
exactly yeah so that that is the that's

1697
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,400
the future of medicine yeah it's looking

1698
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:42,798
at these different

1699
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,480
i mean we we don't know anything right

1700
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,960
and we're acting like we know

1701
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,240
yeah yep yep well there's that you know

1702
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,159
that classic um

1703
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:51,279
idea that i try to bring up time and

1704
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:53,358
time again but

1705
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,559
you know uh the more you learn and the

1706
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:56,719
more you study

1707
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:59,519
ideally what happens is you start to

1708
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:02,239
learn how much you don't know

1709
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:03,358
you know and and it and that's to me

1710
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:06,479
that's what wisdom is

1711
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:09,598
is like recognizing you know your own

1712
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,039
um sort of boundaries and and

1713
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,119
recognizing that there is

1714
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:16,719
you know kevin put it well this dark

1715
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:19,119
information dark data dark pharmacology

1716
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:20,558
that we just don't understand and and

1717
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,519
looking at studies

1718
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:25,040
you know in vitro or even you know

1719
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:27,119
rodent in vivo models

1720
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:28,798
they just they don't give us the full

1721
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,039
picture and

1722
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:31,920
something so an interview i released

1723
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,719
recently with

1724
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,000
um jason miller he's a traditional

1725
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:37,838
chinese medicine

1726
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,358
practitioner he was talking about the

1727
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:42,159
difference between

1728
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:43,119
efficacy and effectiveness research and

1729
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:44,399
you know that

1730
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,480
going to something you said just a

1731
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,680
little bit ago that most research is

1732
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,159
targeted on

1733
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:52,159
uh disease what drug is going to

1734
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:55,838
influence a disease in a particular way

1735
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:58,159
not what um treatment modalities

1736
00:56:55,838 --> 00:57:00,318
as a whole might lead to a better

1737
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:02,639
outcome for a person

1738
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:03,759
um because yeah you might knock out that

1739
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:06,159
disease but what's going to be the

1740
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,559
consequence for that person's well-being

1741
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:09,838
you know then and you know long into the

1742
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,519
future and everything and

1743
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:12,960
that was something i really resonated

1744
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:15,759
with when he said that is

1745
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,358
absolutely like our just our focus has

1746
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,839
been we've had such an extreme tunnel

1747
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:21,039
vision

1748
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:24,838
on disease and not overall

1749
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:27,199
patient care and wellness um in its

1750
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:28,798
totality exactly there's no

1751
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:30,798
talk about prevention you know what

1752
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:31,599
about the terrain that's breeding the

1753
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:34,159
disease

1754
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,880
you know why is it that certain you know

1755
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,039
there's certain

1756
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,880
people that will be more prone to cancer

1757
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:41,358
than others right

1758
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,798
so we we need to look at um medicine

1759
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:44,558
from this preventative

1760
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:46,798
perspective yeah and we don't we don't

1761
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:49,359
talk about that in in healthcare because

1762
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:51,358
there's no time you know my colleagues

1763
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:52,318
are seeing 30 patients a day it's a

1764
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:53,920
factory

1765
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:56,239
you know maybe you have five minutes

1766
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,599
with your doctor and um you can't get

1767
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,879
all your questions in and you're going

1768
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,559
to have to wait until the next visit

1769
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,559
which is going to be two months from now

1770
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,400
well yeah and i know just from my own

1771
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,079
experience that i'll have questions

1772
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,119
thought of that i want to ask my doctor

1773
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,200
when i go in

1774
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,559
and then in the moment when they say so

1775
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:11,838
do you have any other questions i'm like

1776
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,640
uh

1777
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:16,000
i i guess not i don't remember you know

1778
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:17,598
and then you get home and you're like

1779
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,480
dang i wish i would have asked this and

1780
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,480
that and

1781
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,159
you know that's such a common experience

1782
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,000
i think for so many people and

1783
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:26,318
you know when you're in the room and you

1784
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,599
know maybe the physician's sharing some

1785
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:29,599
new information with you and so you're

1786
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,318
processing that and trying to remember

1787
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,760
you know

1788
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:34,000
it's just it's hard when you've only

1789
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,640
yeah i got like 10 minutes maybe a face

1790
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,760
time and

1791
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:40,798
and then yeah that's it it's it's

1792
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:43,839
yeah it's really really hard

1793
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:47,440
um going back to

1794
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:49,199
um thinking about your interactions with

1795
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,639
patients when they're coming in and kind

1796
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:51,519
of getting on their purse their

1797
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:52,960
perspective

1798
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,599
what are some of the most common

1799
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,639
questions that you receive from patients

1800
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:00,318
um about cannabis and um and this leads

1801
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:02,078
into another question i have about

1802
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:03,838
um sort of common misconceptions well

1803
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,039
we'll start just with sort of the common

1804
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:09,199
questions you receive about cannabis

1805
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:10,239
um the biggest thing is most patients

1806
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:11,759
wanting to come in is

1807
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:14,159
wanting to use them you know throughout

1808
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,680
the day and at night as well

1809
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:17,519
they want to be able to use something

1810
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:19,279
without being impaired right

1811
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:21,119
um i think that's the biggest thing you

1812
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,798
know everyone is working everyone's

1813
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,400
you know they might not have a nine to

1814
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:24,880
five but they're doing stuff at home

1815
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,440
they're

1816
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,119
you know they're taking care of their

1817
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,798
own parents or their children

1818
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:34,160
um or friends so it's impairment

1819
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:35,838
that's the thing they come in they say

1820
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:37,920
okay i need something

1821
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:39,279
for x y and z but i don't want to be

1822
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,000
impaired yeah

1823
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,960
and have you identified um sort of some

1824
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,880
ideal

1825
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:50,639
cbd thc ratios that help people avoid

1826
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:55,358
feeling impaired most of patients that

1827
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:59,118
take cbd or cbd dominant

1828
00:59:55,358 --> 01:00:01,519
formula are not impaired but there are

1829
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,318
patients that do take cbd that feel

1830
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:04,239
impaired

1831
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:05,679
um and that's usually the same patients

1832
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:09,279
that are sensitive to

1833
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:11,199
you know advil for example um and so

1834
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,119
i'll you know just have them switch and

1835
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:13,759
have them take it you know during the

1836
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,240
evening

1837
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,760
but microdosing is the biggest thing you

1838
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:19,598
know if you're taking

1839
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,799
cannabinoid medicine maybe the first

1840
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,559
couple of weeks you

1841
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:24,880
feel different you might feel a little

1842
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,640
bit groggier but over time your body

1843
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,440
gets used to it

1844
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:29,838
and you feel less of those side effects

1845
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,679
yeah

1846
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:35,519
yeah exactly and so leading into the

1847
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:37,118
next question what are some of the most

1848
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:39,920
common misconceptions

1849
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,559
that sometimes you have to confront when

1850
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,639
either

1851
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,760
either from patients that come in and

1852
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,279
sort of have a

1853
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,680
rough understanding and maybe it's not

1854
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,680
quite aligned with reality or from your

1855
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:51,919
colleagues potentially that have

1856
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,440
misconceptions about cannabis and it's

1857
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,920
in its role in cannabis what are some of

1858
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,519
those

1859
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:59,838
that you run into a lot of

1860
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:01,519
i think with all the hype and uh you

1861
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:02,960
know this is really unprecedented

1862
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:04,798
there's nothing in the world that's

1863
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,159
taken you know both recreationally and

1864
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:08,798
medicinally yeah

1865
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:10,558
so i think a lot of patients come in

1866
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,318
thinking this is going to be it

1867
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,720
this is going to be the end-all be-all

1868
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:16,639
and they have really high expectations

1869
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:18,159
of it working because of everything

1870
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:20,000
they've read online and

1871
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:21,598
you know my neighbor took it and she's

1872
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
free of cancer now

1873
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:26,000
um or you know it stops the parkinson

1874
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,480
tremors so it must be able to stop my

1875
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,920
fibromyalgia pain too

1876
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,639
so um it doesn't work for everything and

1877
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,519
everyone

1878
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:36,558
it's not that silver bullet you really

1879
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:39,599
have to do

1880
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:42,000
other things in combination with

1881
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,519
the cannabinoid medicine yeah yeah

1882
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,798
absolutely and would you say that's

1883
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:46,400
maybe

1884
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:49,039
kind of one of the big things that you

1885
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,480
wish everyone knew about cannabis before

1886
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:53,519
engaging it is that it's

1887
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:56,639
not a silver bullet um absolutely

1888
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:57,679
absolutely and you might not find um one

1889
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:00,000
product will work

1890
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:00,798
you know forever so i usually have

1891
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,400
patients

1892
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:03,920
like pick you know two to three

1893
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,000
different favorite

1894
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,240
cannabis products that work or close to

1895
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,798
working and they switch off

1896
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:12,558
you know every quarter because our body

1897
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:14,559
gets sensitized to it

1898
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:16,480
you know and i always compare this to

1899
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:18,400
allergy medication you might find that

1900
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,400
zyrtec works for one season and then you

1901
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,400
got to switch over to claritin

1902
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,200
um and same thing with your you know

1903
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,039
echinacea or vitamin c or your magnesium

1904
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:28,318
you need to take you know take a break

1905
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,960
and switch off

1906
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:33,119
um the good thing about um you know our

1907
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,519
endocannabinoid system is that we can

1908
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,798
exercise and increase our anamide levels

1909
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:39,358
we can get acupuncture

1910
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:40,400
massage and our anandamide levels will

1911
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:41,838
increase

1912
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,160
so there are different things that we

1913
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:47,199
can do with cannabinoid medicine

1914
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:50,318
yeah safely yeah absolutely

1915
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:50,318
and um

1916
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,920
what is something throughout your

1917
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:58,880
experience with patients

1918
01:02:53,920 --> 01:03:00,559
that has surprised you either an outcome

1919
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,000
or however you want to think about that

1920
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:05,119
question but you know you've been doing

1921
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,719
this a while now do you have any

1922
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:09,599
examples of some things that went

1923
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:11,598
differently than you expected or

1924
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,280
that an outcome came about that you know

1925
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:15,680
you really learned a lot from that kind

1926
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:18,559
of surprised you

1927
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:19,759
what's what's really surprising and um

1928
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:23,280
really refreshing

1929
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,760
is that patients that might not have

1930
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,640
been

1931
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,599
into holistic or integrative medicine

1932
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:31,118
when they try

1933
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,119
cannabis and it works

1934
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,519
it's really empowering for them you know

1935
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,760
for the first time they feel like

1936
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,599
i can take control of my health like i

1937
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,079
can have this conversation

1938
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,440
where um it does a little bit and then i

1939
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,359
can do other things

1940
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,079
and it really opens their mind yeah i

1941
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:48,719
think for integrative medicine and plant

1942
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,160
medicine

1943
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:51,679
and these are you know patients that

1944
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,199
have been on you know maybe 10

1945
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,118
medications their whole life

1946
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:57,038
and and keep going back to the doctor

1947
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:57,599
and says okay yes i will take this new

1948
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:59,520
med

1949
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,200
oh you want another medication yes and

1950
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:04,480
they're very compliant

1951
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:06,798
and obedient but when they've had enough

1952
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,400
and they've tried cannabis and it works

1953
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:09,838
and they start to get off the other

1954
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,400
medications

1955
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:13,038
they find that very empowering they find

1956
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,358
that like

1957
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:16,960
oh my god like i don't i don't have to

1958
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,358
rely on pharmaceuticals

1959
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,838
you know having that conversation about

1960
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:24,159
nutrition and exercise

1961
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:24,960
is very empowering because they don't

1962
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:28,078
have to

1963
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:31,119
rely on going to the md and

1964
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:34,000
writing that next script yeah yeah and

1965
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:35,838
that's that's something that um has been

1966
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,639
really exciting for me too on the sort

1967
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:39,440
of the educator

1968
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:40,000
side is seeing you know when i teach

1969
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,720
somebody

1970
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,559
about uh the cannabis plant and the

1971
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:48,318
chemistry how it affects the body

1972
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:50,319
all these sort of things and um and then

1973
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:51,759
i can use that as a stepping stone to

1974
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:53,599
say oh and then there's these other

1975
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,200
plants that have these similar compounds

1976
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,039
and act similarly and

1977
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:58,639
you know then it's like whoa i didn't

1978
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:01,839
realize you know that

1979
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:03,118
echinacea has these um alkalamides that

1980
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:03,679
you know interact the endocannabinoid

1981
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,519
system and

1982
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:07,519
turkey tell mushrooms the you know

1983
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:07,759
polysaccharide peptide is interacting

1984
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:09,920
with

1985
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,760
and flavonoids in general a lot of them

1986
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,720
are you know tugging on that ecs

1987
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,559
and um you know that uh beta-carotelline

1988
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:17,838
which is in so many plant oils

1989
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,440
uh you know black pepper is the most

1990
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:20,078
common one that gets talked about but

1991
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,079
like oh

1992
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:24,079
that's you know now sort of being

1993
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:27,599
thought of as a cannabinoid you know

1994
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:30,640
it just opens uh this doorway

1995
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:33,760
into appreciating

1996
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:36,078
food and medicinal plants in a totally

1997
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,760
different way that for whatever reason

1998
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,440
they just weren't able to you know there

1999
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,039
was sort of this invisible wall that

2000
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,318
they couldn't get past

2001
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:47,200
to kind of see how very real

2002
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:48,719
all of all of those you know dynamics

2003
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:51,118
are

2004
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:53,118
and that's that's something that gives

2005
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,160
me a lot of fulfillment as an educator

2006
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,920
is like yes like

2007
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:58,399
you're going beyond cannabis now and

2008
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,159
that's i i've mentioned before that

2009
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,318
you know this podcast and and the work

2010
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:05,118
that i do it's really a trojan horse

2011
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:05,519
to you know talk about these other areas

2012
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:08,640
of

2013
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:09,920
of health and wellness and and i i also

2014
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:11,598
follow that up by saying i'm not the

2015
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,400
best example of someone taking care of

2016
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:14,798
their health

2017
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,838
i i do what i can but there's plenty i'm

2018
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:18,400
deficient on

2019
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:19,199
so i have the educator syndrome of like

2020
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,160
do as i say

2021
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:24,399

yeah it is yeah i'll teach someone about

2024
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:30,160
medical plants and it's like all right

2025
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:31,358
i'm running low on time gotta go grab

2026
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:34,318
some fast food

2027
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:35,838
um believe me i was at shake shack with

2028
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:37,440
my kids the other day and i saw a

2029
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:39,599
patient i was like oh my god i gotta

2030
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:42,480
hide

2031
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,680
exactly i'm guilty i know right we're

2032
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,400
all human

2033
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:47,519
there's only so much we can do but but

2034
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,318
exactly and

2035
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:52,719
you're right you're right and it is it's

2036
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:55,279
exciting it's exciting to see

2037
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:57,519
when uh people can connect those dots

2038
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,359
and start to see

2039
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,038
you know coming all the way back around

2040
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:01,920
to like this integrative medicine

2041
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:05,200
approach to

2042
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:07,838
see their movement and their diet

2043
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:09,919
and supplements and you know the tea

2044
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:11,119
they drink all of these things as being

2045
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,880
part of

2046
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:16,480
healthcare and um is something i've

2047
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,400
mentioned before in another interview

2048
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,798
but you know we

2049
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,838
at least it seems like it's changing now

2050
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:25,440
and we talked about this

2051
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:27,038
um earlier that a lot of times we grow

2052
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,240
up thinking that

2053
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:31,280
um you know you eat food stay alive you

2054
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:33,199
take supplements if you have a

2055
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,240
nutritional deficiency of some sort and

2056
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:36,798
you take drugs

2057
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:38,879
to get better from illness and that's

2058
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:42,480
such a weird broken

2059
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,920
model um that's it's going to take time

2060
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,440
culturally for us to kind of you know

2061
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,400
get past that but i know as a kid that's

2062
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,720
what i

2063
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,880
sort of absorbed you know from what i

2064
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:52,480
was taught and exposed to

2065
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:55,838
um and then i got older and i was like

2066
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:58,318
dang okay this is all totally

2067
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:59,920
right well what the great thing is that

2068
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:03,358
you have platforms like this

2069
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,318
to educate and to reach um so so many so

2070
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:06,239
many people

2071
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:08,079
and there's wonderful practitioners

2072
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:09,358
ancillary practitioners i mean you have

2073
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:12,240
jana champaign

2074
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:13,119
epigenetics you know nurse practitioners

2075
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:16,079
nurses

2076
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:17,520
health coaches chiropractors naturopaths

2077
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:19,920
ayurvedic medicine

2078
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,640
um you know plant you know plant uh

2079
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,560
specialist

2080
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,719
you know look at calvin oh my gosh he

2081
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,520
knows a lot more than your normal md

2082
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:28,480
yeah yeah so you don't always have to go

2083
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,679
to your md

2084
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,519
all the time i mean there's all these

2085
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,319
great resources that are at your

2086
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,000
fingertips

2087
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:38,798
right yeah yeah exactly and i guess um

2088
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,479
so to get into another question i wanted

2089
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:42,719
to ask you is on those

2090
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:44,479
that topic of resources um what are some

2091
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:48,000
of your preferred

2092
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:52,158
learning resources regarding cannabis

2093
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:55,279
oh my goodness well i have

2094
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:57,519
i'm this resource oh my gosh it make me

2095
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,520
blush

2096
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,119
um there's there's some really great

2097
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,920
resources out there um

2098
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:05,198
it's the the also the thing is there's

2099
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:08,239
also misinformation

2100
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:09,919
right so a lot of a lot of cut and paste

2101
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:12,000
yeah you know we're sort of echoing the

2102
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,279
same thing um but there's there's some

2103
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,679
really great resources

2104
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:16,880
um i i'll i'll send you a link and maybe

2105
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,039
you can put it in your show now

2106
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,640
absolutely yeah that'd be great that's

2107
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:22,560
something i always try to tease out of

2108
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,480
my guests to try to understand what you

2109
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,480
found most valuable and try to connect

2110
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:30,000
people to that that'd be great

2111
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:32,479
um and now taking a step back

2112
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,640
and looking at sort of cannabis science

2113
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:38,238
and cannabis research as a whole

2114
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:40,640
um what sort of interests you the most

2115
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:44,158
and what do you hope to see from the

2116
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:48,239
future of cannabis research

2117
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:52,399
oh my goodness that is a huge question

2118
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:53,919
i mean for i mean the thing about

2119
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:56,319
the thing about research especially for

2120
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,239
plant medicine is that it and not

2121
01:09:56,319 --> 01:10:00,479
everything is going to fit into a box

2122
01:09:58,238 --> 01:10:03,359
and i just had this conversation with

2123
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:06,399
kevin a couple of weeks ago

2124
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:07,920
and we're trying i mean the thing about

2125
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:10,158
i mean that's the thing about research

2126
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,520
is that research has to be double-blind

2127
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:12,960
right research has to be random

2128
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,640
controlled and then what are you going

2129
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,880
to make of a plant that has

2130
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,400
different compounds that you can't

2131
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,480
standardize

2132
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:21,599
so it's almost like mother nature is

2133
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:25,119
laughing at us right

2134
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,320
yeah yeah right i i mean i i

2135
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:28,158
and then you look at the different

2136
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:30,000
receptors there's i

2137
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:31,759
there's a really great receptor map that

2138
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,279
i use in my presentations

2139
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:38,000
of the ecs and how uh different

2140
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:38,719
different phytocannabinoids affect and

2141
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,560
there's just

2142
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:42,840
it's just scattered everywhere i mean

2143
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,320
you can't even it's like we're we're a

2144
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,000
blip yes

2145
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:47,599
there's there's no way to wrap your head

2146
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,600
around it and that goes back to

2147
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,039
dark pharmacology i mean look think

2148
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,640
about plant medicine

2149
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:54,238
there's there's no way to wrap your head

2150
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:58,159
around this research and that's why

2151
01:10:54,238 --> 01:11:03,119
i i um talked about that nih

2152
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:06,399
platform because we if we can contribute

2153
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:09,519
the different information the genomics

2154
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:11,519
you know our blood our urine our dna

2155
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,120
we can really look at precision medicine

2156
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,800
individualized medicine

2157
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:16,960
and that's not what we have right now

2158
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:19,279
yeah yeah and it makes me wonder

2159
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,319
you know if we're in this situation

2160
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:22,719
where

2161
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,599
we're sort of like a bacteria trying to

2162
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:27,359
understand

2163
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:29,199
a human you know like there's this um

2164
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:30,880
barrier to understanding that you can

2165
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:32,238
just like really never get across and it

2166
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,079
makes me wonder if

2167
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:36,079
and i mean i know to an extent this is

2168
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:37,359
true that you know the role of ai and

2169
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:40,319
machine learning is going to become

2170
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:43,759
really invaluable to help us

2171
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:44,880
try to extend that sort of boundary that

2172
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,840
we have to work with because you're

2173
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,079
right like

2174
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,159
there's so much data so much information

2175
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:51,600
there's no one human brain that's going

2176
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:54,559
to be able to

2177
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,079
synthesize all of that and digest it and

2178
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,320
and then work with it

2179
01:11:56,079 --> 01:12:00,000
um it's i think it's going to take some

2180
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:02,000
help um from something

2181
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,079
beyond what what we're capable of and

2182
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,840
maybe that's a a good role for ai and

2183
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:08,479
healthcare is like this nih

2184
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:11,199
you know data gathering um initiative to

2185
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:13,519
get all this data together in one place

2186
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:15,359
where it can be you know manipulated and

2187
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,440
analyzed and everything and then maybe

2188
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:20,238
we sick the ai bots on it

2189
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:20,799
and then try to figure out what wisdom

2190
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:23,198
they can

2191
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,920
pull out of it and and teach us um

2192
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:25,678
because

2193
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,840
otherwise i mean can you imagine how

2194
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,600
much time it just time alone

2195
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,360
not much you know i don't know if you're

2196
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,800
like me like any study i read

2197
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:34,399
you know you've got to read it multiple

2198
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,239
times and try to like

2199
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:38,319
understand the pieces you missed and how

2200
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:40,319
things fit together and you know

2201
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:41,599
um so just the time alone is an

2202
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:44,799
impossible feat for

2203
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:46,800
you know anyone to overcome exactly and

2204
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,679
i mean the important thing also to know

2205
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,000
as we scale up ai is that you know we

2206
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,000
can't

2207
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,679
simply base it on data either yeah you

2208
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,920
know right so there there's a

2209
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:57,440
there's a sweet spot and how do we use

2210
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,800
ai successfully

2211
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:00,719
right so we're not you know so that

2212
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,840
we're not looking at false correlations

2213
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:04,079
yes but we're really trying to

2214
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,480
understand what's happening behind it so

2215
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:06,640
i think

2216
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:07,678
um i think there's i think that's the

2217
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,600
future

2218
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:11,199
yeah yeah i know i that's such a good

2219
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,360
point to bring up there

2220
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:15,198
there are things to our human experience

2221
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:18,158
that we're not going to be able to

2222
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:18,559
quantify that an ai is going to be able

2223
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:21,119
to

2224
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,560
to pick from so finding that blend and

2225
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:24,640
maybe that's when we just upload our

2226
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:28,000
consciousnesses into

2227
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:29,760
oh yeah so we can make the ultimate

2228
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,359
doctors

2229
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,360
but yeah absolutely there's there's a

2230
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:35,198
balance there for sure and there are

2231
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:38,238
things to our experience and

2232
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:39,759
um wisdom and things uh that you know ai

2233
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:42,879
is not going to be able to overcome

2234
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,640
so yeah absolutely well

2235
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,239
um i don't want to keep you too much

2236
