00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:12,979
[Music]

2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,449
my name is Michael Steinman's and I'm

3
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:24,539
one of the co-founders and CEOs of flow

4
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,149
Khanna and I'm here today to tell you

5
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,528
three things first I wanna start off and

6
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:30,778
tell you a little bit about flow kana in

7
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,579
our story then second I want to discuss

8
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:35,609
the incredible opportunity that

9
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,469
California has to really build a totally

10
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:39,808
unique different kind of cannabis

11
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,539
industry and even take that further into

12
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:43,768
agriculture at large and three I want to

13
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,249
talk a little bit about the capital

14
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:48,210
markets and especially China some of the

15
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:51,539
irregularities that that's causing in

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,698
our marketplace and in our industry so

17
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,308
to start off with flow Khanna simply

18
00:00:53,698 --> 00:01:00,838
speaking we are a branded supply chain

19
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:04,140
company ok we take a different approach

20
00:01:00,838 --> 00:01:06,329
than the traditional large scale big AG

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,219
model big farm model where instead of

22
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,840
growing our own cannabis we partner with

23
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,658
small farmers in the Emerald triangle

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,680
and only exclusively source sustainable

25
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:22,049
organic and kind of zero carbon emission

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,520
cannabis products at a high level we

27
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,259
have two components to our business we

28
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,359
have kind of the flow distribution arm

29
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,310
of things and the flow processing and

30
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,140
manufacturing side of things the flow

31
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,060
distribution very simple distribution

32
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,218
company we have three hubs across the

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,289
state in the Bay Area in LA and in San

34
00:01:35,218 --> 00:01:39,089
Diego and the flow processing and

35
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:41,460
manufacturing side we're headquartered

36
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,250
in the heart of the Emerald triangle in

37
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:46,769
Mendocino and we have three separate

38
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,718
aggregation hubs strategically located

39
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,269
in the Emerald triangle where we source

40
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:53,669
the product from the farmers we in take

41
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:55,798
it we grade it we sorted we trim it and

42
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,349
then that product gets sent down to our

43
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,380
main processing facility to get

44
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:03,868
value-add process manufactured at scale

45
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,239
the main processing facility we have was

46
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:08,520
used to be home of the old Fetzer winery

47
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,169
so we bought the old abandoned winery

48
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,790
from the Fetzer's that's about a two

49
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,500
hundred thousand square feet facility

50
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:16,199
it used to be home of the third largest

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,209
winery in the US and we are repurposing

52
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,310
it to do a centralized cannabis campus

53
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,629
that brings all the pieces of the supply

54
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,460
chain under one

55
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,979
so lab testing distribution

56
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,719
manufacturing packaging all the services

57
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,609
of small farmer needs to really given

58
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:34,500
the ability to scale and to compete with

59
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,730
a larger forces coming at bay we are

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,530
have the good fortune of being the

61
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:39,389
number one flour brand of the state

62
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,469
which is kind of a not only a testament

63
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:42,509
to kind of our hard work and our

64
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:44,520
commitment to this industry but rather a

65
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:46,500
testament to the conscious consumers of

66
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,540
California that are really voting with

67
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,669
their wallets for brands that are more

68
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:52,530
ecologically minded environmentally

69
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,479
minded and sustainably focus to really

70
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,780
build a different kind of industry which

71
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,579
we most definitely need to do and I kind

72
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,590
of always say we're at a very fragile

73
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,810
state in the cannabis industry a time

74
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,650
where the fate of this industry and the

75
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,120
livelihood of so many is really at stake

76
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,370
and California has the incredible

77
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,870
opportunity to really build something

78
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,400
radically different and radically

79
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,800
amazing something that I don't think

80
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,890
even agriculture as a large has really

81
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,200
seen see prohibition has been really

82
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:24,089
devastating to mankind it's cost the

83
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,579
nation billions of dollars it's

84
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,229
destroyed communities separated families

85
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,570
disproportionately affected minorities

86
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:32,459
just to name a few of the bad things but

87
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,159
in California prohibition did leave us

88
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,560
one gift and that gift was that it gave

89
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,229
us a totally fragmented supply chain of

90
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,240
more than 53,000 cannabis farmers and

91
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:45,090
these cannabis farmers not only live

92
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:49,250
totally off-grid lives with solar panels

93
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,810
rain catchment totally fully diversified

94
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,849
farms with carrots and cabbage and

95
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,610
tomatoes and celery and cucumbers

96
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,139
it's a beautiful and inspiring ecosystem

97
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,060
and not only is it beautiful and

98
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,549
inspiring but they're literally the

99
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,800
largest supply chain of the world these

100
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,270
53,000 cannabis farmers produce about

101
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,730
eighty-five percent of the cannabis

102
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,860
that's consumed nationwide we are

103
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:13,500
powering the black market of the nation

104
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,139
from this state and this is a very very

105
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,209
unique agricultural model that instead

106
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,099
of having the traditional the number one

107
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,988
and number two players at the top that

108
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,879
command ninety ninety five percent of

109
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:25,729
the market share that whole market share

110
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:30,569
of eighty five percent is split among

111
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:32,370
53,000 cannabis farmers and this

112
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:34,168
beautiful gift and this incredible model

113
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,590
of agriculture is at a great threat

114
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:37,500
right

115
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:39,869
and it's a threat to being lost by the

116
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,329
wayside of the traditional big AG model

117
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,310
the same big AG model that has decimated

118
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:46,409
our planet for decades and is a single

119
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,019
largest contributor to all of the

120
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,970
climate crisis we are exhibiting mono

121
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,310
cropping which is a common practice in

122
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,290
big AG to make it easy and simple and

123
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,329
more efficient has totally made us lose

124
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,740
a lot of the biological diversity we

125
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:01,079
have in the fruits and vegetables we

126
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,019
consume today so II for example wheat

127
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,490
and corn we enjoy maybe one or two

128
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:06,839
varietals in a universe of hundreds of

129
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,970
varieties that we've already lost as

130
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:12,060
mankind imagine if that happened to

131
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,580
cannabis and the loss of these worlds is

132
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,920
fertile soils in the biodiversity pose a

133
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:19,409
mortal threat to our future survival

134
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,259
we are literally killing ourselves with

135
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,870
our food production models that we have

136
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,519
on our planet today see modern

137
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,160
agriculture has turned our food

138
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,349
production into a business and in order

139
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,330
to win in business you have to scale you

140
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,120
have to lower your cost and you have to

141
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:37,800
make more margin right so fundamentally

142
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,139
it's caused our food production to drive

143
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,220
to use more chemicals and pesticides and

144
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:46,289
take cut corners and really you know pay

145
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,020
people lower wages and produce it

146
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,760
cheaper and cheaper and cheaper I don't

147
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,039
know why but I feel like that's a

148
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,360
fundamentally flawed model to really

149
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,310
produce the food and products that we

150
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,080
consume and now we have an opportunity

151
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,939
to do it in cannabis with our medicine

152
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,620
and why would we go in on the same route

153
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:04,319
to produce the cheapest possible

154
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,490
cannabis from our perspective we want to

155
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,870
produce the best possible cannabis and

156
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,970
this is the mission of flow kaanum

157
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,840
C we believe that the future of

158
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,280
Agriculture is small fragmented

159
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:20,129
decentralized farmers working with

160
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:24,000
centralization and technology to reach

161
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:26,689
scale and these are and these are models

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,579
that literally exist in our world today

163
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:30,149
for example the largest taxi cab company

164
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:32,669
in the world

165
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:34,349
uber doesn't own a single vehicle the

166
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,629
largest hotel chain in the world

167
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,939
Airbnb doesn't own a single room I

168
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:41,219
believe that the largest supply chain of

169
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,709
cannabis doesn't have to come from one

170
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,980
source and one producer and one big AG

171
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:48,359
farm so as we look to build this new

172
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,530
agricultural industry

173
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,669
why do we want to do more of the old

174
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:55,318
let's learn from the past and let's

175
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:57,209
build something different and imagine

176
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,830
something new after all that's part of

177
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:01,908
the pioneering and adventurous spirit

178
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:04,318
that all Californians like us hold dear

179
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:05,579
so it's up to us the operators the

180
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,740
distributors the retailers a

181
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,389
manufacturer the other cultivators to

182
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,038
really work in synchrony in harmony and

183
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,930
use your dollars and use your time and

184
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,430
use your resources to invest in the

185
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,560
brands that are pushing the industry

186
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,500
forward and are trying to build a better

187
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,598
industry for all of us to enjoy the

188
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,699
opportunity is grand and responsive and

189
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,519
the responsibility is even grander and

190
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,020
that responsibility is most evident when

191
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:30,209
you go take a visit to Canada our

192
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:31,680
neighbors up north and you understand a

193
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:33,839
little bit of the industry that they are

194
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,360
trying to build and I'll tell you it is

195
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,529
the polar opposite of the industry that

196
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,530
we have here in California

197
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:45,478
Canada contributes about zero

198
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,590
agricultural products to the world yet

199
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:48,778
they're building the biggest production

200
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:50,218
facilities for cannabis in the world so

201
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:52,139
all of them have to be these massive

202
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:53,430
indoor facilities because of the rules

203
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,528
and the regulations they've got to be

204
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:59,250
GMP certified they have to be ISO

205
00:07:55,528 --> 00:08:02,569
certified they literally have to use

206
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,829
full bodysuits to go in with a face mask

207
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:07,439
goggles a hairnet

208
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:09,149
gloves and booties I literally felt like

209
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,899
I was walking into a spaceship yet

210
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:14,338
instead I was walking into a farm you

211
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,500
know I couldn't help but think about my

212
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:18,209
home in Mendocino and the farmers that

213
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,098
we work with and really think about the

214
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:21,658
times where we are down in the ground

215
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:23,310
and playing with the little worms and

216
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:24,899
collecting the worm castings and getting

217
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,860
real dirt underneath your fingernails

218
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:31,079
real live dirt to create real live

219
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,060
high-quality products it's a very very

220
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,990
different industry it's an industry not

221
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:38,189
with farmers but with lab coats and

222
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,299
there's not a single agricultural

223
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,039
product in the world that's grown

224
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,259
indoors and I deeply feel that

225
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,429
California must lead the way in building

226
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:48,399
the cannabis industry that we deserve

227
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:51,699
[Applause]

228
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,039
I also learned that a lot of people out

229
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,190
there are trying to wrap a story around

230
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:59,500
empty jars and air literally and taking

231
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,810
it public these companies have no

232
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,909
long-term value and no sustain kind of

233
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:05,289
growth potential they're not really

234
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:07,000
thinking about the industry that we're

235
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:08,199
building not really thinking about the

236
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,610
value you can create or how many

237
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,110
communities you can empower and what

238
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,810
girl good you can do to the world

239
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,639
it's stim plea wrapping a story around a

240
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:17,169
public process and playing a little

241
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,259
fictitious game on a computer screen

242
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:21,759
around value and why are people rushing

243
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,559
to get an exit so quickly when we

244
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:27,039
haven't even begun the regulatory

245
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:28,269
process of this industry and I'm not

246
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,399
trying to dismiss the public process

247
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:32,559
after all capital is an incredibly

248
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,299
important component of raising any of

249
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,559
building any business and at falow

250
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:37,029
Connor we've raised probably as much

251
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:39,069
capital as any of the bigger players

252
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:41,500
here in California and we'll continue to

253
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,450
raise capital but not to build air but

254
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,529
to build a business of value to build a

255
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,090
difference that makes a difference to

256
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,579
the communities that we work with and to

257
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,379
really big bring more wholesome products

258
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,490
to the California cannabis industry at

259
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:56,500
large and see I grew up in Venezuela in

260
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,080
a third-world country and I learned

261
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,730
really early on that countries grow at

262
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,370
the pace that their capital markets

263
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,659
grown right you need capital to give it

264
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,190
to the entrepreneurs and the business

265
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:07,360
owners to create more value to create

266
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,640
more jobs to create more opportunities

267
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,860
and that's what helps economies develop

268
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,289
in like countries industries are the

269
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,820
same way we need those capital markets

270
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:18,039
we need those investors we need the

271
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,390
Canadian public process and we need it

272
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,719
to build the industry that we really

273
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:24,220
want to enjoy without them it would be

274
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,269
impossible for this industry to get off

275
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:31,480
its feet so in kind of closing remarks

276
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:33,819
and now opening up for questions I think

277
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,050
that as entrepreneurs in this room and a

278
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
lot of business owners that I see and a

279
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:38,500
lot of the cool brands that I see and a

280
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,600
lot of responsible operators that I see

281
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,009
let's remember that this gift that we

282
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,450
have to build our businesses it's

283
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:45,519
collectively building the industry

284
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,110
together and every single thing that we

285
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,399
do in every single day that we spend in

286
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,289
every resource and every dollar that we

287
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,000
put into this industry is building the

288
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:53,799
collective of the industry that over

289
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,840
time and over decades will soon

290
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:57,879
stabilize but it's in its very nascent

291
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,350
forms and that's the gift that we have

292
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,000
as entrepreneurs and business owners

293
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,639
right it's a gift to like take our

294
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,470
dreams

295
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,230
bring him and manifest them into reality

296
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,970
to shape and mold humanity to propel us

297
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,170
forward to build the dreams and the

298
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,028
things that we want to see in the world

299
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:13,129
so let's not forget that gift and let's

300
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:15,230
not forget that responsibility and we

301
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:17,539
must remember that in life what's truly

302
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,209
valuable is not what we get but it's

303
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:21,949
what we become it's not what we get out

304
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:24,169
of what we do that matters but it's who

305
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:27,470
we become in the process of getting what

306
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:30,019
we want that truly is valuable so what

307
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,839
industry are we trying to become what

308
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:36,019
companies are we trying to become and

309
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:38,959
what is California's place in the

310
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:41,269
grander market of the world and with

311
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,039
that said I just want to thank Susan one

312
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:44,750
more time because she's a very dear

313
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,028
friend of mine and I'm a very big fan of

314
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,990
this conference and I'm happy to open up

315
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:50,600
for questions because I think I have

316
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:54,680
more time to answer I think if that's

317
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,450
allowed Jaime Padilla I'm with United

318
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,939
Farm Workers it's the labor union of

319
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,730
Dolores Huerta and stace of Chavez I

320
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,980
found your message really encouraging

321
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:08,170
and what excites me most about cannabis

322
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:11,149
is the potential I see for the kind of

323
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:13,278
overflow of innovation and positive

324
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:17,110
change that can happen in agriculture

325
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:20,480
overall and and I particularly

326
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:23,539
interested in how you were talking about

327
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,269
tapping into that positive consumer

328
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:29,360
power to drive some of this change and

329
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:32,448
as you as you all think through that I'm

330
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,669
curious as to you know when you when you

331
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:37,849
talk about social responsibility and

332
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:40,819
sustainability the the labor piece of

333
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:44,120
that right and I did a lot of work in

334
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:46,278
the coffee industry where that there

335
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,448
there was so much focus on small farmers

336
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:53,059
folks forgot about the labor that went

337
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:57,078
into into coffee and I'm concerned about

338
00:12:53,059 --> 00:13:00,939
that happening here and I'm curious how

339
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:04,099
you're factoring labor into into your

340
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,829
work on social responsibility so it's

341
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,329
two parts so once you first asked about

342
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:10,009
you know what are we doing to kind of

343
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:11,448
encourage positive consumers to kind of

344
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:13,429
engage in these types of products in

345
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:15,088
this type of Industry and to talk about

346
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:16,438
the forces of the labor

347
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:20,459
how important that is to building an

348
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:22,049
industry more or less okay so I'll start

349
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,088
off with a second actually we are one of

350
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:25,620
the largest employers in Mendocino so

351
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:27,629
we've been working with the county of

352
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,429
Mendocino and the CEO of the county very

353
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:31,079
regularly we've actually been talking to

354
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:32,909
a couple of the labor unions as well so

355
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:35,549
I'd be curious to get your card as we

356
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:36,778
kind of build this industry and I think

357
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,549
you're absolutely right I mean I think

358
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:41,249
agriculture as large as suffered from

359
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:42,838
kind of improper treatment to small

360
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:45,149
farmers and they're marginalized the

361
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,990
workers I came from Venezuela and I used

362
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:47,490
to work with actually coffee

363
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,709
cooperatives I'm not sure exactly where

364
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,240
your coffee cooperatives work but it's

365
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,919
much in the same way and I think right

366
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,959
now in cannabis it's it's a different

367
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,610
consciousness that these farmers have in

368
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,768
a different culture that people live in

369
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,839
Mendocino and it's very much about that

370
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:02,818
community right I think them at large

371
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,170
it's not never been maybe because the

372
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:05,429
profits have been so large has never

373
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:06,808
been about the bottom line it's really

374
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,698
been about how do they share this

375
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:09,958
product with their farmers with their

376
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:12,179
neighbors with the people that work at

377
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,558
their farm and I think that ethos we

378
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:15,269
have to preserve it and trying to keep

379
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:17,789
it forward as we keep on growing this

380
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:21,149
industry and secondly addressing to the

381
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:22,919
consumers and the cannabis market it's a

382
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:24,839
tough task right I think we live in a

383
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,028
very very noisy world right we live in

384
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,319
the attention economy right every brand

385
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:30,120
is struggling to get the consumers

386
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:31,469
attention and I really believe that the

387
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,490
best marketing is a marketing that comes

388
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,259
from the heart that comes from talking

389
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,818
about values and that's really what we

390
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:37,409
focused on at Flo Cara

391
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:39,058
yes we're like sustainable and we'll

392
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:41,938
organic and we have all we tick all

393
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:43,379
those boxes of like the fact driven kind

394
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:45,028
of behavior patterns but at the end of

395
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:46,740
the day consumers choose product because

396
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:48,208
of an emotional connection right they'll

397
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,278
pick up a brand or they'll read an

398
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,808
article or they see a clipping and

399
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:53,669
they'll connect either emotionally with

400
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:55,289
it or whether or not to that brand and I

401
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:56,669
think that's kind of how we focused on

402
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:58,379
building kind of our customer base is

403
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:59,549
always being true to what we believe and

404
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:01,379
kind of wearing our values kind of on

405
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:02,519
our sleeves you helped me understand

406
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:04,829
when you're dealing with that many

407
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,649
supply outputs how you maintain quality

408
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:09,899
control so I would say that in our kind

409
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:11,490
of our model you know we don't have a

410
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,749
large scale farm so we don't have all

411
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,480
the work and all the investments

412
00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:17,009
required to get that off the ground but

413
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,558
on the flip side we work with so many

414
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:21,300
fragmented and separated farmers so what

415
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:23,370
we do have is a big farmer relations

416
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:24,659
team so the farmer relations team is

417
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,419
working with the farmers to work on

418
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:28,809
strain planning strain mapping so a lot

419
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:30,909
of the a lot of what we're seeing right

420
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:32,679
now is that you know I think that

421
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:35,350
industries naturally move towards you

422
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:37,359
know consistency and standardization and

423
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,800
Brandt and consumers at large look for

424
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,230
that in a brand that had the repeatable

425
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,240
experience so for us we have to work

426
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,860
very very closely with our farmers I

427
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,210
mean we have monthly meetings with them

428
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,800
we have quarterly retreats with them

429
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,600
we're always constantly reviewing what

430
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:51,519
they're producing what quality came out

431
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,950
of it we've developed a kind of a

432
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,139
grading system internally at flow Cana

433
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,540
between triple a flour double a flour

434
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:00,159
single a and single B which is the same

435
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:01,480
grading system that happens in any other

436
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,429
form of Agriculture whether you go into

437
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,409
the citrus industry or the coffee or the

438
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,479
cacao industry there's a universal

439
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:09,219
grading system so we've built that over

440
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,750
the last few years at flow Cana and then

441
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,700
we kind of open sourced it to a lot of

442
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,870
the coops in the region so they've been

443
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,310
able to give their input they've been

444
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,528
able to give their comments and then

445
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,819
we've then given that to kind of ice CFA

446
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:21,039
which is the International cannabis

447
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,000
farmers Association and they've been you

448
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,709
know they said this then have been

449
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,450
improved the grading system and have

450
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,740
taken a kind of unlife of itself got

451
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,270
input from the market from the

452
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,620
dispensary so we're really trying to

453
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:31,179
establish kind of standards in the

454
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,379
industry that we can all work with and

455
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:34,359
these are the same standards that happen

456
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:35,769
across all other industries so I would

457
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,169
say that kind of dealing with the supply

458
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:39,909
is about you know having a baseline

459
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:41,588
understanding of how we talk about the

460
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:43,449
product the grading and the sorting is a

461
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,800
key component and I would say the second

462
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,000
is just farmer relations and just being

463
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,889
really constantly involved with the

464
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,629
community and being very strategic that

465
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:51,189
the challenge with cannabis is you know

466
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:52,779
you're already picking the strains today

467
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,730
that you're planting in March they're

468
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:56,350
going to be harvested in SX Tober so you

469
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,670
have to have so much planning and really

470
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,889
have to predict what the market is gonna

471
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:01,750
want in the future so it's a it's a

472
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:03,809
tough task but it's one that we take on

473
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,799
every day really yeah

474
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:06,909
all right guys we'll enjoy the rest of

475
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:09,559
the conference

476
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:22,528
