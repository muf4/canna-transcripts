1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,429
a presentation that is gonna be kind of

2
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:24,000
like the road to Prohibition and then

3
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:26,309
the path to legalization so I'll tell

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,750
you a little bit about myself because we

5
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:29,759
want this to you kind of like an open

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,250
discussion so I'm gonna disclose a few

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,489
things about myself I went to Stanford

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,230
Law School after college and you would

9
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:39,628
think that Stanford Law School would be

10
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:42,209
a pretty conservative law school

11
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:45,869
experience for most law students it was

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:49,469
but for me it was very different there

13
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:51,448
were these housing cooperatives at

14
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:55,859
Stanford and one of them was named the

15
00:00:51,448 --> 00:01:00,000
enchanted broccoli forest where my chief

16
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:02,939
dealer lived and so I was exposed to the

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,670
psychedelic undergraduate and graduate

18
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:08,849
culture at Stanford going there for law

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,670
school there was a literary society

20
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:14,399
called Alpha Delta Phi the Alpha delt

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,228
and they had an initiation which

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,439
consisted of going to the hills of

23
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:22,289
Stanford where the dish this is like a

24
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,709
radar dish was located on a full moon

25
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:30,090
and taking LSD and having an initiation

26
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:32,419
ceremony and when I was at Stanford the

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,719
DEA was on to Stanford students

28
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,359
synthesizing LSD so they would carefully

29
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,039
control all the precursors no precursors

30
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,019
to get the Stanford all strictly

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,640
controlled so Stanford students would

32
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,250
not be deterred by this they just

33
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,390
invented new ways to synthesize

34
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,170
precursors and once they had their

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:55,159
precursor they would synthesize LSD and

36
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,930
when I was in law school you know in the

37
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,570
spirit of like openness and disclosing

38
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,149
my own psychedelic experiences I had the

39
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:07,228
good fortune of having access to some of

40
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:11,400
the purest LSD at the time on earth and

41
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:12,979
it was all manufactured right on campus

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,408
by Stanford students

43
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:17,639
many who avidly experimented with pure

44
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:20,609
LSD

45
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,938
I also took other psychedelics mushrooms

46
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,909
ecstasy it was legal back then it hadn't

47
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:28,650
yet been scheduled and I can tell you

48
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:31,649
that is an intentional use of

49
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,590
psychedelics really enriched my life and

50
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,310
was positive for me I can also tell you

51
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,920
that I experimented with william blake's

52
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,289
this maxim the path of excess leads to

53
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:46,738
the palace of wisdom and I also learned

54
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:49,798
you know through overindulgence that the

55
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,959
perils of straying too far with

56
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:53,400
psychedelics so now we're going to talk

57
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,650
about the etymology of the term

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,450
psychedelic I'm glad Peter asked me to

59
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,760
do this presentation because I really

60
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:01,518
didn't know where the word came from

61
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:03,328
it's a word that was coined by dr.

62
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,239
Humphrey Osmond

63
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:09,450
he was a British born psychiatrist who

64
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,700
emigrated to Canada and he was a

65
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:13,619
pioneering psychiatrist who did some of

66
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:16,159
the very first research with mescaline

67
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,530
and LSD

68
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,930
he also took peyote with members of the

69
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,659
Native American church and said it was

70
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,939
not madness but a mystical experience so

71
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:29,310
this is somebody who's not well-known to

72
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,469
many people in psychedelic world at

73
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,658
least not to me and it's somebody who is

74
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:36,449
very interesting and serves as an

75
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:38,098
inspiration for you know future

76
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:41,340
endeavors if you're like a psychiatrist

77
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:43,439
we're gonna hear from a psychiatrist who

78
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,530
is what I would consider maybe a

79
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:50,579
modern-day Humphry Osmond dr. Cole

80
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,199
Martin today so psychedelics how are

81
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,900
they defined you know according to the

82
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,299
Oxford English Dictionary it's basically

83
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,819
a drug which produces an alteration of

84
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,299
the mind and apparent expansion of

85
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:05,369
consciousness often accompanied by

86
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:07,019
hallucinations and you know remember

87
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,799
that reality as a consensual

88
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:13,889
hallucination in 1953 dr. Humphrey

89
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,129
Osment was in correspondence with Aldous

90
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:20,639
Huxley and Humphry Osmond came out to

91
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:24,089
the LA region for a conference at which

92
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,490
point he administered 400 milligrams of

93
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:29,879
mescaline to Aldous hooks

94
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:32,519
how does Huxley had his mind blown wide

95
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:35,879
open by this experience and he wrote

96
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,469
about the the whole mind opening

97
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,379
experience in the doors of perception

98
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,680
which was a seminal work extremely

99
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:46,379
influential he described staring at a

100
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,019
bunch of flowers and said I was seeing

101
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:52,469
what Adam had seen on the morning of his

102
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:56,310
creation the miracle moment by moment of

103
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:59,520
naked existence and I think you know if

104
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,500
you have read Naked Lunch

105
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,019
I think Naked Lunch is also describing

106
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:09,240
that you know looking at that in the

107
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:10,769
moment so um William Blake also wrote

108
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,470
about the doors of perception and this

109
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:17,099
influenced the title of the Huxley book

110
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,200
and William Blake who was tremendously

111
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,390
influential you know the doors here in

112
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,389
Venice the doors were influenced by

113
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:26,819
William Blake that was the name of the

114
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:28,439
band the doors if the doors of

115
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:33,449
perception were cleansed everything

116
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:36,180
would appear to humans as it is infinite

117
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:38,550
for humans that closed themselves up

118
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,600
till they see all things through narrow

119
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,009
chinks of their cavern and so

120
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,080
psychedelics were a way to expand

121
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:51,180
awareness Huxley suggested a new word

122
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,918
for narrow thym to describe substances

123
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,800
like masculine which expanded awareness

124
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:59,339
and this is made from the Greek terms

125
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,280
that indicate reveal and spirit he wrote

126
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:05,489
a little poem to say to make this

127
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:12,629
trivial world sublime take half a gram

128
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:15,300
of venero theim and Osman countered with

129
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:18,629
a better one in my opinion to fathom

130
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,660
hell or soar angelic just take a pinch

131
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:24,209
of psychedelic and that comes from

132
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:28,590
psyche for mind and Della's for manifest

133
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:30,509
and it's basically mind manifesting so

134
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:32,429
now the path to psychedelic prohibition

135
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:37,349
is kind of interesting and it involves

136
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:39,150
Timothy Leary in 1969 the US Supreme

137
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,189
Court issued a landmark

138
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:44,279
opinion in Larry versus the United

139
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:46,469
States Timothy Leary was being

140
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,189
prosecuted for violating the fair the

141
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:53,610
federal marijuana Tax Act which required

142
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:55,769
him to file for a tax stamp he didn't

143
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,170
file for a tax stamp and he said I can't

144
00:06:55,769 --> 00:07:00,719
because it's illegal under Texas law I

145
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,939
would be incriminating myself and I this

146
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,590
would violate the Fifth Amendment the US

147
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,550
Supreme Court and this was the warrant

148
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:10,500
court agreed with them unanimously

149
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:13,920
giving that it was illegal in Texas to

150
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,750
possess marijuana then Timothy Leary

151
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,280
would be incriminating himself if he

152
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,139
complied with the registration

153
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,649
requirements of the marihuana Tax Act

154
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:24,899
and the US Supreme Court invalidated the

155
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:27,719
marihuana Tax Act vacated the

156
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:30,239
convictions around the same time it was

157
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,480
you know the summer love was you know

158
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,730
1968 just right before then there was

159
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,250
like a conservative backlash and so

160
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,810
Congress replaced the marihuana Tax Act

161
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,689
which was no longer enforceable because

162
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:45,120
it violated the Fifth Amendment with the

163
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:47,399
comprehensive drug abuse prevention and

164
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,090
Control Act which was signed into law by

165
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:52,739
President Richard Nixon title two of

166
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:56,849
this Act was the Controlled Substances

167
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,650
Act so this is the birth of psychedelic

168
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,200
prohibition the Controlled Substances

169
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:03,389
Act of 1970 for the most part you know

170
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,099
that they isolated psychedelics had been

171
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,949
prohibited before that but this was kind

172
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:12,390
of like a widespread unitary statutory

173
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:15,659
prohibition and it classified substances

174
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:19,110
into one of five schedules Schedule one

175
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:22,530
has a high potential for abuse no

176
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,480
accepted medical use and a high

177
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:27,299
potential for addiction such that the

178
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:31,200
drug is not safe for to use even under

179
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:34,169
medical supervision schedule two high

180
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,120
potential for abuse yes sometimes

181
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,509
accepted medical use with severe

182
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,690
restrictions and abuse can cause severe

183
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:43,289
addiction schedule 3 medium potential

184
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,200
for abuse

185
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:49,049
yes accepted medical use it can cause

186
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,320
severe mental addiction scheduled for

187
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:53,120
low potential for abuse yes accepted

188
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,250
medical you

189
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:00,090
schedule five the lowest potential for

190
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:04,049
abuse and it may lead to a mild mental

191
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:06,780
or physical addiction so schedule 1

192
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:09,959
controlled substances you know one of

193
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:13,289
them which I don't think is physically

194
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,870
addictive cannabis you know was placed

195
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:20,879
into Schedule one it's a mild

196
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:22,440
psychedelic so was DMT so was I Bo gain

197
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,899
they're just like adding everything they

198
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:30,540
could think of into its Schedule one so

199
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:32,639
was LSD so it's MDMA and mescaline which

200
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:36,149
is the psychoactive constituent of

201
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:39,240
peyote and San Pedro cactus as well as

202
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:44,629
peyote itself which is sacred to maybe

203
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:47,039
many Native American tribes as well as

204
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:50,399
psilocybin and psilocin which are the

205
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:52,559
psychoactive components of psilocybin

206
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,269
mushrooms and here we have a picture of

207
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,029
cubensis but there are literally dozens

208
00:09:54,269 --> 00:10:01,620
of mushrooms that are it's like

209
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:03,059
psychological psychoactive then this is

210
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,460
the Controlled Substances Act you know

211
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:07,649
the schedule one they basically try to

212
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,060
add every single hallucinogenic

213
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,059
substance they could think of to

214
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:13,349
schedule one with really no supporting

215
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:15,209
research because a lot of these

216
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,220
substances they don't have a high

217
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,740
potential for abuse for the simple

218
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,990
reason that it bad trips happen and

219
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,480
after a bad trip people don't want to go

220
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,970
back there something about the

221
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,230
Controlled Substances Act is Howcast

222
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:35,490
casks and arbitrary it is so for example

223
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:37,710
cocaine cocaine base which is crack PCP

224
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,450
and fentanyl are scheduled to meaning

225
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,850
even though they have a high potential

226
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,920
for abuse yes there's an accepted

227
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,320
medical use with severe restrictions

228
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:50,129
although the abusing the drug can cause

229
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,890
severe physical and mental addiction now

230
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:54,750
marijuana is Schedule one with no

231
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:57,029
accepted medical use makes no sense at

232
00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,389
all that's an old Saab we'll move on to

233
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:02,759
you know you know marijuana is never a

234
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:05,039
hundred percent THC marijuana is like

235
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,509
some percentage of THC and then some CBD

236
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,610
and

237
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,950
you know a lot of terpenes and a lot of

238
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,810
other cannabinoids

239
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:14,540
well sure Navin all which is a hundred

240
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:16,489
percent THC that's just a Schedule three

241
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:21,620
controlled substance that's known as

242
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:23,509
marinol and then dronabinol in oral

243
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,820
liquid form that you can drink and get

244
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:27,529
super duper high that's a schedule two

245
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,930
controlled substance even though that's

246
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:33,470
a hundred percent THC so this just shows

247
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:39,319
how kefka ask this whole classification

248
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:40,519
of the schedules of our now we're gonna

249
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,200
move on to kind of like the federal

250
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,990
mandatory minimums you know it's part of

251
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,820
like this ridiculous prohibition that

252
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,710
we're living under this is the current

253
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,800
state of the law right now and so

254
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:56,060
there's a US Supreme Court case that

255
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:59,599
discussed the mandatory minimums for LSD

256
00:11:56,059 --> 00:12:01,519
and you know very briefly you know this

257
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,110
is the Chapman versus United States case

258
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,269
and I want to say the name of the guy

259
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,180
who you know it's was sentenced to a

260
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:10,610
mandatory minimum Richard Chapman and he

261
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:12,019
was selling a Bible ten sheets of a

262
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:16,580
thousand doses of blotter paper

263
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:18,829
containing LSD and according to the US

264
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:24,050
Supreme Court the weight of the LSD

265
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:26,540
alone was 50 milligrams or 0.050 grams

266
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:30,740
and the weight of the LSD with the

267
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:33,019
blotter was 5.7 grams the US Supreme

268
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,360
Court held that the statute requires the

269
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:36,740
weight of the carrier medium to be

270
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,750
included when determining the

271
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,629
appropriate sentence for trafficking in

272
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,600
LSD and this construction is neither a

273
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:45,740
violation of due process nor

274
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,500
unconstitutionally vague and that

275
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,470
basically meant that based on the weight

276
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,480
of the blotter paper somebody was giving

277
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,580
a mandatory minimum sentence and if

278
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:00,019
you're curious what the mandatory

279
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:01,700
minimums are for LSD and it's the only

280
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:04,759
psychedelic that is subject to the

281
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:09,230
mandatory minimums it's right here so a

282
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:11,720
mixture counting blotter paper of one to

283
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,450
nine grams is a five-year mandatory

284
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,759
minimum for the first offense and a

285
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,470
10-year mandatory minimum for the second

286
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,750
offense

287
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,000
and curiously in the Chapman case the US

288
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:26,389
Supreme Court said this is just because

289
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,330
the LSD is impregnated into the blotter

290
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:33,710
paper and cannot be separated if it was

291
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:35,870
in a bottle liquid LSD then you would

292
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,420
not count the weight of the bottle so

293
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,269
that that's a practical tip from the US

294
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:43,279
Supreme Court don't put it in blotter

295
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:44,629
keep it in a bottle liquid LSD so they

296
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,929
don't use the weight of the carrier

297
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:50,179
medium against you if the amount is 10

298
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:52,339
grams or more first time

299
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:55,549
clean record 10 year mandatory minimum

300
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:58,850
second offense 20-year mandatory minimum

301
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:59,809
and two or more priors basically

302
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,600
three-strikes-you're-out

303
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:08,269
life imprisonment and we still have

304
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,940
prisoners in federal court serving time

305
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:13,370
for LSD even though like people are

306
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,800
engaging in schedule one distribution of

307
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,350
marijuana and and overlooking the

308
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:23,000
classification of marijuana a Schedule

309
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:26,990
one you know it's with when it comes to

310
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,299
enforcement of LSD I think it's still

311
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,620
happening we've seen reduced enforcement

312
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:33,409
I can tell you the good news is I

313
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,980
haven't really seen an LSD cases case in

314
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:36,079
years

315
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,970
there's doesn't seem to be much interest

316
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,190
in there now we're gonna discuss

317
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,200
cannabis legalization in California and

318
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:45,560
what lessons can be learned from

319
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,200
California for thinking about how to

320
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:51,319
legalize psychedelics in the future so

321
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,180
in California I was the first state of

322
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,290
the nation that really kicked off this

323
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:59,929
worldwide cannabis legalization movement

324
00:14:56,289 --> 00:15:01,699
with proposition 215 which legalized

325
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:04,359
medical use and cultivation with a

326
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:09,680
physician's recommendation or approval

327
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:11,690
in 2004 the Legislature passed Senate

328
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,569
bill 420 which established the

329
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,250
collective and cooperative defense and

330
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:19,010
at that point the caregiver defense

331
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,019
became increasingly rare because it was

332
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:22,429
far more difficult to establish that one

333
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,539
was a caregiver and then just to show

334
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:29,539
that one was a member of a collective in

335
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:31,459
2010 in response to proposition 19 which

336
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:33,849
would have legalized marijuana

337
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:38,629
the legislature at the behest of

338
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:41,629
Governor Schwarzenegger we reduce the

339
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:45,649
penalties for marijuana from you know a

340
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:47,029
misdemeanor to an infraction and it

341
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:49,490
didn't really reduce the penalty the

342
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:51,679
penalty was already $100 fine no jail

343
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,049
time what it did is it took away the

344
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:57,019
right to a jury trial and my very first

345
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:59,120
case was marijuana jury trial

346
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:00,230
you know possession Alessa and announced

347
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,470
in van nuys

348
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:06,350
it took a whole week you know it was a

349
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:10,580
hung jury the prosecutor was furious so

350
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:14,509
we didn't plead guilty and you know that

351
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:18,139
I could tell you like it's it was better

352
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:20,149
having possession be a misdemeanor than

353
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:24,080
an infraction just because you got a

354
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:25,759
jury trial in 2015 the legislature just

355
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,680
really got sick of collectives and

356
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,330
cooperatives it basically said this is a

357
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,759
Wild West it's out of control it makes

358
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:34,160
no sense and they wanted to tame the

359
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,899
wild tiger of medical cannabis so they

360
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,269
passed the medical marijuana regulation

361
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:39,829
Safety Act which established a

362
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:43,850
regulatory framework for medical

363
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:46,430
cannabis and also set up a sunset clause

364
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:51,740
for collectives basically an expiration

365
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:53,659
date 2016 we have prop 64 which was an

366
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:58,519
adult youth regulatory framework with

367
00:16:53,659 --> 00:17:01,490
partial decriminalization so before prop

368
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:04,940
64 cultivation of a single plant was a

369
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:07,130
felony and with a medical defense but

370
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,920
still a felony often prosecuted in court

371
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,350
with the medical defense and often ended

372
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:15,350
up resolving as a misdemeanor after prop

373
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:17,269
60 for most cultivation became a

374
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:19,099
misdemeanor there's you know a million

375
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:23,329
plants now it's a misdemeanor if the

376
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:26,088
person is over 21 and so law enforcement

377
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:28,960
lost their enthusiasm for prosecuting

378
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:32,240
cannabis cases while it's still illegal

379
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,660
and now there's like a regulatory

380
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,009
framework so in 2017 the legislature

381
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,410
said we don't want to have a separate

382
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:40,879
framework for medical and a separate set

383
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,000
of regulations for adult we're gonna

384
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,640
unify both frameworks and

385
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,539
this resulted in the medicinal and adult

386
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,720
used cannabis regulation and Safety Act

387
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:56,470
2018 we had the state issuing licenses

388
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,880
for commercial cannabis activity

389
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,440
regulatory rulemaking began and now we

390
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,190
have a new set of regulations and

391
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,140
remember in January 9 2019 the

392
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,330
collective and cooperative defense will

393
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,070
expire and we can anticipate there's

394
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:12,500
going to be an increase in enforcement

395
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:14,960
but the way cannabis was legalized in

396
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,789
California it was not legalized there

397
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,539
was a partial reduction in the penalties

398
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:24,019
and then this onerous highly regulated

399
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:26,269
system that is akin to the way that

400
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:29,779
plutonium is regulated it's over

401
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:31,190
regulated and why am i bringing this up

402
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:33,829
these are lessons that need to be

403
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,440
learned when we think about legalizing

404
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:40,939
psychedelics maybe not repeat not use

405
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,320
the same model for cannabis so now we're

406
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,960
gonna discuss the California initiative

407
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,139
process because the way that cannabis

408
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,720
legalization was kicked off worldwide

409
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,759
was not by changing the federal law the

410
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,069
federal representatives are not

411
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:57,829
responsive to the will of the people it

412
00:18:55,069 --> 00:19:01,909
was through voter initiatives the first

413
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:05,449
one was prop 215 in 1996 and the second

414
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:08,120
one was prop 64 in 2016 because the

415
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,250
legislature wouldn't do it they did not

416
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:11,569
have the political will and I feel it's

417
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,210
the same thing when it comes to

418
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:17,689
psychedelics and other controlled

419
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,640
substances there is not the will for

420
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,680
politicians who are constantly thinking

421
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,630
about re-election and maybe this is

422
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,990
something where the citizens need to

423
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:29,000
take the initiative so the initiative

424
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,430
process in California to get an

425
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,960
initiative on the ballot you need 5% of

426
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:37,940
the people who voted for governor and at

427
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,509
the very last election which was

428
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,100
November 6 we had 7 million two hundred

429
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:45,379
and thirteen thousand four hundred

430
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:47,689
sixty-four people so you really need

431
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,830
three hundred and sixty thousand you

432
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:56,390
know plus or minus signatures to get on

433
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:58,250
the ballot how do you draft the language

434
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:00,740
of the initiative well the California

435
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,559
government code has something very handy

436
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,390
it requires the Legislative Council to

437
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:08,869
cooperate with proponents of an

438
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:11,030
initiative in preparing then they should

439
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:14,569
have when requested in writing to do so

440
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:17,029
by 25 or more electors electors just

441
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:20,240
means registered voters proposing the

442
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:22,250
measure and so basically 25 people would

443
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,920
get together they would draft the

444
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,569
language for the initiative and then you

445
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,039
can go to the Legislative Council and

446
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:30,439
they will help you come up with the

447
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:32,779
language to effectuate the aims of the

448
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,670
initiative I found this incredibly

449
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:39,500
helpful when I was writing marijuana

450
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:42,470
legalization initiatives in 2016 2010

451
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,210
2012 but you know I heard many none of

452
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,500
which got on the ballot but had they

453
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,039
gotten on the ballot we would have seen

454
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:53,660
like more radical legalization than what

455
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:56,599
we have now and then this is to prevent

456
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:59,029
people from coming in with what if the

457
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,889
UFOs land initiative and would you

458
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:03,170
please write an initiative for you know

459
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,550
the government when the UFOs land it has

460
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,900
to be something where the Legislative

461
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:07,789
Council thinks there's reasonable

462
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,290
probability that the measure will be

463
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:11,450
submitted to the voters of the state

464
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:13,099
under the laws relating to the

465
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,930
submission of initiatives so basically

466
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:17,959
you got to have a decent shot at getting

467
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:19,120
those signatures for them to help you

468
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,769
they're not gonna be just writing

469
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,779
hypothetical initiatives or you know

470
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:26,569
like the unconstitutional initiative the

471
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:28,069
guy who wanted to shoot gay people there

472
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:31,460
the Legislative Council will not get

473
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:33,649
involved in their drafting the language

474
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,840
language of the initiative you know I'm

475
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:38,750
working with the Legislative Council as

476
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:43,459
I have there is a person who would be in

477
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:45,410
charge of you know I guess look helping

478
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,829
people if there was an initiative and

479
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:52,910
that's Jacob Henninger and he has

480
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:54,289
advised many initiative drafters and he

481
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,090
is somebody who I can tell you is

482
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:59,119
receptive to the idea of criminal

483
00:21:56,089 --> 00:22:00,409
justice reform and he would be happy and

484
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:05,119
honored to start working on a

485
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:07,600
psychedelic reform initiative and so an

486
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:10,389
idea that I'm proposing is the idea of

487
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:13,089
California cognitive Liberty initiative

488
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:16,750
and this is based on a term that was

489
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:19,089
coined by Richard Glenn Barr and his

490
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,490
partner neural ethicist dr. rice

491
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:23,529
intention and their founders of the

492
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,900
nonprofit Center for cognitive liberty

493
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:28,119
and ethics and so taking about with a

494
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,040
really cool idea which I'd like to share

495
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:32,289
it's the idea of cognitive Liberty which

496
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:35,619
is the right of each individual to think

497
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:38,379
independently and autonomously to use

498
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:40,269
the full power of his or her mind and to

499
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:44,110
engage in multiple modes of thought and

500
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:45,789
this means the right to use controlled

501
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:48,879
substances to explore human

502
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:51,430
consciousness this also means the right

503
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,890
to be autonomous and not have you know

504
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:59,410
the artificial drugging of people for

505
00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:02,110
psychiatric reasons as and you know so I

506
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:04,150
think this is like an initiative though

507
00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:07,149
it's an idea that whose time has come

508
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:08,620
and I asked dr. or I asked Richard clamp

509
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,870
are well you come in here and will you

510
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:12,519
talk about this and he's like no I kind

511
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:14,500
of moved on to other things you know but

512
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:16,869
you can go ahead and talk about it and

513
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,539
so I would like you to look kind of like

514
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:21,369
if you can get a chance please spread on

515
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:23,409
the you know this idea of cognitive

516
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:25,059
liberty and just start researching it

517
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:27,430
it's a great idea it's kind of

518
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:29,409
libertarian you know the idea is that

519
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,900
nobody should tell you what to think and

520
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:34,240
that these psychedelic substances give

521
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,980
you the ability to have completely

522
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,380
different thoughts that you could not

523
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,370
have otherwise and it's your right as a

524
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:44,080
human being who wants to engage in your

525
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:46,719
exploration of your own consciousness to

526
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,759
be allowed to use these substances in

527
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,500
the privacy of your own space as long as

528
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:54,849
you hurt nobody it's I think it's it's a

529
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:58,329
very appealing idea and I want to spread

530
00:23:54,849 --> 00:24:00,399
that idea and this brings us back to dr.

531
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:03,159
Humphry Osmond who thought that

532
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,200
psychedelics could help humanity you

533
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,870
know he said I believe that psychedelics

534
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,049
provide a chance perhaps only a slender

535
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:13,869
one for homo Faber that's like the human

536
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:17,048
who builds the cunning ruthless

537
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:19,748
foolhardy pleasure greedy tool maker

538
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:23,079
to merge into that other creature whose

539
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:26,259
presence we so rashly presumed Homo

540
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:29,048
sapiens the wise the understanding the

541
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:32,110
compassionate in whose fourfold vision

542
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:36,839
art politics science and religion are

543
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:36,839
one so that's

544
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:55,940
