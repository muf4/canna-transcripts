1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:08,759
[Music]

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,000
I've always been a scientist and an

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,439
entrepreneur kind of both that had a

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,280
little bit of the lemonade stand uh but

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,118
in college actually started an internet

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,559
service provider and was always

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,759
interested in being on The Cutting Edge

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,118
of technology and and making change that

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,880
would be positive for society went on to

10
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,759
graduate school out here in Los Angeles

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,719
California because it was a big place

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,599
for opportunity the uh adviser that was

13
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:33,119
doing research at USC was doing some

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,840
really interesting things in an

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,878
environmentally and friendly fashion

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,640
making non-natural amino acids and other

17
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:40,878
types of building blocks that could be

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,079
useful in the pharmaceutical industry I

19
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,799
was trained to think about

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,759
environmentally friendly methods of

21
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,718
production trained to think of you know

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,679
how you can do things to better improve

23
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,960
Society um making molecules do kind of

24
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,479
more of what you would like turn them

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,878
into materials turn them into uh food

26
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,718
ingredients turn them into

27
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:59,280
Pharmaceuticals or fine chemical

28
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,280
building blocks for things that we use

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,239
as fuels and and other stuff like that

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,920
so I'd always thought you know chemistry

31
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,399
could use those types of skill sets and

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,200
understandings to be an entrepreneur and

33
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,118
make a big positive impact um and I

34
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,719
thought yeah that was a great place to

35
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:17,519
to start i' always had an interest in

36
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,679
working towards helping people medically

37
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,640
so I had always had that type of mindset

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,520
to go out there and be uh involved in

39
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,478
research and help make medicines and try

40
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,359
and change people for the better what

41
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:28,959
can we understand what can we learn and

42
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,159
how can we produce things at low cost

43
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,839
for people graduate school taught me

44
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,359
environmentally friendly methods how to

45
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,478
think about your economic and

46
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:38,319
environmental impacts of the processes

47
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,359
that you perform to produce these things

48
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,959
at scale how do you scale them up in a

49
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,438
safe fashioned way that we won't hurt

50
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,519
the people that are performing those

51
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,078
processes how do you not leave residues

52
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,879
in the products and how do you become

53
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:51,078
really good at making things in a an

54
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,399
efficient and effective manner for both

55
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:56,718
yourself and the environment um I was

56
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,159
working as a as an entrepreneur I was

57
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,839
working in a lot of different areas find

58
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,960
chemical manuf facturing ways of

59
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,680
producing chemicals and different means

60
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,599
when my brother came to me and said he

61
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,280
was at a construction company and he was

62
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,079
asked to build out a storefront

63
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,318
dispensary um and that was around the

64
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,400
end of 2008 so building a dispensary I

65
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,039
said dispensary for what I have no idea

66
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,200
what you're talking about and he told me

67
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,759
it was for medicinal cannabis my first

68
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,199
impression was is that legal I can't

69
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,639
believe that that would be legal in any

70
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,719
way shape or form but turns out I moved

71
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:30,479
out here in 1997 and in 1996 is when the

72
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,680
voters passed the initia

73
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,799
was not very politically interested or

74
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,959
activated in any way shape or form I was

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,640
focused on school science and getting my

76
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,199
degree and doing my thing um but this

77
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,238
kind of woke me up to say wow there's

78
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,799
you know voter initiatives there's laws

79
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,480
that can be put in place by the people

80
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,200
and they think things should be done in

81
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,359
certain Fashions um and sure enough prop

82
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:55,039
215 existed sb420 was already enacted at

83
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,440
that point since the end of 208 in the

84
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,280
beginning of 2009 when President Obama

85
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,680
said you know patience I'm not going to

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,239
come after you you guys I'm really

87
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,319
worried about drug dealers and cartels I

88
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,519
thought well maybe there's an

89
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,399
opportunity um I certainly was going

90
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,840
through my own physical ailments as well

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,719
I had had bouts with an irritable bowel

92
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,439
they had given me lots of antibiotics to

93
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,000
the point where my face swelled up and I

94
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:18,799
had adverse reactions from that nothing

95
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,360
seemed to be working they kind of get to

96
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,840
that definition when they've tried

97
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,040
everything else done all the tests and

98
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,000
still don't know exactly what's going on

99
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,598
well it's a really large nervous system

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,360
and when my brother said this stuff can

101
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,280
be used as medicinal means I started to

102
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,000
look at cannabis uh from a very

103
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,598
medicinal standpoint um had understood

104
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,318
that it was around and certainly was you

105
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:40,639
know aware of the topic in a

106
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,079
recreational type of sense which I think

107
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,839
medicinal and recreational are two

108
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,719
different labels for tax purposes at

109
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,479
this point it's all for physiological

110
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,000
impact um look at those studies that

111
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,479
have been done kind of take an approach

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,158
like the schaer commission and really

113
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,280
start to look how safe is this molecule

114
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,318
or sets of molecules what makes this

115
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,840
very medically beneficial to so many

116
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,119
people and how harmful might it be and

117
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,598
when you look at all the research that

118
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,878
have been done even up to that point

119
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,438
it's pretty pretty easy for me to see as

120
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,560
a scientist this is one of the most

121
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:13,239
effective types of compounds we can find

122
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,719
it's very uh benign to the human body

123
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,639
because it's offered in a whole plant

124
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,319
type fashion and we really don't know a

125
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,079
great deal about all the therapeutic

126
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,560
benefits but all of these early studies

127
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,319
are saying it has benefits for any numer

128
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,600
like numerous number of ailments or

129
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,560
physiological responses and you come to

130
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,080
find out that the endo can aboid system

131
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,519
was really only discovered in the early

132
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,198
'90s natural molecules anandamide and

133
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,240
endoc canabo were only found in the

134
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,120
early '90s and we haven't really gotten

135
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,079
a good handle on being able to research

136
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,160
understand and fully appreciate that

137
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,879
whole type of system we now know it's a

138
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,039
good system for regulating balance

139
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,038
within the body and it seems like that

140
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:53,399
is key to so many different things that

141
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:56,240
are causing the root problems of the

142
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:58,918
ailments from inflammation to all sorts

143
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,759
of other you know irritations and how

144
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:02,639
can I sleep better my mood could be

145
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,879
improved and then fundamental

146
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,519
physiological processes like cell growth

147
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,800
blood cell growth and things of that

148
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,639
type so when I looked at this and said

149
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,759
wow there's like this enormous amount of

150
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,478
opportunity and potential Botanical

151
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,080
offer this ability to be very friendly

152
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,478
and healthy um and very easy on the body

153
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,918
it's not a single molecule where you see

154
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:22,879
a lot of people with hands fulls of

155
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:24,959
pharmaceuticals and that's because well

156
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,439
one solved the problem that I thought

157
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,959
you had but caused side effects and I

158
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,759
needed to give you three other things to

159
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,478
mitigate some of the side effects

160
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,038
they're trying to mimic a plant in some

161
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:34,918
respects like if I can give you four or

162
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,000
five or 10 different things you can find

163
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,159
your state of balance so cannabis

164
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,759
impacting with the endoc canabo system

165
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,639
and the body's homeostasis and balance

166
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,240
looking at this body of science I just

167
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,879
thought to myself this is really going

168
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,840
to be good for me CBD canabidol other

169
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,199
types of you know non- psychoactive

170
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:54,918
cannabinoids could be very beneficial

171
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,000
irritations of the bowel things like

172
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:58,519
Crohn's disease I had talked to other

173
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,240
people that were benefiting from the use

174
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:05,560
of THC and CBD was you know very very

175
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,918
rare to find so in the beginning of 2009

176
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,000
the idea was wow like you could really

177
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,038
make a very positive impact with

178
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,560
cannabis how would you do that and when

179
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,199
you start to go to dispensaries you

180
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,280
would see no one understands their

181
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,160
supply chain no one knows which products

182
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,559
they have and are they possibly

183
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,880
contaminated so plant has been bred a

184
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,280
lot for high THC how do we find the

185
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:29,279
other cultivars like CBD or CBG thcv and

186
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,719
other things only when a laboratory

187
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,439
exists could you start to direct

188
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,680
cultivation efforts and breeding efforts

189
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,199
to other types of plants only when

190
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,840
you're there could you start to protect

191
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,800
against pesticide exposures

192
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,000
microbiological contaminations and

193
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,879
really protect public health and safety

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,199
so our thought was there's not a lot of

195
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,240
scientists out here in the game I'm

196
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,160
seemingly getting some somewhat of a a

197
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,759
green light to say if you think you can

198
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,000
help people and really do this the right

199
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,800
way and Usher this into society in a

200
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,800
safe effective fashion um that would be

201
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,720
of interest and we will kind of tolerate

202
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,918
that and let that let that go at that

203
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,280
point so the calculation was this is an

204
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:07,799
enormous risk uh probably throwing away

205
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,399
a career path uh down the pharmaceutical

206
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,079
path not really sure what this means but

207
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,679
I I think that there's enough of an

208
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,318
opportunity to help so many people to be

209
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,160
a good scientist and really make a

210
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,439
positive impact in an environmentally

211
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,120
and ecologically friendly way that it

212
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,680
was worth that potential risk that we

213
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,759
could go out there people would want to

214
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,639
hear from educated intelligent

215
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,240
sophisticated scientists um and make

216
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,319
sure that we were able to do what we

217
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,879
wanted to do and and inform and educate

218
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,240
many people so without understanding

219
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,599
formal education or formal knowledge

220
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,120
base about what's in the products what's

221
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:44,360
going on with the products what people

222
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,280
are actually being benefited by which

223
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,158
products we can't really further um

224
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,079
develop and utilize this plant to the

225
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:52,759
best of it best of all of our abilities

226
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:55,719
and to the maximum utility that it has

227
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,439
to offer and when lawmakers uh State

228
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Regulators or other people have to make

229
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,120
decisions about what the people want and

230
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,159
what they voted on they need to be

231
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,000
informed and and they can't go to school

232
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:06,680
for seven years and find an education

233
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,279
that's going to help them understand

234
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,759
each of those sections I mean they just

235
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,399
don't have that kind of time so they

236
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,840
have to look towards informed uh experts

237
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,120
in that kind of sense and we thought

238
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,478
that would be a great part of our

239
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,158
service would be to provide educational

240
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:21,478
information to anyone that would want it

241
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:23,478
whether it's a lawmaker regulator law

242
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,680
enforcement type people individual

243
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:27,598
patients doctors and just the general

244
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,240
public at large how can we help most

245
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,158
people understand what's going on with

246
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,360
this plan or science in general and

247
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,639
really start to introduce people to

248
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,158
things that I hear now they're like well

249
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,679
I really kind of didn't pay that much

250
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:40,439
attention to science in school but I

251
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,000
wish I would have because it's really

252
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,800
interesting to me now and I really have

253
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,080
a great interest in seeing how this is

254
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,399
impacting things and we're not going to

255
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,680
understand things until the scientists

256
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,080
get involved so we thought at that point

257
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,679
if we're going to help catalyze change

258
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,639
in the best possible Direction it would

259
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,679
be good to go ahead and start some sort

260
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,319
of service entity that provided at least

261
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:01,439
testing to begin with and that was kind

262
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
of how we got

263
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:05,009
