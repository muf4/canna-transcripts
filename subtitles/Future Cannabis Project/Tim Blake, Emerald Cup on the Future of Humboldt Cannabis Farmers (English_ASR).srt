1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
I want to now turn it over to Tim who

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:05,250
had a very interesting perspective on

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,628
taxes and issues dealing with the farms

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,970
up north and what's happening to them

5
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:09,990
because of the tax crunch for lack of a

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,000
better word so if you could kind of

7
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,019
explain what's going on and and how

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,548
you're seeing that world right now

9
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,780
because it was to me it was fascinating

10
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,309
because being in Southern California and

11
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,559
dealing with a lot of indoor growers and

12
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,629
distributors and banks I'm not seeing

13
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:26,038
that the landscape that you're seeing in

14
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:28,140
the trenches well it's even larger than

15
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,230
attacked that she was it's a it's a

16
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,558
calamity you look four years ago we

17
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,600
brought up about 400 people to Eureka to

18
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,859
have a gathering of the supervisors in

19
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,270
the fire department everybody to talk

20
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:40,350
about how we're gonna brace cannabis and

21
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,910
there was a standing ovation at the end

22
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,939
it was an incredible experience

23
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:46,859
last week the BCC came up to Humble to

24
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,359
you know do their Roadshow and there

25
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,058
were less than 35 people in the audience

26
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,320
there was nobody showed up no one there

27
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:53,820
were more people from the state than

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,590
they were there and I explained to them

29
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,539
that's because they've given up there's

30
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,670
no hope there's like you Justin talked

31
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,920
about a grieving going on Swami talks

32
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,239
about a thousand cuts

33
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,219
you basically have people that it's a

34
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,890
perfect storm where it wasn't just the

35
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:09,539
taxes it is the taxes but it's the land

36
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,030
use you've got the cultivators that have

37
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,170
to now apply to building codes you

38
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,239
you've got them having to deal with

39
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,560
water boards up north you could get away

40
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,158
with doing whatever you wanted for a

41
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,049
long time

42
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,850
excuse me because the water wars and

43
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,990
Fish and Game weren't in now that they

44
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:23,548
are in it's like they used to fly

45
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:25,228
helicopters and then you had to go get a

46
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,040
warrant prove that you could go in there

47
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:26,459
and they go to a lot of trouble with

48
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,590
cops

49
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,780
now you just fly over with Google map

50
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,250
you see it on a computer you send the

51
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,500
ten to twenty thousand dollar okay fine

52
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,328
tell them they gotta shut down and they

53
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,950
have to so they're sending out hundreds

54
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:40,078
of notices throughout Humboldt its

55
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,000
sheddy and Trinity and Mendocino they're

56
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,949
shutting down the markets the people

57
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,438
that have been here for 40 50 60 years

58
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,240
doing this if you looked at the size of

59
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,039
Mendocino on Humboldt rainbow triangle

60
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,780
it's larger than what most the small

61
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,430
states in this country if this was like

62
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,228
they said this was a coalition with coal

63
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,329
farmers or if this was a farming issue

64
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:58,739
in Kansas there's more farmers being

65
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:00,059
wiped out in the Emerald triangle that

66
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:01,859
there are in Kansas or any place where

67
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,450
they're subsidizing farm farm labor

68
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,679
requirement are those farmers having

69
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,969
trouble even getting through the

70
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,829
licensing process are they getting

71
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:09,000
licensed locally at the state what

72
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,409
you're talking about that you've got

73
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,199
less than 300

74
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:15,259
licensed farms and medicine

75
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,848
less than 400 and humble there they're

76
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:18,649
having a very challenging time because

77
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:19,848
of you know Edie Rosenthal said it we

78
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,129
argue years ago it's true

79
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:24,289
Humboldt Mendocino they weren't made for

80
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:26,239
traditional farming the land steep

81
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:27,500
there's no soil lack of water

82
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,060
you know it's challenging but then

83
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,310
you've got deserts out here that are

84
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,689
bringing 500 thousand square foot farms

85
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,189
in and they're taking the water from the

86
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,239
Sierras or wherever else they're taking

87
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:37,459
it from and they're not in trouble but

88
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,319
the landowners up in Mendocino can't use

89
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,360
their own water so between the building

90
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:42,949
codes the taxes everything you're

91
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,239
basically going to look at 75% of the

92
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:47,060
people that built this energy are gonna

93
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,259
be gone and in addition to that you got

94
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,699
the micro businesses and they're not

95
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:51,590
letting people do home micro businesses

96
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:52,879
for the most part so the product makers

97
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,729
those small people that did all that are

98
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,348
gone too so I'm excited about 64 I voted

99
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:58,548
for it with the ona and everything else

100
00:02:57,348 --> 00:02:59,899
I know we're gonna be in a great world

101
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:01,579
the consumers are gonna get the best

102
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,959
products they can ever hope for we're

103
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:04,640
gonna have you know cost-effective

104
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,140
medicine people are going to jail I'm a

105
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,208
huge advocate for all the people rotting

106
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:09,439
away in jails across this country and so

107
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,420
I don't want to say it's negative it's a

108
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,919
great thing we're going into but he

109
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:14,419
asked about what we're seeing for the

110
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:16,578
small farmers and small product makers

111
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:19,328
and it is a an extinction event that

112
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:19,329
they're going through right now
