1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Josh Gordon got spent ten times or

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,278
something like that Ricky Williams took

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,290
a year off to go on sabbatical to smoke

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,939
and he knew something we didn't know was

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,468
like okay my body's getting beat down I

6
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,169
need you gonna fix it and repair it and

7
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:14,730
I didn't realize the benefits of its

8
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,710
allies myself startup are taking it and

9
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,690
I realized that you know staying calm

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,250
being able to sleep being able to eat

11
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,750
you know sometimes when you're nervous

12
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,189
or you're frustrated or you're injured

13
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,899
you're you're depressed something you

14
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,240
don't have the same eating habits and

15
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,858
you eat bad or you're impulsively eating

16
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:29,848
but now like when you you get the

17
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,300
munchies I know if you've had much

18
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,579
before

19
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,750
but you eat I'm not sure I have healthy

20
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,000
food in my house but you know I'm eating

21
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,799
properly and eating eating more than

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,039
what I would if I was stressed out I'm

23
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:44,369
curious to find out what they do in the

24
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,890
NFL if you are caught smoking you hit a

25
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:48,570
little bit on with Gordon but what do

26
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,460
they do what are the protocols and what

27
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,980
are the protocols in place to protect

28
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,850
the player and house that'll go down or

29
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:55,259
you get fined

30
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,969
first offense you get fined you then

31
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:58,500
they put you in the substance abuse

32
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,058
program so you have to pee in a cup

33
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,710
every week probably three times a week

34
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:03,269
it's um

35
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,338
I've seen people go through it they hate

36
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,320
it's the worst but um yeah you get fine

37
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:10,019
and then second offense you get a

38
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,389
four-game suspension and then you get

39
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:13,589
put into the program and you have to you

40
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,439
know meet with the psychologist and

41
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,868
whatnot and then um third offense I

42
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,779
think it's a eight-game suspension and a

43
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:24,299
fine and you could possibly get conduct

44
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,489
detrimental so it escalates each time

45
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,200
you do it but I mean Josh Gordon was

46
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:30,420
continually getting in trouble for

47
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,130
smoking weed and I mean he was just

48
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,570
always ready to play every game he was

49
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,280
there and ready to play and I think that

50
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:37,828
cannabis was a huge part of his ability

51
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,560
to be relaxed and comfortable and he

52
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:42,289
just he moved effortlessly and I swear

53
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,810
to God it's because of cannabis but uh

54
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,670
yeah I mean he just they don't really

55
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,350
want to get rid of you because you smoke

56
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,579
weed but they have their rules that they

57
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:52,798
have in place that they have to adhere

58
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,809
to which is kind of to me it shows that

59
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,189
that they want to allow it but they

60
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,829
can't allow it because the backpressure

61
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:01,529
they get from the Jenner plug I think

62
00:01:57,828 --> 00:02:03,059
but they'll prescribe opioids quickly

63
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,579
yeah in a heartbeat here take this tour

64
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,200
tall get in there how can that be change

65
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:10,299
or how do you see that changing in the

66
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,490
future I think it's just going to have a

67
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,930
the NFL Players Union has to rally

68
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,700
together behind the people who have the

69
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,240
lawsuits against NFL for the damage has

70
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:18,869
been done

71
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,250
so there's walking evidence of people in

72
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,509
the community now that are former

73
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,129
players their walk around with pain that

74
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,959
have problems with their body because of

75
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,219
all the opiates they've taken and all

76
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,020
the stuff they put in their body I mean

77
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:32,259
I was a time where I was playing a game

78
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,719
and it was a really good year we were 14

79
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:37,569
and 2 but we were just playing at a high

80
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,159
level and I was putting DMSO and

81
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:41,289
ketoprofen on my body and DMS though

82
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,939
it's not clear by the FDA it's not good

83
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:45,189
for your body I don't know what the side

84
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:46,419
effects are probably in another 20 years

85
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:48,969
all right I have another leg growing out

86
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:50,979
of my body I don't know but um whatever

87
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:52,240
it took to be on the field that's what

88
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:53,859
everybody's mentalities I can't lose my

89
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,939
job I'll do whatever so if you got this

90
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,140
I'll take you give it to me I want to

91
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:58,930
feel better I want to I want to be able

92
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:00,279
to work and players are not gonna stand

93
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,319
up for themselves they're so focused on

94
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,819
trying to survive that they're not

95
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,139
focused on what the bodies

96
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,819
what damage is being done and the

97
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:09,219
long-term effects of it so I think the

98
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,139
the alumni has to jump back in and say

99
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:12,370
you know what look at my body I'm 55

100
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:13,989
years old and people are dying from

101
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,159
heart attacks and do they don't know why

102
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,530
but it's because of all the stuff they

103
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,620
put in their body people are going to

104
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:24,400
having dementia at 60 Alzheimer's it's a

105
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,219
high prevalence of people who have brain

106
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,870
issues and they're just now sort of

107
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:30,969
rolling out packages to help with that

108
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,439
disability plan but there's a lot of

109
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:34,599
lawsuits still against the NFL because

110
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:36,310
of that and I think that they would just

111
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,560
look at the books and say if we start

112
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,140
allowing people to take CBD start

113
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,640
allowing people to use cannabis there's

114
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,719
a lot of money that saves us in the long

115
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,039
run so I mean from a business

116
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,050
perspective I would just look at the

117
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,979
brass tacks of the numbers and just say

118
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,450
you know what it's probably more

119
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:51,549
profitable for us to do this and they

120
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:53,109
say oh well you know they're smoking

121
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,240
weed and they're promoting weed and it's

122
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,760
promoting it to the kids well say well

123
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,920
what about all the beer commercials you

124
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,299
have out here we're all other damn Coors

125
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,949
Light you passed down in the stadium

126
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,510
they see daddy drink all the time and

127
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:06,669
daddy gets mad selling yeah mommy that's

128
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:08,219
a problem but you don't see daddy smoke

129
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:10,509
weed and going yell at mommy

130
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:12,939
I'm not just being advocate in that on

131
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:14,530
that fashion but I mean just from from

132
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,600
plain and simple just looking at what's

133
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,100
going on I think this need to step up

134
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,129
and say you know what this is the

135
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,660
problem let's fix it I mean it's just

136
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:23,629
it's going to come from the community

137
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,130
that people who are actually live

138
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:26,750
like living in the pain that are using

139
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:28,519
it they had to use the proper language

140
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,720
and their speaking and sort of convince

141
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,719
people that this is the right way to go
