1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,189
a lot of my passion is in farming and

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,859
teeming with microbes and you know and

3
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,629
just the love that cannabis gives you

4
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,368
back when you give it love is just so

5
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:28,410
empowering you know and you see it come

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,599
out and but but it's fascinating with

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,579
your dry and caring cos you put such a

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,409
long period of time and energy and

9
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,210
effort and love and intention into

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,699
growing a plant it's so fascinating how

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,308
in the last week of harvest and like

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,739
drying carrying you can take your like a

13
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,808
plus plus and turn it into C and it

14
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,780
smell like hey you know and it's

15
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:50,250
fascinating how perishable of a of a

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,320
plant cannabis is really when it comes

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,609
down to it is you know so much and how

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,070
you set up the drying and curing you

19
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,109
know it almost you know put you I mean

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,939
cuz if you if you bag plant you know if

21
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,829
it's crispy and dry on the outside and

22
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,179
yet there it's tons of moist in the

23
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:08,579
middle and you bag everything up too

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,229
soon and then like you just let it sit

25
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,868
for too long and all of a sudden the

26
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:14,368
moisture just bombs and kills and it

27
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:16,379
smells like hay from then on you can't

28
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:17,728
really do much to get it back well you

29
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:19,798
can do certain things and you know

30
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:21,900
really moisturize it but it's just it's

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,060
amazing how how how big of a hit you

32
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,950
take you've got multi-phase very this is

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,140
hilarious because it's like you've got

34
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,210
multiples and you're playing around with

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,819
the moisture content it's like you know

36
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:36,569
you have from from whole plant to hangar

37
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:39,149
to buck down you have paper gift plastic

38
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,548
you know it's like you know eventually

39
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,380
someday we'll have glass and curing you

40
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,850
know

41
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:47,649
I don't know anybody that's doing all

42
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:50,390
jar Curie yeah but but I do know that

43
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,520
you know it's like when I'm taking yeah

44
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:55,400
but I'm taking my eight plus plus right

45

and come back you know it cause it's

49
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:08,538
like it's inconvenient for me to get to

50
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,280
that space you don't like I'll have

51
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:12,530
someone else when I go and check that

52
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,750
cannabis turns out to be a much less of

53
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,969
a quality the Canada secured on site

54
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,870

forgiven

74
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:58,259

75
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:03,030
outdoor he doesn't think is it's all

76
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:04,739
about or in paper bags in the Attic you

77
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,598
know and it's like it's right next to

78
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,280
their room so it's like but then I take

79
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:10,078
you know so I can take an entire harvest

80
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,180
and put it in you know and then lay it

81
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:13,829
out on all the floors and it cure and

82
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,439
then I take it out of there dump it back

83
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:17,849

gets trimmed from there

87
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:24,628
but sometimes the trim goes back in the

88
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,209
paper you're not saying before then it

89
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:28,709
goes into turkeys and sealed up and and

90
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,639
how is it being trimmed so many people

91
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,209
will just let it be

92
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:37,169
just fuckin yes it you know or put it

93
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:44,430
through trim machines like I like those

94
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:46,500
Catholics or my friends you know me and

express itself to its folks

100
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,009
I don't take pictures of developing

101
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:00,598
tribe trichomes and show them up because

102
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:03,289

what gives me so many ways - which is a

106
00:04:07,258 --> 00:04:11,339
repetition repetition one of my friends

107
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,889

115
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,169
people if they do it improperly you know

116
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,330

124
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,169
hard and from that moment I learned and

125
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:52,759
I chopped everybody from now on that now

126
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:54,500
that one that because it's like sake

127
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,240
dude each time that you're opening a bag

128
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,470
to like take a look at and smell and

129
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,210
then you just you're just ripping you

130
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,400
Olin you're just ripping all the buds

131
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:06,079
off or the whole the trikes off buds you

132
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,759
know that are like to become Kinston to

133
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,168
smashed against each other just so you

134
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,149
could take a look at it and it's just

135
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:13,250
amazing how how quick that degrades a

136
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:15,109
pound and how quick the bag appeal after

137
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,579
six people doing that you know could

138
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,830
ever two changes you know and it's like

139
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:22,879
you know respect to the trike beard you

140
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:24,109
know it's like dude no harm technique to

141
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,180
cuz we're always hanging around the

142
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,910
quarters it'll be something somebody

143
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,379
throws us like ten bags of G we want to

144
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,270
pick the one that we like and then we're

145
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:34,490
done with it we like to just suck it all

146
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:37,370
out spin it twist it you hand it back

147
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,560
you're done and it looks like here look

148
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:44,240
there's no oxygen in there so that

149
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:49,668
you're it's going to store better no

164
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,819
properly and he'll run our stuff that's

165
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,259
not it's not done well just because he

166
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:34,209
was do you know you just want the

167
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,740
relationship was to do it but I could

168
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:43,089
tell he'd rather be doing something else

169
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:45,728
it's like when he finds something that

170
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:48,219
he really really likes super odd and

171
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:51,370
he's he's not afraid to tell you you're

172
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,289
curing like shit so tell me some of what

173
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,160
he's saying or some of the stuff he's

174
00:06:53,288 --> 00:07:00,519
educated you on in terms of like as a

175
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,789
hash maker like what he's looking at as

176
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:07,000
these plants drying here I mean you know

177
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:10,930
it's it's like he's a fine china dealers

178
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,899
right so it's like he's less involved in

179
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,939
the specifics around ventilation

180
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:19,060
humidity control things of that nature

181
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:23,379
like I mean ideally I think we would all

182
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:25,569
be in stone floor wood wall buildings or

183
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:27,550
even cob building I think ideally in his

184
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:30,579
world we would all be bundling

185
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,710
everything and then just like setting it

186
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:35,379
like away from everything with like very

187
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:38,319
minimal airflow and then going back and

188
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:40,509
beating it on Civ uncivilized you know

189
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,610
like and and it's beating the living

190
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:45,519
shit out of it and scoop sweeping and

191
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,319
scooping and if I see if that's that's

192
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:53,258
where you see him get passionate right

193
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:57,668
he's I mean yes he respects flower but

194
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:59,169
he doesn't he know he wants to Trek he

195
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:03,189
respects my he's like oh that's really

196
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:05,079
pretty but he is a he's gonna what he

197
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:07,569
wants to be the one that brutalizes it's

198
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:09,550
attractive yeah he wants to be the one

199
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:12,339
that does it he wants as many of them as

200
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:14,620
possible in one area to go through that

201
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:16,029
process so it's it's when he's walking

202
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,120
through the rooms walk through

203
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:20,448
everything he's like don't touch that

204
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,329
don't walk there

205
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:25,370
you know turn that fan around you know

206
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:27,498
don't you like like like these are

207
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:30,680
things he's saying you know basically

208
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:33,639
you want it to develop just like that

209
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,370
nobody touch don't throw it into totes

210
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:39,500
you know he calls trimmer stupid you

211
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,870
know you're like all the time us stupid

212
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,969
you know like you know he gets really

213
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,278
frustrated we lifted the trim bins and

214
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:50,300
he sees all the amazing things it's a

215
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:52,490
waiter wrong yeah yeah and you know in

216
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:55,039
so many ways to it's funny how like you

217
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,959
know the art of the you know hashish in

218
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,759
you know kind of like French cheese but

219
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,289
but the heart of the farmer you know

220
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,419
it's just that all the intuitive things

221
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:04,250
that we've come upon you know figuring

222
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:05,659
out almost intuitively from this

223
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,159
relationship of the plan and the plan on

224
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,838
was communicating with us teaching us

225
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,299
these things because I find it really

226
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,380
fast is now science is around you know

227
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:14,479
testing and we're able to help

228
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:16,789
substantiate or qualify these certain

229
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,409
aspects you know it's it's an almost

230
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:21,528
just like that much more proving like

231
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:23,448
why people figured it out all along long

232
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:25,189
ago in this certain way you know and and

233
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:26,539
you know it's it's it's it's a trip

234
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,300
because they cannabis with terpenes you

235
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:30,828
know there's you know we tested after

236
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:33,318
tennis for about 34 different terpenes

237
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:34,909
but but what we see of you know of all

238
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:37,789
those terpenes we only really ever see

239
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:40,519
between five and nine of them ever show

240
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:42,679
up in any real amount and and of the

241
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:44,720
nine there's only really like three or

242
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:47,568
four that ever show up as the dominant

243
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,860
or codominant terpene and then some of

244
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:51,799
the other ones will be there in very

245
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,028
small secondary tertiary amounts but

246
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,318
what we're talking about like is like

247
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:55,129
and there's and there's two different

248
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:56,059
types Turkish right there's the

249
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:58,220
monoterpenes

250
00:09:56,059 --> 00:10:00,109
and sesqui terpenes right and so the

251
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,420
difference really is the monoterpenes

252
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,980
boil off at much lower temperatures as

253
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:05,929
opposed sesqui terpenes which boil off

254
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,920
the higher temperatures and so so with

255
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:08,929
the monoterpenes

256
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:10,909
those are the ones that are there in the

257
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:12,349
most amounts in any really given any

258
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:13,759
given strain so you know so you talking

259
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,409
about limonene you're talking about

260
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,720
pining you're talking about Turpin

261
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:19,578
Helene so so so Turpin names the turfing

262
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,250
high in like Jack and trainwreck and

263
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:24,620
sage Durbin Zeta you know a lot of those

264
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,000
kind of like quotes sativa type strain

265
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,039
you know and that's predominantly

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,529
turpentine and then there's little other

267
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:32,839
terpenes but predominator friendly and

268
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,389
then and so then you have you have mere

269
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,220
seen also as a monoterpene and you have

270
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:40,669
little rule which is lavender as

271
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,259
atropine but but so all those terpenes

272
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:44,479
which are the ones that ever show up is

273
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:47,179
the primary secondary Turkey you know

274
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,159
they are the ones that go away and

275
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:51,229
volatilize that the quickest whenever

276
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:53,449
you know you're introducing them to

277
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,370
prolong like improper heating kind of

278
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,100
what have you you know it's like it's

279
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,779
drying in a barn you know that super hot

280
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,920
and unable to keep controlled

281
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,839
temperature in humidity you can

282
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,949
immediately drop some rich turbines and

283
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,019
you're sesqui terpenes like vinegar

284
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,850
awfully and inhuman lean will then kind

285
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:10,669
of concentrate all the other ones are

286
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:13,550
boiling off so you can almost alter the

287
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:16,189
turbo file of the archetype of the

288
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:17,689
strain you know through kind of improper

289
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,640
drying curing because then all of a

290
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,310
sudden like say the you know if it's if

291
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:23,899
it's like you know you know yeah like

292
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:25,759
Dutch treat or something which is like

293
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:27,799
you know Turpin lean and a little like

294
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,529
beta-carotene all of a sudden it could

295
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,209
become Turpin lean and like almost equal

296
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:34,490
amount of beta-carotene you know and and

297
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,720
so so just in the process of drying and

298
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,360
carrying you know you can vary

299
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,920
significantly alter the expression of

300
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,190
what the plants supposed to be just from

301
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,189
you know

302
00:11:48,220 --> 00:12:01,139
