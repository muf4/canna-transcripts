3
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,609
we've got a great panel together today

4
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:31,729
to discuss CBD which is such a hot topic

5
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:34,149
and there's a lot to discuss we've got

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,590
pretty much from every kind of angle

7
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:39,079
we've got an amazing researcher here

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,690
we've got a patient that every day is

9
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,960
involved with using CBD to heal the

10
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:46,039
ailments that CBD can be so great for so

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,469
many things

12
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,049
we've also got a Jessica that is

13
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:53,929
involved in making products and

14
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:56,058
developing products with CBD and Nick

15
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:59,179
who consults in the industry and can

16
00:00:56,058 --> 00:01:02,750
actually build the platforms and and

17
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:05,530
build outs to derive and produce CBD I

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:08,509
did real quick they'll want to go into

19
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,939
the reasons and and kind of something

20
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:13,819
that came to me today and throughout

21
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:16,158
this event of why we all need to still

22
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:18,589
hold a medical recommendation

23
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,740
we're on eclis dealing with it at this

24
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,060
event straightforward with the fact that

25
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:25,849
they're trying to say that we cannot

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,280
medicate and they point to prop 64 and

27
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:30,379
the fact that prop 64 says you cannot

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,890
smoke in public places

29
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:36,459
the fact is prop 215 and is still a law

30
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,810
voted on by the people and it absolutely

31
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:42,169
authorizes us to medicate anywhere else

32
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,450
you can smoke tobacco and if you can

33
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,579
smoke tobacco you can you can smoke your

34
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:50,120
medicine if you hold a recommendation if

35
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:53,870
you're smoking cannabis has a 21 and up

36
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,760
recreational consumer then then no Prop

37
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,310
64 says you cannot smoke in public

38
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,140
places but the thing is though on

39
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,728
private property that they do have the

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,799
right to tell anybody to leave the

41
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:05,179
private property and of course your

42
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,520
recommendations not going to override

43
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,780
that but this came to me and Susan

44
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,068
talked to me about it and I think it's

45
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,049
something that we all need to remember

46
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:15,169
is that we do still have our medical

47
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:17,450
rights and we should absolutely all have

48
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:19,250
a recommendation so that uh you know we

49
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:21,649
don't get into this this argument in the

50
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,459
future and so wanted to bring that up

51
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,750
first so first I think the most

52
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,830
important thing to do is we'll go down

53
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,370
the line and let everybody introduce

54
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,469
themselves and give a little background

55
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,129
and won't take it from there my name is

56
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:38,050
Jessica Asaph and a few years ago I am

57
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:41,018
forgetting my MBA at Harvard I finally

58
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,870
felt confident to follow my heart and

59
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:46,330
pursue cannabis as my career so I came

60
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,629
to LA and started a community called

61
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:51,310
cannabis feminist because in my heart I

62
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:55,229
believe cannabis could be the first

63
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,969
billion-dollar industry run by women and

64
00:02:55,229 --> 00:03:00,848
just watching the female entrepreneurs

65
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:03,579
come to life has been one of the best

66
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:06,119
experiences of my life and now I'm

67
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:08,590
working on a line of hemp derived

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,360
cannabinoid prod at wellness products

69
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,360
because I really want to get

70
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:17,170
cannabinoids into the hands of women all

71
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,940
over the country who are taking xanax

72
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:21,250
and drinking white wine when they could

73
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:23,289
be taking plant medicine so that's why

74
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:30,549
I'm here the line is called prema and

75
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:35,530
I'm focusing on education first hi my

76
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:39,730
name is Chelsea I'm actually a DJ and so

77
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:43,568
I came into this space through my own

78
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:46,629
condition which is epilepsy I was

79
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:49,179
diagnosed with a form of epilepsy called

80
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:52,659
juvenile myoclonic epilepsy at the age

81
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,549
of 15 and epilepsy had already been a

82
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:57,068
huge part of my life because I have an

83
00:03:54,549 --> 00:04:00,099
older sister with a more severe form of

84
00:03:57,068 --> 00:04:02,560
the condition and she lives in the UK

85
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:05,798
and she lives in full-time care and she

86
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,650
can have anywhere from you know 5 to 70

87
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,019
seizures a day and and and you know

88
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:14,760
often has grand mal seizures falls to

89
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:18,220
the floor without any warning at all so

90
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,988
as I said when I was diagnosed I you

91
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,660
know had it had already kind of this

92
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:27,189
condition had been something that I had

93
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:30,310
experienced very intensely and I was put

94
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:33,370
on pharmaceutical medication at fifteen

95
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,949
a cocktail of different drugs which I

96
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,860
experienced some pretty horrific side

97
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,608
effects from for those of you that have

98
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:47,989
taken anticonvulsants you will know

99
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:49,948
and two years ago I started to take CBD

100
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:52,738
actually it was over two years ago two

101
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:54,569
and a half years ago and two years ago I

102
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:57,178
wound myself off of all my

103
00:04:54,569 --> 00:05:04,439
pharmaceutical medication and have not

104
00:04:57,178 --> 00:05:08,158
had one seizure since so so I come into

105
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:11,609
this space as a patient and and you know

106
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:13,558
have really in many ways over my life to

107
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:19,378
this plant so that is why I'm sitting

108
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:22,799
here today good afternoon I'm doctor

109
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:25,769
Annabel Manalo developmental biologist

110
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:27,149
and I was a government researcher for

111
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:29,749
the last seven years I was a lead

112
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:33,209
scientist on the largest chemotherapy

113
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:35,088
project in the world I like this because

114
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:37,468
we all have a story and I think that

115
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:39,928
ties us into this industry and I think

116
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:44,519
that's why a lot of us are here I had a

117
00:05:39,928 --> 00:05:46,948
son two years ago and he was born had a

118
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:47,389
stroke and was having over 200 seizures

119
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:50,549
a day

120
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:52,619
they removed 40% of his brain we were

121
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:57,658
told he would never walk talk you name

122
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:59,969
it you know ultimately I was very

123
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:01,438
conservative and never even looked into

124
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:03,629
cannabis I have a clinical trial

125
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,699
certification I'm like hey this is

126
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:08,459
federally unregulated I'm not trying

127
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,999
this stuff but as a mom I got pretty

128
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:13,228
desperate when I saw a six-month-old ii

129
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:15,360
couldn't do anything I mean he's six

130
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:19,199
months old still not smiling at you not

131
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,829
moving and that's what led me to do my

132
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,959
own research and study cannabis and

133
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:27,989
eventually made my own CBD oil that I

134
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,179
now have seven patents around and didn't

135
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:32,218
tell doctors didn't tell anyone but my

136
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:35,308
husband started giving it to my son and

137
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:37,649
he's two years old now still missing 40%

138
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:42,719
of his brain but he has no developmental

139
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:46,918
deficits so I'm in the space too because

140
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:50,038
I own I owe this space you know my

141
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,468
research my credibility and I'm here

142
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:54,389
today to advocate for it and to make

143
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:56,339
good relationships

144
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:59,579
to really educate and help people

145
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,979
understand why this is such a critical

146
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:09,870
industry not for the money but for what

147
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:11,490
it can do for this world Thanks well

148
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,590
good afternoon everyone my story is

149
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,780
definitely not as cool as those ones um

150
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:17,939
I'll probably represent like a different

151
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:20,879
voice in opinion and some of this I am a

152
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,620
disabled vet so equally owe much to this

153
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,360
plant

154
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,399
Wisconsin AG world to military to

155
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,050
Colorado at the right time 2016 and

156
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,310
started a small company helping like

157
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,500
with the business aspect of this

158
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,839
industry now also managed four different

159
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,129
venture funds and I mean just last week

160
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,719
I was in nine different countries in

161
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:39,060
Europe doing this sort of work for a

162
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,820
licensing so when it comes to the CBD

163
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,560
side I'm so thankful for the

164
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:52,889
possibilities of this but I also know

165
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:55,019
from an investment stand but it's not

166
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,819
necessarily doing it correctly so it's

167
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:58,620
trying to find the balance of business

168
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,060
cannabinoid science and like

169
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,560
endocannabinoids system research and

170
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,240
actually helping patients because at the

171
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,040
end of the day this is everything we do

172
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,259
this for all adults our patients to once

173
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,030
it's legal but what we do now matters

174
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,089
and for a lot of these patients and

175
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:13,349
their stories the businesses are not

176
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:15,060
representing this cannabinoid or like

177
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,350
this industry correctly and we're

178
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,699
thinking we've got to think long term in

179
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,710
our decisions for patients not just

180
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,819
today but deeply intergenerationally so

181
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:22,819
pleasure to be here

182
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:30,149
you know I think with with CBD you know

183
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:31,679
there has been a lot of information and

184
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:35,009
it has been such the craze and the

185
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:37,250
mainstream over really five years but in

186
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:40,469
the past three years we've really seen

187
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,360
development almost of an entirely side

188
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,778
industry that's definitely a part of

189
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,639
cannabis but it's become more known

190
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:50,490
almost as hemp derived CBD especially on

191
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,589
a national level can you guys speak to

192
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:56,039
your experience in the difference of

193
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:59,660
hemp derived CBD to the flower derived

194
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:01,948
CBD meaning deriving from the plant of

195
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:03,899
that when it when it is grown is since

196
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:06,059
Amelia and growing as a flower and not

197
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:09,269
an industrial production so what we're

198
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:12,208
dealing with now is layers and layers of

199
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:14,399
consumer confusion while also

200
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:17,938
experiencing a huge surge and buzz

201
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,970
around the term CBD without actually an

202
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:23,399
understanding what CBD is in my opinion

203
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,819
we should stop calling it CBD and

204
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:30,208
instead call it a cannabinoid and the

205
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:32,610
difference is while I agree that CBD is

206
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:35,609
a primary cannabinoid that we should

207
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,589
really focus on it's one of over a

208
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:41,850
hundred active compounds in the plant

209
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:43,920
and by calling it CBD we're putting so

210
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,600
much focus on a single molecule we're

211
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:49,528
forgetting about the entourage effect

212
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,629
the the fact that the compounds need

213
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:54,269
each other to activate and to work

214
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:56,519
synergistically with the body and I

215
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:58,919
think that what's happening is we're

216
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,350
almost showing consumers that we know

217
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,360
more than we actually do because there's

218
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,670
so much about the plant we do not yet

219
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,649
understand we don't understand how the

220
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:10,409
terpenes and the phenols and the

221
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,419
cannabinoids work together and how many

222
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,558
receptors we have in our bodies in fact

223
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,649
I was just in Israel this summer

224
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:18,568
speaking to dr. Rafael Missoula who

225
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:21,839
first discovered the endocannabinoid

226
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:23,759
system and isolated CBD and THC and when

227
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,680
I asked him about a potential third

228
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,959
receptor found in the body which was big

229
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,058
news this summer he was like honestly we

230
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,099
have no idea how many receptors we have

231
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:34,318
in our system and part of the beauty and

232
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,089
part of the magic with the plant is that

233
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:41,110
there isn't a lot we do not yet

234
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:43,689
understand so as experts or advocates or

235
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,999
users or patients we have to do a lot of

236
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:47,349
on-the-ground consumer education and we

237
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:49,480
have to help people understand what

238
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,839
they're actually looking for which is a

239
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,999
cannabinoid rich extract it's not just

240
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:58,029
CBD it's not just an isolated molecule

241
00:10:54,999 --> 00:11:01,420
it's a cannabinoid and active beyond

242
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:03,639
cannabinoids extract coming from either

243
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:05,289
the flowers of the cannabis or the hemp

244
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,539
plant as long as they're extracted from

245
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:09,338
the flowers and not the seeds because

246
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:11,438
now we're also seeing beauty products

247
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:13,959
made with hemp seed oil calling it hemp

248
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:15,998
oil calling it cannabinoids which is

249
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:18,998
doing a total disservice to the true

250
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:20,350
benefit of the plan so we need education

251
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:23,199
we need to start using the word

252
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,480
cannabinoid more than using the word CBD

253
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:27,549
because that's also misleading a single

254
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,370
isolate is completely different effect

255
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:32,469
than a whole plant full spectrum extract

256
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,179
so in my mind it should really be a

257
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,309
cannabinoid conversation and where we

258
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:39,008
can get the best cannabinoids supported

259
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:41,230
by phenols and Inter peens and other

260
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:43,509
other molecules we do not yet understand

261
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,079
so just look for whole plant full

262
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:51,459
spectrum a broad spectrum in my opinion

263
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:54,458
and so I'm 100% agree there's the

264
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:56,528
synergistic benefit that we hear about

265
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:59,739
from a whole plant or a full hemp

266
00:11:56,528 --> 00:12:01,419
extract that you know is profound and we

267
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,399
haven't been able to define it but I

268
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:06,490
think that's just as important is there

269
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:10,589
our lack of research this industry's

270
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:13,720
been moving for the last 25 years and

271
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:15,879
we're just extracting and extracting and

272
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,550
extracting but that single isolate is

273
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:21,579
important because unless we isolate

274
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:23,740
every single cannabinoid we can't define

275
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:26,349
the synergistic benefit so we don't know

276
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,360
if some of these cannabinoids can turn

277
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,909
into THC we don't know what happens when

278
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,610
it gets decarboxylated and goes from an

279
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:34,838
acid form into a single form and most

280
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:38,350
importantly we don't know what happens

281
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:42,339
when it enters into our body so instead

282
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:44,740
of just saying hey you know everyone

283
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:46,439
just go all-in go for a full hemp

284
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,659
extract I think we need to have better

285
00:12:46,438 --> 00:12:50,240
standardization and understand what is

286
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:52,549
in

287
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,289
each hemp extract based on strain or

288
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:56,569
whatever you want to base that on make

289
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:59,509
sure that the quality is right and then

290
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:03,140
start building up some data even if it's

291
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:05,059
data within the user itself like hey you

292
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:07,220
know I got fibromyalgia I'm gonna start

293
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:09,169
trying CBD okay I'm gonna try a full

294
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,620
hemp extract what are the cannabinoids

295
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:14,809
in there that we do know about and what

296
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,120
may have helped me unless we have you

297
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:18,409
know 20 30 40 50 people a data

298
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,659
collection we're never going to know

299
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:28,100
what the synergistic benefit means not a

300
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:29,299
lawyer I like them a lot though so I

301
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,159
like to look at like the Controlled

302
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:32,838
Substances Act that clearly defines like

303
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:34,699
what is legal and what is not from like

304
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,100
a controlled one substance so it lists

305
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:41,920
cannabinoids all 117 known today CBD THC

306
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,690
AG all of them all the fun new ones and

307
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,039
when we look at like the farm bill 2014

308
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,480
farm bill I was probably the one who

309
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:49,189
toed the fucking line the biggest on

310
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,350
that with like a giant hemp project with

311
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,880
like tribal reservations you needed to

312
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,620
essentially have like State Department

313
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,149
of Agricultural approval and an

314
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,620
institution of higher education that had

315
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:59,389
the authority to work with the farm bill

316
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,700
to cultivate hemp for the extraction

317
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:04,250
thereof of seeds fibers holes like not

318
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,680
unpalatable female flowers which we all

319
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,958
know are so great anything that happened

320
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,479
after that point when you look at like

321
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:13,309
1961 UN conventions single conventions

322
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,740
on psychotropic substances even now like

323
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:17,778
whe Oh last week had a pretty good new

324
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,180
finding on this but everything CBD is

325
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:21,649
completely as illegal as THC and without

326
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:23,179
the Cole memo you don't really like

327
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:24,980
which doesn't really mean crap anymore

328
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:27,889
but we still follow those eight rules

329
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,659
was really important you essentially

330
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:31,669
like could not be doing extraction as a

331
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:34,278
business of CBD unless you had a state

332
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:36,139
licensed medical cannabis operation for

333
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:38,570
cultivation and extraction but then you

334
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:40,039
couldn't be selling like non THC

335
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:43,510
products like in Colorado is where we

336
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:45,939
originated so we started to test this

337
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:47,990
2014/15 is when they made the olls

338
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,970
decision letter in colorado that pretty

339
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:52,490
much stated that unless it was derived

340
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:54,560
from a state farm bill program or from a

341
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,879
state medical cannabis program you

342
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,828
couldn't be doing this sort of thing so

343
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:59,389
it's all completely illegal the 2018

344
00:14:57,828 --> 00:15:01,039
farm bill which it passes is going to

345
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:02,958
really carve out some great new things

346
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,379
for this but from a business standpoint

347
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,838
of the

348
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:07,849
definition you think cannabis and ham

349
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,979
kind of same thing biological definition

350
00:15:07,849 --> 00:15:11,509
of a species the ability to create

351
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:14,599
sexually viable offspring

352
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:15,979
I believe Bill Nye so cannabis you've

353
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:17,299
got like your great Dean's your poodles

354
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:19,908
like camp is the great day in poodle

355
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:21,588
bulldog Shih Tzu's mix them around the

356
00:15:19,908 --> 00:15:23,328
world you've had point three point four

357
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,829
or one percent based on these THC

358
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:26,568
thresholds which should have been THC a

359
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:29,838
but they didn't understand the science

360
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:31,878
there so legality of like you look at

361
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,259
and oka Stanley Brothers Bluebird a few

362
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,729
of those initial ones that some have now

363
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:37,369
had Canadian IPOs for over a hundred

364
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:40,999
million Canadian which is much less so

365
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:42,589
it's not as cool sounding but they're

366
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:45,229
doing some big things right now but also

367
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:47,209
when you look at the USDA and the EPA

368
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:50,209
USDA when they issued the warning

369
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:52,158
letters also with the FDA to like ninety

370
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,758
four CBD companies like hey we tested

371
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:54,558
your products there's not even

372
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,629
cannabinoids in them that's horrible

373
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:58,098
pressing credibility for a molecule or

374
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:59,720
something that's really doing amazing

375
00:15:58,099 --> 00:16:01,939
work that we're barely beginning to

376
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,739
understand but normally with CBD when I

377
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:05,478
look at it it's like not interested

378
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:07,489
because like from an investment

379
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:08,749
standpoint it's like market risk it's

380
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:11,269
not legal what they're doing we already

381
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:12,350
told the Linus in industry so now the

382
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:14,418
companies that are doing this correctly

383
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,769
understate programs or hemp programs

384
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:17,869
like to actually create this medicine

385
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:19,428
hopefully if we don't have a standards

386
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:20,778
program patient focused certification

387
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:22,548
like from the cannabis side from

388
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:24,048
Americans for safe access does a great

389
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:27,108
job for like cultivation extraction

390
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:29,688
retail GMP g AP global graph like all

391
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:30,889
those standards but right now we're in

392
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,688
this moment where we know it's helping

393
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,548
people we know the definitions no one's

394
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:36,379
following those rules practically other

395
00:16:34,548 --> 00:16:38,088
than a few companies and it's like how

396
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,829
do we actually create new companies to

397
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:42,459
help people knowing the rules

398
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:46,548
well touching on that I know that

399
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:49,608
California Nevada Oregon they are now

400
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:53,358
requiring a hanpan ler certificate when

401
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:55,309
selling CBD products so basically it's a

402
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:57,619
traceability factor where you have to

403
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:59,688
show where your hemp comes from I don't

404
00:16:57,619 --> 00:17:01,970
know how you show whether you're

405
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:07,038
extracting from the flower is damn I I

406
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:09,919
would hope that we just do it but you

407
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,838
know traceability leads to hemp where

408
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,379
that hemp is either shipped to or

409
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:17,179
extracted what that first certificate of

410
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:19,939
analysis shows which cannabinoid

411
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,920
terpenes are present as well as are

412
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,750
there any microbials pesticides the

413
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,990
whole nine and then you have your final

414
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,220
batch testing which also shows if

415
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,620
someone says there's a thousand

416
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,210
milligrams of CBD in there is there

417
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:33,889
really a thousand milligrams of CBD

418
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,470
because when you have a full hemp

419
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,970
extract or a whole plant I think that's

420
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,850
brilliant that you said we should call

421
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:43,940
it a cannabinoid product as opposed to a

422
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:46,039
CBD product because with the way it is

423
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,680
now you're only really getting maybe 60

424
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:51,889
70 percent CBD because it's so abundant

425
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,470
in hemp the rest of it is terpenes other

426
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:57,770
cannabinoids so it is a full extract

427
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:00,890
it's not really just CBD now if it is

428
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:04,190
99.9% CBD isolate and call it a CBD

429
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,930
product you know so that is you know

430
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,750
what is being required now in states

431
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:11,000
such as California Colorado where

432
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,099
marijuana is legalized they're trying to

433
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,160
kind of have the same standardizations

434
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:18,199
besides behind CBD a lot of companies do

435
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,480
not like it but I think that I think

436
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,460
it's phenomenal I think that you know as

437
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,200
a consumer when you're spending 200

438
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,960
bucks 300 bucks on a product you should

439
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,460
get something you can trust ya know and

440
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,350
you know where do you sell those

441
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,000
products so Colorado in all of those

442
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:33,889
states then even with the Department of

443
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,299
Ag license for hemp and a Department of

444
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,250
Health license for extraction and like

445
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:38,450
the handling they can't actually sell

446
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,920
those products and dispensaries in

447
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,600
Colorado because the only things that

448
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,190
can be sold in Colorado dispensaries or

449
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,959
these other states our marijuana

450
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,580
products through the like so then they

451
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,920
have to do the low CBD or the high CBD

452
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:50,539
low THC varieties through their cannabis

453
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,190
operations tracking metric all those

454
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:54,200
things to even have CBD products for

455
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,450
sale in Medical dispensaries or adult

456
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,890
use well but Nick I would say and I

457
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,299
would argue that you know for the

458
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,820
patient and actually for delivering

459
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:03,289
medicine to the patient that that is the

460
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:05,119
framework that has been set by the

461
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,970
regulatory agencies it's the framework

462
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:10,729
that actually allows for the patient to

463
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:12,710
get analytics that are guaranteed and

464
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,349
from the flower and this would go to

465
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,509
Chelsea as the patient you know

466
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:19,159
experiencing him derived CBD that you

467
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:20,269
can buy at any store or compared to what

468
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,610
you're gonna get out of a legal

469
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:24,049
dispensary that in California is more or

470
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:25,609
less gonna be guaranteed to come from

471
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:28,490
the flower I do hear stories of

472
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:29,548
dispensaries selling hemp derive CBD

473
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,499
which is mine

474
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:33,509
to me but people I have heard do that

475
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:35,159
but for the majority of our especially

476
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:36,960
our major brands are going to be derived

477
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:38,879
from the flower and as a patient what is

478
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,710
your experience I just wanted to add to

479
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:42,928
that I think it's always important as

480
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,909
well to look at this as a sort of global

481
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:46,399
issue you know and as you know I'm from

482
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:54,570
England and I split my time between

483
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:57,268
England England and New York and you

484
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:58,859
know due to my geographical postcode I'm

485
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:00,690
lucky enough that I have a medical

486
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:02,849
marijuana card you know I'm able to go

487
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,769
and speak with a physician that I trust

488
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:07,319
have an open conversation with someone

489
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,759
that's well informed I can trust the

490
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:10,648
product that I'm using you know that

491
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,499
it's well regulated that it standardized

492
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:16,969
that it's pharmaceutical grade but you

493
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:19,350
know when I initially started using CBD

494
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,970
it was derived from hemp I didn't know

495
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:22,099
what I was using where it come from I

496
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,989
didn't even know the difference between

497
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:27,349
CBD from from hemp versus whole plant

498
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:30,179
until and I and I went down the road of

499
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:32,428
self-medicating because my journey

500
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:35,879
started in England where it's Schedule

501
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:38,519
one and it's illegal and now I've

502
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:43,048
arrived at this point where you know I'm

503
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:44,638
using product that I can trust but

504
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:47,038
that's not forget when I get on the

505
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:49,648
airplane with my you know one-to-one and

506
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,509
my CBD the whole plant I you know I'm

507
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:55,439
breaking the law which is the most

508
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:58,769
ludicrous thing ever so that in itself

509
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,710
just I think almost you know sort of

510
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:03,298
sums up the the current landscape and

511
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,739
where we're at and it's always

512
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:07,349
interesting for me to come to California

513
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:09,058
and you know hearing these conversations

514
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,319
and just seeing how far ahead we are but

515
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:12,599
we have to remember where the rest of

516
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,519
the world is you know I think one of the

517
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,769
biggest issues that I'm seeing I forgot

518
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:19,618
to mention before that I'm also making a

519
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:21,569
documentary that is exploring the

520
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:25,408
medicinal medicinal cannabis climate

521
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:27,450
with a focus on on epilepsy through sort

522
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:30,359
of the personal lens of my own

523
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,788
experience and that of my sister but you

524
00:21:30,358 --> 00:21:34,888
know my sister doesn't have access to

525
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:36,239
this medicine she can't get on an

526
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:38,998
aeroplane because she's too sick to

527
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:40,499
travel so until you know there is a

528
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:43,200
product that it has been clinically

529
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:45,899
trialed she has no chance of

530
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:51,028
of being able to to use you know this

531
00:21:45,898 --> 00:21:54,569
this has a form of treatment and so yes

532
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:56,460
now that I'm using a twenty to one you

533
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:59,158
know high CBD straight from whole plant

534
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:02,490
the difference is just incomparable it

535
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:04,080
it's hard to sort of communicate that to

536
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:08,130
someone perhaps that that doesn't have

537
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,599
epilepsy but it's like I'm taking the

538
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,330
medicine that I really should you know

539
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:16,319
it's almost like it's a brain balancing

540
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:18,629
effect that using the the product that

541
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,609
really really works you know from for my

542
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,240
brain and for my body but one of the

543
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:26,788
issues that I think that I'm seeing

544
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,048
tremendously so in the UK is that you

545
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:29,519
know because of all these beautiful

546
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:32,339
anecdotal stories that people are

547
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:35,339
reading in the media it's creating this

548
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:38,278
buzz we know around CBD and and patients

549
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:40,980
are going to their local organic health

550
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:42,720
food store and buying a bottle of CBD to

551
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,058
treat their epilepsy and making really

552
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,159
poor decisions and you know jumping off

553
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:49,079
medicine and thinking that they're now

554
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,340
taking this product that's going to

555
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:52,918
treat their seizures and I think that

556
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:56,220
there we see the importance of Education

557
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:58,230
and that you know unlabeled is product

558
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,370
coming from and in the UK people aren't

559
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,159
even having this conversation

560
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:03,479
there's just at the point of wow this is

561
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,039
a form of treatment that can treat

562
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,558
seizures that's where we are in the UK

563
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:10,138
so I just think it you know it's so

564
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:12,329
important just to really begin to

565
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:14,879
educate people and about whole plant and

566
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:17,460
the difference between CBD from hemp I

567
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,860
also think we have to go a step further

568
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,169
and actually uphold some of the same

569
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:24,148
high standards from the natural foods

570
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:26,130
industry or the natural products

571
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:28,259
industry and carry that through the

572
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:31,049
entire production and manufacturing

573
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:32,700
product process because my fear coming

574
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:34,888
from ten years in the clean beauty

575
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:38,009
industry starting from the beginning and

576
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:41,298
watching it evolve is that we're also

577
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:44,869
doing a disservice to the plant by not

578
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:47,490
formulating the products in in a clean

579
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:50,250
sophisticated environment that upholds

580
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,109
certifications and standards that we

581
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,490
would feel comfortable with because it's

582
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:55,319
great that you have to test the active

583
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,460
but what about the final product what

584
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:58,710
about any content

585
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,569
or chemicals or pesticides that have

586
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:03,480
come in through the manufacturing

587
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:06,569
process that sometimes is happening in a

588
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,548
home or in a facility that isn't up to

589
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:10,710
our standards so I just think that as

590
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:12,628
the consumer and as the advocate we also

591
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,690
have to take a step further and actually

592
00:24:12,628 --> 00:24:18,230
make sure that the cannabinoids are how

593
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:22,019
safely within the final formulation

594
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:24,118
without any pesticides or chemicals or

595
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:25,470
industrial chemicals that are found in a

596
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:27,480
lot of the products we put on our skin

597
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:31,230
and in our bodies because I would hate

598
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,298
for this true medicine to be hidden by

599
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,028
ingredients that don't belong in our

600
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:38,460
products we still have a major problem

601
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:41,128
with access and with a patient being

602
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,139
able to get access to the whole plant

603
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:45,898
extraction and and maybe that is

604
00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:47,758
pointing to why we found loopholes to

605
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:49,859
find ways to extract from the legal

606
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,618
source of hemp however we're hearing

607
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:54,928
that it really isn't the true medicine

608
00:24:51,618 --> 00:24:56,999
for the patient and so you know what

609
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:59,399
that could do is seriously discredit

610
00:24:56,999 --> 00:25:00,899
cannabis moving into the world of

611
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:03,658
research moving into the world of

612
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:07,079
medicine and really also for the

613
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:08,879
consumer what is it that we can do as an

614
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,319
industry and I think this may be pointed

615
00:25:08,878 --> 00:25:12,089
more to Annabelle somebody that's really

616
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,418
worked in the science world and on

617
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:18,628
projects what what do we need to do to

618
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:21,330
educate the researchers and the doctors

619
00:25:18,628 --> 00:25:22,648
that whole plant is really what they

620
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:24,058
need to be sending their patients to

621
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:26,339
what they really need to be getting to

622
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:29,038
do the research how do we do that as an

623
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:31,378
industry as a patient you need to ask

624
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,089
your doctor and make them feel like

625
00:25:31,378 --> 00:25:36,118
idiots when they don't know anything

626
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:39,808
about this plant because whether they

627
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:41,819
like it or not it's coming and what I'm

628
00:25:39,808 --> 00:25:45,678
trying to do is reach out to my

629
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:50,609
colleagues I you know speak weakly to

630
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:54,090
neural neurology neurology teams you

631
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:57,418
know former athletes other doctors

632
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:59,519
cardiologists oncologists and you know

633
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:01,669
there's just a lot of patients and

634
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,700
parents that come to me that are just

635
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:07,590
desperate for help and for knowledge and

636
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,240
ultimately you know when when I decided

637
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:11,519
to become a doctor

638
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,660
to have proper training and credibility

639
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:18,629
to help people and I think as as doctors

640
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:21,480
we owe that to the people to have

641
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:24,800
knowledge on this on this plant but

642
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:27,779
there's not any proper educational

643
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,669
courses set up and and doctors are like

644
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:32,039
oh hey this isn't federally regulated I

645
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:34,800
don't I'm not gonna you know vouch for

646
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:36,480
it or I don't know anything about it but

647
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,240
when someone like me steps in the room

648
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,480
and educates them on it you know their

649
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:45,269
views change and so you know I think as

650
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,610
a patient what you can do is ask your

651
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:50,670
doctor about it be forward take a stand

652
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:52,169
for your for your own health and you

653
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,970
know and if you have any kind of power

654
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:56,820
whether you're a lawyer or whatever you

655
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:59,190
are you know take take a stand and and

656
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:00,929
and push those that you know have

657
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,990
credibility in this industry that can

658
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:05,789
get research done to do that I mean you

659
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,160
have to be a voice and that's really all

660
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:11,129
we can do we can we can form groups all

661
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,500
day advocate groups but unless we really

662
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,660
like you know advocate for the research

663
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,329
and advocate for the education and and

664
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,519
you know it's not about telling your

665
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:22,199
doctors hey prescribe whole plant it's

666
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:24,210
about telling your doctors look every

667
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,090
person is different we need to treat

668
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,380
each individual as an individual patient

669
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:30,029
that's what we're doing in the medical

670
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,540
industry it's called precision medicine

671
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:35,759
or personalized customized treatment we

672
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:37,379
need to be just implementing cannabis in

673
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,690
there the same way we implement any

674
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,540
other medication because we have amazing

675
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,370
modern technology we have amazing plant

676
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:46,139
resources and we need to be able to put

677
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:49,439
that together and our problem right now

678
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,820
is we're not bridging that gap how do

679
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,320
you make a prescription of something

680
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:54,329
that's not federally like so here in the

681
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,950
United States recommendations so you

682
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:58,079
can't like actually classify this in the

683
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,490
same way but for the weak those rules

684
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,409
are like what we can do like as a

685
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,180
business and operator a regulator or a

686
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,440
patient like there's this little thing

687
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,600
called like the American herbal

688
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,039
pharmacopoeia like kind of an old thing

689
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:10,649
that talks about like pharmaceutical

690
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:13,170
medicine derived from plants Germany is

691
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:14,580
what illuminated my understanding of

692
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:19,050
when I had to import I normally would do

693
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:21,009
GAAP GMP like GDP and then they're like

694
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:22,569
no you need like GAC PMI

695
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:24,309
like good agricultural collection

696
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:26,369
practices so even though that cannabis

697
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:28,690
is doing like agricultural production

698
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:30,250
like it's for how you would like dig

699
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,140
roots in the forest and preserve those

700
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,519
and process those or wild flowers for

701
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,230
like let's say saffron or so like

702
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,539
anything like that so it's a new type of

703
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,860
standard that's like international

704
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:40,629
anyone like since we're already sketchy

705
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:42,609
it's like any business like followed

706
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,830
normal business rules so like American

707
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:46,389
herbal pharmacopoeia G AP type good

708
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:48,669
agricultural practices good agricultural

709
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,020
collection practices GMP for like your

710
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,060
oils and certifications and like

711
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:55,359
manufacturing formulations compounding

712
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:57,429
but even in your country like for 3,300

713
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,319
US a year or K a year you could have

714
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:01,930
your point two point five two point five

715
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:04,179
from some skunk number-3 derived you

716
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:05,740
know in the UK but then like that's for

717
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,090
two point five and two point five and

718
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,890
then like those sorts of companies like

719
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:10,419
when we're getting like the access to

720
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,310
the doctors and that's true prescription

721
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,900
side but then like their stocks almost

722
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:15,519
seven hundred fifty million dollars

723
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,410
right now for one product for like one

724
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,910
small condition like that's where you

725
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:21,220
get the access but seven years of those

726
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,600
trials like titration like doing this

727
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,059
correctly like that's the hard part

728
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:26,559
because what people know of the CBD

729
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:29,230
industry now especially the medical

730
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,240
industry they see like these great case

731
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,559
studies but then it's like well like the

732
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,150
studies aren't large enough a lot of

733
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,399
this isn't it like anecdotal it's like

734
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:38,380
not clinical science we're finding we've

735
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,820
got some great medical representatives

736
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,320
here that I mean some of the warriors

737
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:43,480
out there I mean that one over there

738
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:44,889
it's like incredible to see what they've

739
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,279
done or just like to mention miss Yulan

740
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:50,140
but now with what we can do with this we

741
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:51,160
have to like have the business legal

742
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,840
side that's correct with the

743
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,759
pharmaceutical side and like realize

744
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:56,319
like what you said originally with the

745
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,900
medical card that's just a fucking

746
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,819
Costco membership anymore I mean you're

747
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,110
not paying the out don't use excise tax

748
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:03,819
you can maybe grow a few more plants

749
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:05,589
it's like if you buy at least an ounce a

750
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:07,240
year it makes sense to still pay your

751
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:09,339
doctor but then most doctors you're like

752
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,990
go talk to your doctor think about like

753
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:12,819
dr. feelgood done on Venice Beach or

754
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,829
it's like oh my medical patient might my

755
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:16,389
wrist hurts ands like many of those

756
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:18,819
doctors have no idea that have actually

757
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,110
made the initial recommendations like

758
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:22,450
canna care Docs there's a few that can

759
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:26,649
help but it's like which doctors do

760
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:28,120
we're educate because after you know

761
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,710
hearing from Chelsea and and

762
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:32,808
understanding that you know as a

763
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:37,278
medicine it really is better to have

764
00:30:32,808 --> 00:30:40,220
a 1 to 12 or a 1 to 20 you know with THC

765
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,690
blended from the flower plant in the

766
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:46,460
industry and from the clients that you

767
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:48,830
work with is there a want to enter into

768
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:52,548
the the legal market in the commercial

769
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:54,888
market of cannabis to provide CBD in the

770
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:56,990
legal markets or is it that no the path

771
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:58,668
of hemp without having a deal with

772
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,798
licensing and is a much better

773
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:02,419
investment in it it makes so much more

774
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:05,028
money that that's just where the money

775
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:07,309
is gonna stay until we have maybe a full

776
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:09,048
all national legalization but is there

777
00:31:07,308 --> 00:31:12,019
any interest that you're hearing of

778
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:14,089
people that want to get into whole plant

779
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:15,919
CBD extraction instead of the hip

780
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:17,178
derived like huge I mean there's

781
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,740
probably a hundred and fifty million

782
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:20,028
right now of capex investments I know

783
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,288
about in the United States with like

784
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:23,179
West Virginia projects are large

785
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:25,190
extraction Kentucky like the wildest

786
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:27,019
wild market it's really like the best

787
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,869
laws for legality Kentucky's like fuck

788
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:31,278
you is what their lives pretty much it's

789
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:32,658
like it's legal to export it out of

790
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:34,429
state lines and it's like well but once

791
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:36,320
you're out of Kentucky your rule doesn't

792
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:38,899
really apply anymore

793
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:41,148
I am absolutely as an individual as

794
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:42,739
entities and people are but there's too

795
00:31:41,148 --> 00:31:44,959
much risk with a lot of the u.s. CBD

796
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,669
companies right now just like the state

797
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,590
to state the legal ambiguity but I think

798
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:51,470
of like one thing I'm looking at deeply

799
00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:53,480
right now is like fibromyalgia 22

800
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:54,950
billion-dollar market share last year

801
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,079
and when we think about cannabis derived

802
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:59,119
products taking up to 10% of that market

803
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:01,099
by 2027 projected to be about twenty

804
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:02,720
eight billion ten percent or twenty

805
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:03,859
eight billion that's 2.8 billion there's

806
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,649
five companies doing clinical trials

807
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:07,849
right now one sucks ones mildly sucking

808
00:32:06,648 --> 00:32:09,589
ones doing great and the other two are

809
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:11,599
like uh they haven't released yet like

810
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:13,099
of course those initial investments like

811
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,808
to capture that much market share to

812
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:16,158
help that many patients great the

813
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:18,138
problem is the companies doing it are

814
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,909
like not saying GW Pharma good bad ugly

815
00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:23,449
I don't like to trash companies unless

816
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:24,830
it still ray but I'm just kidding

817
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,840
there's a lot of others worth trashing

818
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:28,908
but that company for that medicine

819
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:31,849
derive from a not even very good variety

820
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:33,169
like Apotex Sativex like the cost of

821
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,668
like pharmaceutical companies getting

822
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:36,230
that that can afford the research like

823
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:37,820
I'm just scared that the ones that are

824
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:40,009
interested in investing into the real of

825
00:32:37,819 --> 00:32:41,750
this industry are going to be the ones

826
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:44,690
that control it and then don't allow

827
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,990
safe like affordable access other than

828
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,490
just like a different tax rate

829
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:49,500
like I have a medical card I mean

830
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,150
Colorado medical cards peak like 130 ish

831
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,980
K and like now they're like around

832
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,320
80,000 just for a few more plants and

833
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,849
less taxes California is the same way

834
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:58,919
but like we have to remember the medical

835
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:00,719
basis of this but there's a lot of

836
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,759
investment interests but not in like hey

837
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,289
I make these products in CBD and I used

838
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,490
to do THC and I couldn't get legal on

839
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:07,529
that and now I have all the stuff and I

840
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:10,109
extract and I blow stuff and now we do

841
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:11,490
it from hamper low varieties it's all

842
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:13,558
gonna be changing over the next two to

843
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,849
five years based on too many shitheads

844
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,019
fucking it up right now for the people

845
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:18,480
who actually need it from a business

846
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:20,400
investment standpoint you are saying

847
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,710
then that yeah we're gonna see a shift

848
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,150
in the investment to want to get into

849
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,120
the legal commercial world with CBD

850
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:29,460
because I think that you know that that

851
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,199
it's causing a disservice major mainly

852
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,410
to the consumer and especially at a time

853
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,960
when so many people are embracing CBD as

854
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:39,058
a whole and there's places to get it and

855
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,370
we refer to it almost commonly as snake

856
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:43,220
oil because you're you're sending a

857
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:45,899
patient or a doctor is sending a patient

858
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,360
to an open consumer market to buy

859
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:52,830
something over-the-counter that isn't

860
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:54,750
truly what it is and you know what can

861
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:56,730
we do and I think from a patient's

862
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:59,700
perspective Chelsea's story really

863
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:02,849
shines light to it and what we need to

864
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,789
educate the consumer and you know

865
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:07,709
Annabelle talked about the you know the

866
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:10,739
doctors and the researchers but what is

867
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:12,480
it that we all do just guys as a company

868
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:14,638
that's producing hip derived CBD but

869
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,260
knowing from the patient that clearly

870
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,419
it's better from the whole plan how do

871
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,490
we get that through to the consumer and

872
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:23,339
what can you do from your point of view

873
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:26,668
I think before we start talking about

874
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:29,010
what to invest in we should talk about

875
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:32,449
the fact that most of us don't invest in

876
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:35,129
ourselves enough and the issue is that

877
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:37,108
we can say talk to doctors but doctors

878
00:34:35,128 --> 00:34:39,358
aren't taught about the endocannabinoid

879
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:41,069
system in medical school so the doctors

880
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,460
actually aren't the experts in the room

881
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:46,830
and in my eyes functional medicine isn't

882
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,079
enough until people learn to listen to

883
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:51,659
their bodies before they listen to the

884
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:54,599
advice of doctors I got started in this

885
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:57,329
space because I met this girl named tani

886
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,199
Shaw who was diagnosed with stage 4

887
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:01,088
liver cancer and given six months

888
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,039
live and she shook her head at her

889
00:35:01,088 --> 00:35:04,900
doctor and she said no you won't tell me

890
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:07,900
how much longer I have to live and she

891
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,430
found cannabis oil early and kept

892
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,608
herself alive for almost four years

893
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:14,649
until she was ready to go and so in my

894
00:35:12,608 --> 00:35:17,108
mind the conversation starts from within

895
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,789
and it's actually empowering people at a

896
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:20,759
young age to actually listen to

897
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:23,019
themselves listen to not just their

898
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,000
intuition but their bodies and

899
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:26,820
understand when something's off and

900
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,679
actually work towards prevention because

901
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,480
I'm a patient we're all patients if we

902
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:33,819
believe in the plan and if we use it and

903
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,500
I think there's a major blurred line

904
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,210
between what it means to be a social

905
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,679
user and a medical user when we could

906
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,750
all probably acknowledge that the plant

907
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:43,509
makes us feel good which is an extension

908
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:45,820
of health and happiness so in my mind

909
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:47,859
it's just all the rest is noise even

910
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:50,109
sometimes what the doctors are saying is

911
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:52,539
noise and what we should be teaching

912
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:55,690
people from an early age is to listen to

913
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:58,829
our bodies trust plants over pills at

914
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:01,059
least initially do have enough faith in

915
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:02,980
nature to do a little bit of

916
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:06,549
experimentation realize that you are

917
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:09,608
your own guinea pig and best advocate so

918
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:11,410
it might take a few high nights you know

919
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:13,630
pass out go to sleep eat some snacks

920
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:14,949
it's not the end of the world if you see

921
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:18,670
what's happening in the pharmaceutical

922
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:21,129
side what doctors are giving you before

923
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:23,800
they trust the plant and the things that

924
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,390
patients experienced initially upfront

925
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,089
when they're diagnosed with cancer any

926
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:30,818
of these horrendous illnesses it's it's

927
00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:33,789
just it's crazy and I think that we all

928
00:36:30,818 --> 00:36:35,739
have an innate responsibility to use our

929
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:38,349
personal knowledge and experience with

930
00:36:35,739 --> 00:36:40,719
the plant to teach people to listen to

931
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:42,579
their bodies sometimes you have to trust

932
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,699
something beyond medical advice and

933
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:48,099
Trust the mysticism of the world and

934
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:52,659
just keep trying because that's what

935
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:55,710
we're all here for yeah just to add to

936
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:58,420
that I think sometimes we underestimate

937
00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:00,550
you know the power of our own experience

938
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:03,220
as you were saying and I think you know

939
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:05,650
it's very easy to be intimidated by you

940
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:06,789
know our physicians and perhaps for

941
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,440
someone like myself that comes from a

942
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:11,009
patient's down but okay so I don't speak

943
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,380
that language and so you know when I was

944
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:16,230
I must have been in my teens when I went

945
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,980
to my urologist and I said I've seen

946
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,389
this video

947
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,679
it was the Charlotte's Web videos that

948
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:21,989
was the first time I ever you know

949
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:26,129
learnt anything about medicinal cannabis

950
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:27,779
and he laughed in my face and had I have

951
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:31,050
listened to my doctor I wouldn't be

952
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,820
sitting here two years seizure free off

953
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,470
pharmaceutical medicine with no side

954
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,420
effects I was suicidal on that medicine

955
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:38,579
that medicine ruined my life and I'm off

956
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,650
it it has changed my life and I think

957
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:42,000
when I say we underestimate that you

958
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,650
know we have to believe in ourselves as

959
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,170
jess was saying and I think you know

960
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,180
sorry to bring back to the UK but again

961
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:50,550
looking you know I'm sure many of you

962
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:52,230
have read about this little boy called

963
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:53,430
Billy Caldwell and his mother Charlotte

964
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,460
we'd been following them for the

965
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:58,980
documentary and she is honestly you know

966
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,199
one of the most incredible activists out

967
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,119
there right now because she said no to

968
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,460
her doctor and she said no to conforming

969
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,929
and the government you know they tried

970
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,550
to take the medicine away and she said I

971
00:38:06,929 --> 00:38:10,139
have three weeks of medicine left this

972
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:12,650
is my son's medicine this stops his

973
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:14,849
seizures they you know they refused she

974
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:16,980
challenged the government she got on a

975
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:18,929
plane to Canada and she brought his

976
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,909
medicine back through he threw the

977
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:22,469
medicine was then seized and has someone

978
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:24,750
into hospital and it was because of her

979
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:25,889
bravery and her fight and she didn't

980
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,329
give up and she said you know what I

981
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:28,679
know that I could get this medicine and

982
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:30,449
keep my mouth shut just like the other

983
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:32,609
little boy Alfie ding be in the UK did

984
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:34,169
but she said I am doing this for all the

985
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,730
other little boys and little girls and

986
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:38,190
other patients in the United Kingdom and

987
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,530
because of her bravery the you that the

988
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:43,230
the Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced

989
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:45,269
that the UK is rescheduling cannabis now

990
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,619
that is humungous obviously because it

991
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:48,929
moves from a schedule 1 to schedule 2

992
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:51,630
and that you know is the beginning but

993
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:53,069
then you have the issue of so now you

994
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,360
know they've announces rescheduling

995
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,950
people think they have access to this

996
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,090
medicine people are applying for licence

997
00:38:55,949 --> 00:38:59,219
they're getting denied because the

998
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:01,110
doctors have that they have had no

999
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:03,149
education a doctor isn't going to

1000
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:05,340
suddenly go from knowing nothing about

1001
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,360
medicinal cannabis to prescribing it as

1002
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,760
you said they don't know about the

1003
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:11,039
endocannabinoid system so I think it is

1004
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,360
our job as as patients as people in this

1005
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:13,619
industry first of all to remember I

1006
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,329
think there's so much excitement around

1007
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:16,739
you know investment and the business

1008
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:18,960
side but to remember that we are here

1009
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:20,789
because of the patients and this is you

1010
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,059
know a movement that needs to be led by

1011
00:39:20,789 --> 00:39:26,719
by the patient's by science you know not

1012
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:26,719
by Paula

1013
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:34,860
and so I think you know if we can go to

1014
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:36,750
our doctors and say how we feel you know

1015
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:39,570
if I can go to my urologist and say I

1016
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:42,000
feel different using a one-to-one or a

1017
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:43,980
CD from whole plant versus CBD Eisler if

1018
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,039
I can present the you know some research

1019
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,449
if I can look at other you know even

1020
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,239
anecdotal stories I think that does

1021
00:39:48,449 --> 00:39:52,919
carry weight because we see these when

1022
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:55,019
you tug on the heartstrings that's what

1023
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,869
sparks change and and you see that now

1024
00:39:55,019 --> 00:40:00,360
happening in the UK so I think we have

1025
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:02,940
to believe in ourselves and use our

1026
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:06,450
experience to to you know spearhead this

1027
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:08,970
this this change in this movement I also

1028
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:11,339
quickly want to call out Jeff Chen who's

1029
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:14,730
actually creating educational materials

1030
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:16,530
that will be distributed among medical

1031
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:19,500
schools and so there are a lot of young

1032
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:22,380
researchers who were super hungry and

1033
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,269
committed to not just the patients but

1034
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,869
to training doctors and medical

1035
00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:29,550
professionals that's happening at UCLA

1036
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:31,679
one of my questions like with that night

1037
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,700
I agree with all that you just said

1038
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,029
there

1039
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:37,859
but like who funds medical research like

1040
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:40,200
companies and this is really sad like as

1041
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,610
a patient I the Dreaming side of this

1042
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,869
industry I've loved it and like I come

1043
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:44,519
from it but then I saw it all like

1044
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:46,529
leading to crap and never getting done

1045
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:50,429
and then like all the concepts not

1046
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:51,990
happening so it's like patients equal

1047
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:53,759
clients clients equal revenue revenue

1048
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:55,889
equals business without serving my

1049
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,120
patients asked like actual clients I

1050
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:58,589
don't have a business I don't have

1051
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,929
qualifying conditions in a market or a

1052
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,980
state that can buy my product if they're

1053
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:04,109
just doing like an absolute epidemic

1054
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:05,130
Ceti and they didn't do pain like which

1055
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,420
they should have made because their

1056
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,829
market share would been huge but it

1057
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,139
would have been too much to take on at

1058
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:11,309
one time but it's like we need the

1059
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:12,929
businesses to actually serve the

1060
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:14,699
patients but we can't do this without

1061
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:16,169
the businesses because the business is

1062
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:18,149
doing it we're so shitty and

1063
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:20,309
misrepresenting this and not scaling

1064
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:23,099
like I'm not a I'm a biologist farm dude

1065
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:25,949
like this is a little new over the last

1066
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:27,329
decade here but without robust good

1067
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:29,189
quality businesses that can raise

1068
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:31,440
capital and have investors interested in

1069
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:33,179
a product like that don't show crazy

1070
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,590
market risk or like the team's insane

1071
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:35,849
like the Stanley Brothers to see what

1072
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,420
they've done over the years like from

1073
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:38,009
Colorado

1074
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,389
the roots and now it's like it's

1075
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,670
impressive but like that's one out of a

1076
00:41:39,389 --> 00:41:43,170
thousand type stories but then they're

1077
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,780
gonna turn into a business now that's

1078
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:47,220
gonna make medicine for how many some of

1079
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,390
the past violations and lawsuits might

1080
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:50,669
come back and hurt them for like pass

1081
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:52,440
violations but doesn't be long term

1082
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,030
things but it's the businesses that can

1083
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,679
do it but we need the patients to ask

1084
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,150
and like also like vote with your

1085
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,399
dollars when it comes to these products

1086
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,360
like if you don't buy crappy products

1087
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,670
from companies they go out of business

1088
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,440
so like knowing I'd love to see like

1089
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,240
patient advocacy groups that like

1090
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,650
actually went with testing and said like

1091
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:09,389
these are actually the products that are

1092
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,829
not crap that we know of today and these

1093
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:12,059
are the ones that are total crap to stay

1094
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:14,610
away from like I would love to see a

1095
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:16,619
source for that too for patients I think

1096
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:18,150
you know I completely agree I think that

1097
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:20,519
that's absolutely what we need but I

1098
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,470
think that what that is is essentially

1099
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:25,469
your commercial licensed cannabis

1100
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:27,299
producers and I think it's there's a

1101
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:30,059
very clear division between your

1102
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:33,480
commercial cannabis producers and hemp

1103
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:34,769
derived CBD and I think that that's you

1104
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,269
know we're hearing that from patients I

1105
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:38,519
hear from patients every day it's a

1106
00:42:36,269 --> 00:42:40,650
whole wellness that have gone down the

1107
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:43,050
road of kind of getting him to Rive CBD

1108
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:45,840
from typical stores and and then they

1109
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:47,730
come back to you know a twenty to one or

1110
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,410
even a one to one whatever it is and

1111
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:52,500
there's a clear difference and as

1112
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:54,779
Chelsea told us so how you know one of

1113
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,150
the things is how do we after this huge

1114
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:00,390
investment and all of this is going into

1115
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:02,039
him derive CBD is there talk about what

1116
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:05,339
is the transition which there's a very

1117
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:06,840
great and natural transition for all the

1118
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,190
hemp fields that are being planted which

1119
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,110
is a great thing and the farm bill

1120
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,940
that's going to come is that discussion

1121
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:15,510
starting to happen the transition into

1122
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:17,309
textiles and do industrial hemp so that

1123
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:19,740
these investments can transition and not

1124
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:21,659
be out of total loss when this is

1125
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:23,369
realized by the consumer I mean like

1126
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:25,529
four years ago that big hemp project I

1127
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:27,659
was like taping disks like seating discs

1128
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:29,070
to like was a vegetable cedar like

1129
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:30,719
vacuum cedar to plant these things in

1130
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:32,600
rows because like no hemp discs were in

1131
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:34,980
the United States been illegal forever

1132
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:36,449
and I realized that I'm like wow the

1133
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,980
u.s. hemp industry that everyone's gonna

1134
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:39,659
talk about in loves which will be huge

1135
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,369
and robust someday was still at that

1136
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:43,529
point a quarter billion dollars shy of

1137
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:45,150
initial infrastructure four D quarters

1138
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,740
writers and then I kept seeing all these

1139
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,519
producers grow huge hemp fields in

1140
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:49,539
Colorado and

1141
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,099
material and like what do we do with

1142
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:51,730
this now how do we drive ass like oh

1143
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:53,740
shit

1144
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:56,050
and then like trying to import it and

1145
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:57,639
move it the shift I really see though

1146
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:00,130
that already has been discussed though

1147
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:02,079
with this sort once it's a legalization

1148
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,369
as a question of when especially like

1149
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,739
with our farm bill with certain pieces

1150
00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:07,090
but the hemp side will get huge but we

1151
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:10,299
need copious amounts of investment

1152
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:13,690
because most of like the Canadian most

1153
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:16,090
of the Chinese most of like those like

1154
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:17,559
for the products it's just like we can

1155
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,269
do this this is like a seven eight

1156
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:20,320
hundred million dollar annual industry

1157
00:44:19,269 --> 00:44:22,239
now but just think we're all wearing

1158
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,920
clothes we all need protein sources we

1159
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:25,899
all need like it's gonna be enormous but

1160
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,900
I like using the cannabis side to fund

1161
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:30,970
that side but for hemp derived CBD or

1162
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,889
like cannabis derived I mean based on

1163
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:34,449
Colombian law right now I work deeply

1164
00:44:32,889 --> 00:44:36,639
international being able to export bulk

1165
00:44:34,449 --> 00:44:38,019
oils and like on the equator for it

1166
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:39,250
doesn't matter cost to production in the

1167
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:41,440
United States like most of the

1168
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,300
cannabinoids from like hemp derived or

1169
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,530
like cannabis derived once federally

1170
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,930
legal in these things are happening will

1171
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:48,790
be coming from Colombia even though we

1172
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:50,230
can grow great hemp here and in Canada

1173
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:52,389
but like it's just low cost production

1174
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:53,769
cannabis varieties it's about cost of

1175
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:55,480
production when it comes to business if

1176
00:44:53,769 --> 00:44:58,480
it's allowed for the import side well

1177
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,309
but you know Canada just recently Toure

1178
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,980
will be providing cannabis for research

1179
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:04,989
here in the US and they will be bringing

1180
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,449
what night as night as cannabis wasn't

1181
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:10,000
quality enough well it's ridiculous I

1182
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:11,980
completely agree but CBD whole plant

1183
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,539
derived cannabis oils are gonna be

1184
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:16,000
available on the global market from

1185
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:17,529
Canada so yeah aren't currently from

1186
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,960
actually eleven other countries there's

1187
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:22,359
27 countries that allow import 21

1188
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:25,449
actually doing it actively right so the

1189
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:27,880
the idea not just from Canada the the

1190
00:45:25,449 --> 00:45:30,039
idea of hemp derived CBD I mean don't

1191
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,720
you think that that further shows the

1192
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:33,699
consumer when there's availability of

1193
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:35,259
whole plant from legal countries we're

1194
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:37,239
not one of those legal countries yet but

1195
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,099
I think that just furthers that point

1196
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:41,858
you know and and so I guess my point

1197
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:43,450
here is how do we get those investment

1198
00:45:41,858 --> 00:45:45,250
diverted to where they should be which

1199
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:47,319
is textiles and not medicine

1200
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:51,760
the industrial didn't the industrial

1201
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:54,880
growing hemp is what I I know that in

1202
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,859
the state of Kentucky and Tennessee they

1203
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,858
are putting millions hundreds of

1204
00:45:56,858 --> 00:46:01,808
millions of dollars into it's like

1205
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:04,989
I don't know anything about tractors but

1206
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:07,480
it's a double-cut technology where

1207
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:09,999
they're able to at harvest time they're

1208
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:13,838
able to get the flour for the oils and

1209
00:46:09,998 --> 00:46:16,328
the resin but also get the stock as well

1210
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:16,748
so that you can utilize the whole plant

1211
00:46:16,329 --> 00:46:20,890
I mean

1212
00:46:16,748 --> 00:46:24,578
hanpan is over 2,500 I think more uses

1213
00:46:20,889 --> 00:46:27,879
and so to look at it as just medicine or

1214
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:29,890
to grow it only for the medicine part or

1215
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,028
only for the textiles part is wrong I

1216
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:32,710
mean if we're gonna put a ton of money

1217
00:46:31,028 --> 00:46:34,599
into this we should try to definitely

1218
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:36,999
use the whole plant so I know that in

1219
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:40,028
Tennessee in Kentucky there's a lot of

1220
00:46:36,998 --> 00:46:41,798
money a lot of big corporations going

1221
00:46:40,028 --> 00:46:43,989
behind that but I don't know the

1222
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:47,108
business side of the rest of the country

1223
00:46:43,989 --> 00:46:48,639
1 to 2 million is like a combine and

1224
00:46:47,108 --> 00:46:50,108
then you look at like the 10 million

1225
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,210
investment for a d quarter right or

1226
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:54,190
they're like comes amazing but like to

1227
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,269
do industrial manufacturing biggest ham

1228
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:56,829
stuff in the United States will be

1229
00:46:55,268 --> 00:46:59,348
mostly like where you can grow hemp

1230
00:46:56,829 --> 00:47:01,180
based on like 25 to 35 inches of annual

1231
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:02,710
precip daytime high nighttime low you

1232
00:47:01,179 --> 00:47:05,018
look at like the Iowa is the Minnesota's

1233
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:06,639
Wisconsin's but like those sorts of

1234
00:47:05,018 --> 00:47:08,889
instruments that the problem is we

1235
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,389
Tennessee I've clients in Tennessee hem

1236
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:12,308
farmers so then like even last year

1237
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:14,528
thing Oh hams really high in CBD that's

1238
00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:16,269
bullshit I've grown like varieties so

1239
00:47:14,528 --> 00:47:18,009
we're like point zero two percent CBD

1240
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:19,988
ting like wow that five acres isn't even

1241
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:21,338
worth doing anything with and then if

1242
00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:22,809
it's a cannabis side like we actually

1243
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,099
have to like grind all the stocks and

1244
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:26,200
like it's amazing the amount of like

1245
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:27,430
biomass we have to destroy based on

1246
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:29,679
either being medical cannabis or

1247
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:31,480
homicide and if it's really high like

1248
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,159
potency the genetics like then it's

1249
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,659
worth extracting but I can't even touch

1250
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:37,989
four CBD extractions something less than

1251
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:39,308
3% commercially to make it viable at

1252
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:40,778
least on industrial scale but you're

1253
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:42,579
right like those places are gonna grow

1254
00:47:40,778 --> 00:47:44,108
copious amounts most of them just they

1255
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:46,119
don't have anywhere to send it or use it

1256
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:48,278
right now and then it actually dissuades

1257
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:50,170
a lot of farmers to keep planting it

1258
00:47:48,278 --> 00:47:51,579
because like what do you do with it and

1259
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:54,759
then one male plant have you seen a

1260
00:47:51,579 --> 00:47:56,048
15-foot tall male hemp plant like it

1261
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:57,369
changes everything when it comes to

1262
00:47:56,048 --> 00:47:59,199
whole plant extraction because then

1263
00:47:57,369 --> 00:48:00,579
you're no longer on pollen eyes or even

1264
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:03,909
if you're doing feminized your neighbor

1265
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:06,430
10 miles away with his horny boys if I

1266
00:48:03,909 --> 00:48:07,328
can find those virgin girls in it's just

1267
00:48:06,429 --> 00:48:10,719
you can its

1268
00:48:07,329 --> 00:48:11,920
hemp pollen is insane so the states that

1269
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:12,500
allow it all you look at pueblos in

1270
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,750
Colorado

1271
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,940
wouldn't allow male outdoor plants in

1272
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:18,769
the hemp or cannabis industry only like

1273
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,300
outdoor feminized because Sal paste-like

1274
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:21,889
from a revenue standpoint realized to

1275
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,870
like hey if we're trying to do major oil

1276
00:48:21,889 --> 00:48:25,789
extraction in these places for hemp CBD

1277
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:29,869
and others like we can't let the boys

1278
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:32,090
anywhere in the county so so I wanted to

1279
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:34,579
talk to you about the the CBD oil that

1280
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:36,110
you made which I believe he said was in

1281
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,730
Tennessee when you were when you were

1282
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:40,490
doing that so what was the process that

1283
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:41,809
you took and especially if you're

1284
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:44,329
comfortable with talking with you know

1285
00:48:41,809 --> 00:48:46,909
using it with your child and kind of

1286
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:47,509
understanding the effects and and how

1287
00:48:46,909 --> 00:48:52,129
that went

1288
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:55,250
sure so I learned quickly that you know

1289
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:57,230
my focus when I was in school I was in

1290
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,940
medical school first and I learned

1291
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:01,760
quickly that every patient is different

1292
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:03,289
and we're treating you know patient a

1293
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,210
with lung cancer the same way we're

1294
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:07,610
treating patient B with lung cancer and

1295
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:09,470
that's absolutely wrong so then I went

1296
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:11,809
towards a PhD because I wanted to

1297
00:49:09,469 --> 00:49:14,779
understand more about the disease more

1298
00:49:11,809 --> 00:49:17,539
about why we you know formulate

1299
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:19,640
medications the way that we do and you

1300
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:22,190
know that all I think came down and

1301
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:24,379
helped me when it when it when I had a

1302
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:27,679
son who you know was in an emergency

1303
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:29,809
situation so when formulating for him I

1304
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:31,639
started educating myself obviously first

1305
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:34,130
thing was the endocannabinoid system I

1306
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:37,039
didn't know if I wanted to try THC or

1307
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:39,140
CBD or any of that but what I ended up

1308
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:42,440
doing was doing a genetic test on my own

1309
00:49:39,139 --> 00:49:45,109
son and I found out that with him I

1310
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,300
thought that CBD alone as an isolate

1311
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:50,329
would replace his medications now I've

1312
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:52,370
worked with different CBD extracts and

1313
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:54,769
other cannabinoids and you know that

1314
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:57,349
doesn't work for every epilepsy child

1315
00:49:54,769 --> 00:49:59,539
but and I'm gonna say child because you

1316
00:49:57,349 --> 00:50:04,099
know that's what's most dear to me but

1317
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:06,469
for my own son a very potent isolate I

1318
00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:09,259
felt was going to replace the five

1319
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:11,209
medications that he was on and so it was

1320
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:13,910
kind of scientific calculation to be

1321
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:15,679
honest I also looked into the delivery

1322
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:19,789
you know currently we used a lot of

1323
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,799
coconut oils palm oils MCT oils I wanted

1324
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:24,230
something that would potentially have a

1325
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,700
better absorption rate because those

1326
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,119
oils we know they're good for us but

1327
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:27,768
then you have

1328
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:30,829
gestern problems because that is a lot

1329
00:50:27,768 --> 00:50:33,409
of fat and if you think about using fat

1330
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:35,568
as a delivery system once you break it

1331
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:37,489
down how much by a veil of

1332
00:50:35,568 --> 00:50:39,710
bioavailability do you have what's the

1333
00:50:37,489 --> 00:50:43,159
absorption rate where does the CBD go

1334
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:45,710
how much did we metabolize so actually

1335
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:48,920
my patents are not necessarily around

1336
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:50,749
extraction they're around delivery and

1337
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,999
formulation and protocol because another

1338
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:55,578
problem that you have with any products

1339
00:50:52,998 --> 00:50:57,318
like let it be tumeric or whatever you

1340
00:50:55,579 --> 00:51:01,099
want to call it anything in an oil is

1341
00:50:57,318 --> 00:51:03,558
the dispersion rate so is every drop the

1342
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:05,809
same do we have five milligrams in every

1343
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:08,240
single drop and these are things that we

1344
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:09,319
learn you know when when we're when

1345
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:10,818
we're doing clinical trial

1346
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:13,699
certifications we learn how to make

1347
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:15,349
things properly and you know even though

1348
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:17,808
I think it's really important that we

1349
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:20,630
listen to our bodies man that's number

1350
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:23,259
one on the list you know we need to

1351
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:26,088
change the view of doctors from being so

1352
00:51:23,259 --> 00:51:28,248
so stuck to these protocols and to be

1353
00:51:26,088 --> 00:51:30,409
more open-minded and understand that

1354
00:51:28,248 --> 00:51:32,719
every patient is different every patient

1355
00:51:30,409 --> 00:51:34,730
might need different formulations one

1356
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:37,248
might need one one might one might need

1357
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:38,719
twenty two one and you know and a lot of

1358
00:51:37,248 --> 00:51:41,480
it has to do with being in tune with

1359
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:43,909
yourself you know and and doctors need

1360
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,798
to be more more you know more like

1361
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:47,778
somebody to come to and talk to and work

1362
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:50,568
with opposed to all right that's wrong

1363
00:51:47,778 --> 00:51:53,838
with you here you go you know so my

1364
00:51:50,568 --> 00:51:57,108
specific formulation was you know for my

1365
00:51:53,838 --> 00:52:00,108
son and it worked very well for him and

1366
00:51:57,108 --> 00:52:03,980
I'm seeing it work for a lot of people I

1367
00:52:00,108 --> 00:52:06,199
feel like CBD is obviously better with

1368
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,759
other parts of the plant we haven't

1369
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:10,038
defined those other parts of the plant

1370
00:52:07,759 --> 00:52:11,690
so it's tricky it's kind of a risk it's

1371
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:14,720
a good risk because cannabis doesn't

1372
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:17,480
hurt us but you know just my scientific

1373
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:21,828
mind I really have been an advocate for

1374
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:23,599
CBD alone THC alone mixing the two and

1375
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:25,400
doing research to figure out what the

1376
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,640
what the other benefits of the other

1377
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:32,599
molecules are and and so that's kind of

1378
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:34,338
been the focus I really want to mention

1379
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:36,710
as well and working with the president

1380
00:52:34,338 --> 00:52:39,769
of the American pharmacy Association to

1381
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:41,630
make an accredited continuing education

1382
00:52:39,769 --> 00:52:44,570
course for both pharmacists and doctors

1383
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:46,789
I think it's really important that you

1384
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:49,039
know we don't be oh say no to your

1385
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:51,500
doctor don't even go to a doctor but to

1386
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:54,829
to stand up for for medicine in a way

1387
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:56,659
that to help change the way that that we

1388
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:58,460
we do medicine because medicine is

1389
00:52:56,659 --> 00:53:00,349
important and it's never going away and

1390
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:02,269
biopharm is important and it's worth

1391
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:05,420
billions of dollars and it's never going

1392
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:08,659
away so unless we educate ourselves and

1393
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:10,190
and you know be better patients instead

1394
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:14,779
of fighting let's find a way to work

1395
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:16,490
together some really impressed with the

1396
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,600
knowledge you have as far as what's

1397
00:53:16,489 --> 00:53:18,829
happening from a scientific level

1398
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,170
especially around cannabinoid based

1399
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:23,389
research but my question specifically we

1400
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:24,559
talked a lot about the plant today from

1401
00:53:23,389 --> 00:53:26,000
the standpoint of you know having worked

1402
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,880
in the company that worked on the up

1403
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,710
Iowa synthetic and bio catalytic side of

1404
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:34,309
this Annabelle specifically for you as a

1405
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:36,079
medical background is you know where do

1406
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:37,190
you see the the industry going when I

1407
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,779
think about the bifurcation in the

1408
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:40,190
industry between the scientific side the

1409
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,420
medical side away from like the adult

1410
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:43,280
use recreational even like the

1411
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:46,700
nutraceutical side is where do you see

1412
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:49,519
the the pharmacy industry going with bio

1413
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:50,960
synthetic bio catalytics and synthetic

1414
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:53,630
biology in general to produce

1415
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,619
cannabinoids that are you know identical

1416
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:57,440
and actually produced through a

1417
00:53:54,619 --> 00:54:02,630
biological enzymatic process rather than

1418
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:05,690
just through a plant extraction you know

1419
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:07,640
we we we've made a lot of money on the

1420
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:12,200
pharmaceutical side with synthetics and

1421
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:15,440
and making things I call it plastic and

1422
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:18,679
I really don't think and what from what

1423
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,940
I see I really don't think that most of

1424
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:22,849
the pharmaceutical industry is

1425
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:26,599
interested in setting up greenhouses and

1426
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:30,650
doing it the plant way to be honest and

1427
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:32,449
so you know that's the fight other parts

1428
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:34,220
of the world are doing it right Israel's

1429
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:38,539
doing it right Canada is about to do or

1430
00:54:34,219 --> 00:54:40,279
right Germany but on this side I've you

1431
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:42,800
know from what I've seen in what I know

1432
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,470
I cannot see the pharmaceutical side

1433
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,810
thinking that they'll make enough money

1434
00:54:44,469 --> 00:54:50,119
for setting up greenhouses and big

1435
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:52,279
extractors and be because imagine how

1436
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:53,239
big these extraction units have to be to

1437
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,420
push out a million

1438
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:59,949
a month so no I mean if we're gonna

1439
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:59,950
fight anything it's going to be that I

1440
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:04,569
do you think

1441
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:30,250
synthetics are not the same as a whole

1442
00:55:09,969 --> 00:55:31,389
plan you see the problems with that like

1443
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:33,010
when you see the side effects of the

1444
00:55:31,389 --> 00:55:34,089
synthetic side but then also like some

1445
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:36,070
of the research we've been looking at

1446
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:37,480
from like also like the insulin side of

1447
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:39,760
do like they're looking at it from all

1448
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,289
angles to make it easier but I think

1449
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,990
we'll also find like there's something

1450
00:55:41,289 --> 00:55:45,309
about biomimicry in the cost that the

1451
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:48,309
plant will still I think be involved

1452
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:50,860
deeply okay this is our last question I

1453
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:52,960
had a medical situation eight months ago

1454
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:54,940
I had brain surgery because I found that

1455
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,820
I had a brain tumor and through the

1456
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,800
medication that they did give me part of

1457
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,870
it from a seizure standpoint I agree

1458
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,920
with you I don't like the side effects

1459
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:04,719
and everything that I'm going through

1460
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,789
that the doctor had prescribed and I did

1461
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,559
talk to the doctor about CBD and he

1462
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:11,590
wasn't quite giving enough information

1463
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:14,289
so what type of research I should do to

1464
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:16,780
determine what type of CBD I should take

1465
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:18,519
in regards to the prescribed medicine

1466
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:22,290
that I'm taking from the hospital or

1467
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:22,289
from the doctor that's a hard question

1468
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:28,870
CBD is gonna be safe for you with a lot

1469
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:31,870
of research that I've been reading there

1470
00:56:28,869 --> 00:56:35,529
are good there's solid research showing

1471
00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:38,019
that THC is very beneficial for the

1472
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:42,040
brain mix with CBD and the reason being

1473
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:44,380
is that THC works a lot like the opioids

1474
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:47,289
and a lot like these psychoactive drugs

1475
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:50,769
that we have in a way that it binds

1476
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:52,659
directly to neurons so when you've had

1477
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:54,280
any kind of brain damage or injury

1478
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:56,500
you've lost a lot of neuro protective

1479
00:56:54,280 --> 00:57:00,130
'ti which means you've lost a lot of

1480
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:02,320
your simple signaling senses CBD is more

1481
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:04,630
of a catalyst or an activator and that's

1482
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:07,480
why we don't get high when we take CBD

1483
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:09,880
and together you know not only do we

1484
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:12,219
reduce the psycho activity of THC but

1485
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,530
it's almost like it's almost like you're

1486
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:16,719
you're putting a stop to something and

1487
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:19,630
holding it in place so that CBD can come

1488
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:23,109
and react and work on the

1489
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:29,500
if that makes sense I always tell people

1490
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:31,720
you know to to try a CBD with THC and

1491
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:34,570
then you got to kind of just if you

1492
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:36,639
don't have proper you know somebody

1493
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:40,750
proper to talk to you or a doctor to go

1494
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:44,019
to I mean you can take my number but you

1495
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:46,570
know it really this industry's we're in

1496
00:57:44,019 --> 00:57:49,480
a growing position to where we can't

1497
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:52,360
look at you and say take CBD one-to-one

1498
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:54,579
take CBD one to two I mean she

1499
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,890
discovered what works for her that may

1500
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:58,420
not work for you what works for my son

1501
00:57:56,889 --> 00:58:02,259
doesn't work for several other children

1502
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:04,019
and so I think the best thing about you

1503
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:07,870
being here is that you're here and that

1504
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:09,780
you're willing to utilize cannabis and

1505
00:58:07,869 --> 00:58:11,920
try what's going to be best for you

1506
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:15,460
whether it is to wean off the

1507
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:17,800
medications or to work with them you

1508
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:20,019
know you're in a good place so yeah you

1509
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:23,260
can get my number after the show also

1510
00:58:20,019 --> 00:58:25,059
just to add to that as well is that with

1511
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,560
my work with what making this

1512
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:29,500
documentary a lot of people have started

1513
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:31,779
to come to me you know through social

1514
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:33,340
media through my website and asking

1515
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:36,400
these same questions you know which way

1516
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:39,309
do I turn and I think that with the buzz

1517
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:42,910
and the excitement of this industry and

1518
00:58:39,309 --> 00:58:46,110
you know CBD as a form of treatment for

1519
00:58:42,909 --> 00:58:50,379
some for a condition like epilepsy I

1520
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:52,780
feel that there is so much out there as

1521
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:53,890
you were saying in regards to it being

1522
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,269
like snake-hole and people don't know

1523
00:58:53,889 --> 00:58:56,920
which way to turn but I you know the

1524
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:59,710
number one thing that I always tell

1525
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:02,050
patients is you know introduce it with

1526
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:05,079
your medicine never ever give up your

1527
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:08,070
medicine always introduce it and see how

1528
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:11,199
you feel yeah for a while because I'm

1529
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:13,510
abruptly stopping your current

1530
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:15,679
pharmaceutical medicine is you know

1531
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:17,810
recipe for disaster and the CSO

1532
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:19,940
and and one little thing to add to that

1533
00:59:17,809 --> 00:59:22,670
is just to you know find your local

1534
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:24,289
licensed dispensary and go there to try

1535
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:26,599

1536
00:59:24,289 --> 00:59:28,519
extraction in California that's where

1537
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:30,949
you're gonna find it instead of going to

1538
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:33,840
a natural food store or somewhere where

1539
00:59:30,949 --> 00:59:35,500
