00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,960

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,160
the executive director of the LA

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,519
cannabis task force thank you all for

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,439
coming out tonight and thank you Jackie

5
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:10,919
for putting this on I'm going to give

6
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:13,079
you a very quick and passion speech with

7
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:14,878
less Smiles today because we are in a

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,640
dire situation right now in the city of

9
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:18,118
Los

10
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,839
Angeles the city proposed regulations

11
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,879
about two weeks ago and their

12
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,399
fundamental the fundamental structure of

13
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:26,320
those regulations are based upon a

14
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,959
certificate of compliance for businesses

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,640
with limited immunity and without

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,880
getting into deep detail into that that

17
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,878
is not a business permit it's not a

18
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:37,000
license and it's really vilifying the

19
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:39,960
industry and treating us like criminals

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,920
still so I ask that everybody on

21
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,160
Thursday comes out to probably the most

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,239
important hearing I know there have been

23
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:46,679
so many hearings in the city of La but

24
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,038
on Thursday there's a planning meeting

25
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,359
hearing it's at 10 to 12:00 a.m. in room

26
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,920
10:10 at City Hall the task force is

27
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,079
going to be there we're mobilizing all

28
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,320
organizations are going to be there

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,119
we're mobilizing everybody to come out

30
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,600
to that meeting and we have to pack that

31
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,479
room and tell the city council that we

32
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,439
must be licensed and permitted

33
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,280
we will not settle for anything less and

34
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,158
they have to move on this I don't care

35
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,560
if they hide behind the City attorney I

36
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,159
don't care who drafted what it's now

37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,600
time that we're treated like legitimate

38
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,040
business people and that's all I really

39
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,039
want to talk about tonight
