1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
all right well we're here with hallie

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,278
and micah from humboldt seed company hi

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,439
guys how's it going hi how's it going

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,599
man doing great thanks for having us

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,519
today thanks exciting to finally all get

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,080
to meet up again and who's this little

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,079
guy this is milo he's basically the team

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,000
mascot

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,000
makes sense makes sense looking forward

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,278
to it um okay so what makes this

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,399
interview slightly different than the

12
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:23,679
other ones we've been doing is that

13
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,799
we've been interviewing farmers and

14
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,800
they've been showing casing their

15
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,199
flowers but you guys are a seed company

16
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,880
yeah so if there's humboldt seed company

17
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,239
and can you tell us a little bit about

18
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,679
how that got started you know like the

19
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,359
background from your dad and what he did

20
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,880
to get that going yeah i mean honestly

21
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,119
when it comes down to it our creation

22
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,480
kind of happened organically basically

23
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:45,038
what you know started was my dad had a

24
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,279
need for reliable seed back in the day

25
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,679
he you know he had had a kid very young

26
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,120
and he was working for the local

27
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,799
fisheries department but we all know

28
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,038
government jobs don't really pay enough

29
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,359
for a family of three so he had his

30
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,879
little crop going and he you know

31
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,558
started getting seeds from his buddies

32
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,320
and sometimes they'd work out great and

33
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,319
sometimes it would basically just come

34
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,319
out like mexi ditch weeded there was no

35
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,759
way of knowing at the time

36
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,599
and you know this is when straight four

37
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,200
thousand dollars a pound

38
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,798
but you know then it was like strains

39
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,320
almost didn't even really have a name

40
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,680
like there was like you know probably 10

41
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,239
different things floating around getting

42
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,000
called salmon creek big bud right and so

43
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,599
he basically just started kind of

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,359
holding on to the things that he liked

45
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,158
and actually saving males and then doing

46
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,000
breeding for his own personal use and it

47
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,600
went from that to neighbors suddenly

48
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,438
being like wait why do all your plants

49
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,640
look uniform and like

50
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,239
you know

51
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
solid they all smell the same and he's

52
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,839
like well that's selective breeding for

53
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,159
you and so next thing you know the

54
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,520
neighbors all wanted seeds and then they

55
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,200
started sending their friends to get

56
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,399
seeds and eventually my stepmom at the

57
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,840
time was like

58
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,079
you can't keep asking folks to bring you

59
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,000
a six pack of beer and you know come

60
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,919
pick out their seeds you're getting fat

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,078
and we're broke

62
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,600
is what it came down to and so that was

63
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,359
honestly the turning point where he was

64
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,879
like maybe i should start charging for

65
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,879
these things that's amazing and that was

66
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,239
way back in like you know i think we

67
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,359
probably didn't ever start charging for

68
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,640
seeds until like 2004 2005 but that's a

69
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,080
long stretch though he's been breeding

70
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,159
since 1998. yeah that's amazing so yeah

71
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,160
i mean from going from that and being

72
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,039
able to you know kind of launch into the

73
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,959
recreational market having an arsenal of

74
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,359
like very stabilized seedlings i think

75
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,598
has been a major advantage to us tonight

76
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,400
our goal has always of course just been

77
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,318
like to expose quality sun-grown flower

78
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,239
to consumers that haven't experienced

79
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,679
that before yeah so to be able to kind

80
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,360
of have our foot in the door already and

81
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,200
to be able to just launch and be ready

82
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,840
to go doing that yeah it seems like you

83
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,598
guys hit the ground running for sure you

84
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,280
know we've we've been

85
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,318
gathering and breeding and hoarding

86
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,680
seeds for decades now so speaking of all

87
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,679
that i mean what are some of the like

88
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,000
management practices like i know mike is

89
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,680
on the farm yeah like what goes into

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
some of that well we're doing mainly a

91
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,599
lot of feminized breeding so we're doing

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,840
we get our dads and we're keeping our

93
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,238
dads and we're switching them and then

94
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,759
we're putting them in these cloths that

95
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,680
protect the pollen

96
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,959
and keep it from cross-pollinating it

97
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,480
just kind of keeps everything like

98
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,878
steady

99
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,039
and then we um it's amazing yeah we just

100
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,639
we go and we do our thing in there yeah

101
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,479
bring the dads in there one thing that i

102
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,919
have to say is like big kudos to all

103
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,759
these guys who take care of our farm

104
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,839
because obviously micah has had years

105
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,919
and years of experience cultivating but

106
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,959
what we do yeah we used to work together

107
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,958
scientific and so much more dialed in to

108
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,199
the point where we're keeping track of

109
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,519
every single plant and what it's doing

110
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,759
in a field of 10 000 plants yeah the

111
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,759
female the great pinot hunt exactly when

112
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,280
we do a lot of selective breeding and so

113
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,439
you know micah is one of the people

114
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,598
that's responsible for you know say a

115
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,919
specific chamber like hella jelly

116
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,919
chamber he's responsible for keeping an

117
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,119
eye on the potential selections that

118
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,199
we're going to save for breeding all

119
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,560
year long yeah walking by them every day

120
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,878
and you're like kind of just looking

121
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,878
like that one's the best one

122
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,318
like right no it's fun yeah no it's so

123
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,239
yeah it's it's fun and i know you're

124
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,280
definitely like a rabbit hole nat does a

125
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,680
lot of

126
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,360
genetic testing he does a lot of testing

127
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,040
and then he's also got these outsourcing

128
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,720
projects where he's like you know these

129
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,239
huge female hunts are going down so

130
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,919
genomics is really interesting been

131
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,680
really important to us and you know

132
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,518
there's a lot of people out there

133
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,519
not to shame like any kind of breeding

134
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,280
because i think it's all with a purpose

135
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,040
and you know it's all interesting but

136
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,039
when it comes down to it if you're just

137
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,319
throwing pollen on something that really

138
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,479
is just pollen checking it's not

139
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,560
breeding selective breeding and focusing

140
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,399
on genomics is a whole different level

141
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,199
yeah back crossing it and getting it to

142
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,439
s1 and like super just straightforward

143
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,439
you know that's the main goal really

144
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,600
pretty much interesting yeah it's

145
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,199
fascinating stuff it's always been an

146
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,280
interest of mine so it's cool having you

147
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,280
guys here didn't talk about it no i mean

148
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,119
i think it'll it'll stay fascinating for

149
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,279
a long time in my opinion because you

150
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,040
know this industry as new as it is i

151
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,399
mean obviously it's not new to us but

152
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,199
it's new to a lot of people and we

153
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,120
haven't had the opportunities to do such

154
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,960
intense genomic testings to work with

155
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,478
labs like uc berkeley in the past

156
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,719
because what we were doing at the time

157
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,879
was illegal and so now it's opened a lot

158
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,639
of doors as far as advancement and

159
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,560
learning about the streams and you know

160
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,199
learning about the effects of different

161
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,759
cannabinoids and terpenes and so i think

162
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,960
you know the more that we dive into this

163
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,960
the more our minds are going to keep

164
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,038
being blown because this plant it's like

165
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,799
it's amazing yeah it's never ending

166
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,719
wonders i know right i was talking about

167
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,160
finding the unicorn you know i know it

168
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,080
leads me into so many different lines of

169
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
questioning about that like you know i

170
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,519
mean what do you guys see in the future

171
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,439
you guys obviously you're working hard

172
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,120
and and trying to develop new products

173
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,560
like do you see anything interesting in

174
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,240
the future like you have future

175
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,120
developments you know we've kind of

176
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,038
learned to not get like too excited by

177
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,639
you know the new crazy thing

178
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,038
like back in the day i think the first

179
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,038
thing was like cbd and we did do like a

180
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,159
few cbd lines and we got kind of into

181
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:47,839
that and we're like is this going to be

182
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,080
like the next huge thing is this going

183
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,918
to take over like what we've learned is

184
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,519
like following hype trains really never

185
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,758
works out for us

186
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,079
and so like we kind of just like follow

187
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,080
our heart

188
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
yeah

189
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,279
what we think is going to be bomb

190
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,879
because like i'm sure you know like when

191
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,719
you walk through the field and you find

192
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,639
one of those unicorns you fucking know

193
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,520
what you want yeah excuse my language

194
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,120
but like

195
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,639
you know you're in a field of 5 000

196
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,639
plants and you think it's impossible to

197
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,560
pick that one winner but when you find

198
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,720
it you really do know it's just like you

199
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,120
see it and it you know blows your mind

200
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,800
you smell it and it blows your mind

201
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,399
too you know it's like

202
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,079
when you take a clone and you you know

203
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,638
you take it back and then you kind of

204
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,800
get to run it you can have that forever

205
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,240
you know once you turn it to a seed yeah

206
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,639
and we've been doing that a lot with our

207
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,478
r d process now for when we you know we

208
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,560
go and we do our phenohunts and we have

209
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,719
our winter selections we will propagate

210
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,120
enough cuts of that to at least run it

211
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,600
one full sun one light depth and you

212
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,720
know one indoor mix light as well

213
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,879
so you know we want to see what it

214
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,680
represents in any environment but really

215
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,839
like

216
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,918
we breed for soul full sun product

217
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,359
because i mean you know in my opinion

218
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:56,959
and

219
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,960
it's honestly one of the things that

220
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,879
like i've had to really like teach

221
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,638
myself that not everyone knows it's not

222
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,399
logic for everyone but to me i'm like

223
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,960
sun grand flower is what it's all about

224
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,959
i love that

225
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,598
the widest expression of the plants yeah

226
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,840
full potential

227
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,240
potential yeah yeah for sure well

228
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,560
speaking of sun grown what do you guys

229
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,840
uh what's your favorite

230
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,240
you know what what are your favorite

231
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,560
seeds that you like to smoke like out of

232
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,000
the seedline what's your favorite

233
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,240
that's always a really tough question

234
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,839
for me but this year i think i'm i'm

235
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,439
really rooting for the farmer's daughter

236
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,239
strain not only because it was a little

237
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,719
bit of a homage to myself

238
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,720
but you know i think that overall that

239
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,960
one definitely has potential for full

240
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,120
sun cultivar cultivators to be getting

241
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,719
you know higher yields higher thc but

242
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,240
also still having that bag appeal that

243
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,759
we're all looking for what is the uh

244
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,800
what did the genetic

245
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,439
the the cross you know the cross is um

246
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,199
that one was our humble pound cake times

247
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,918
what was the rest of it was it wedding

248
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,919
train i think it was wedding

249
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:04,800
oh wow so it's definitely super cakey

250
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,639
kind of purple big chunky nugs nice yeah

251
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,520
amazing what about you michael what do

252
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,759
you like

253
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,478
like i'd say my all-time favorite so i

254
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,080
have

255
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,000
definitely an all-time favorite and then

256
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,839
a new favorite you know my all-time

257
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,918
favorite probably the blueberry muffin

258
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,519
oh yeah i smelled some of that dave it's

259
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,279
so good yeah yeah i could make it like

260
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,639
literally smells like blueberries but i

261
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,598
think my new favorite would probably be

262
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,319
the potty mouth potty mouth yeah it's a

263
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,680
weird crazy cross we did of uh

264
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,280
is it

265
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,479
was it humble pound cake times mountain

266
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,639
top mint

267
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,120
yes i think that's what that was yeah

268
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,879
and that one's just it looks like we had

269
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,360
it grow in full sun and it looked like

270
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,519
indoor was the amount of leaf to nug you

271
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,200
know oh yeah crazy yeah yeah no that

272
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,039
one's a really unique one honestly that

273
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,879
was another one where like i won't ever

274
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,039
forget the day where we really like

275
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,879
fully we were out there taking cuts and

276
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,838
it came from our own farm actually which

277
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,919
is good

278
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,600
but we went up to it and we were like no

279
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,399
this one's the one it just has like

280
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,639
these crazy you know trichome covered

281
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,639
potty bracks basically it's like a

282
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,159
structure it has a great bag appeal to

283
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,799
look at that i keep hearing about it but

284
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,799
i haven't looked

285
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,080
um and then obviously you guys got a big

286
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,838
autoflower line yeah we've been we've

287
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,839
been putting a lot of focus into our

288
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,519
auto lines to be honest like even

289
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,519
personally when they first kind of

290
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,440
started to come around and i you know

291
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,360
did our first little r d batches of the

292
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,160
ones that we'd gathered from you know

293
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,000
corners of all over the world where like

294
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,919
we don't know about these they're like

295
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,958
you know kind of larfy kind of small

296
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,120
kind of

297
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,039
but like as the years have gone on like

298
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,879
man i have to say i never thought i'd

299
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,799
say this but some of them are really

300
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,799
like standing up to photo period lines

301
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,120
for sure they're testing high they're

302
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,039
getting chunky they're getting dense and

303
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,039
they're like frosty yeah they have those

304
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,078
gorgeous frosty representation one thing

305
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,240
is like you know they don't really have

306
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:05,838
nearly as many environmental factors

307
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,919
that they have to deal with because it's

308
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,959
such a short flowering time and because

309
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,399
they're just kind of doing their own

310
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,319
thing it's like if you plant them in the

311
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,078
optimal timing you're not dealing with

312
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,160
like rain you're not dealing with they

313
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,159
don't really care about sun

314
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,240
oh i know they're hearty i yeah your

315
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,159
dad's been kind to me and he's helped

316
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,759
over the last few years i've been using

317
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,360
some of his autos in the spring and it's

318
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,078
been really interesting watching the

319
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,720
evolution of the quality yeah and then

320
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,278
also just the potential of the plant you

321
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,160
know planting in may or ape actually

322
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,159
april

323
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,278
end of april and then watching the plant

324
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,600
grow

325
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,278
not having to do anything with spraying

326
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,800
at all they don't have they're just like

327
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,879
the heart i don't know something happens

328
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,799
with it yeah they go i think the plants

329
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,559
like are shifting so rapidly they're not

330
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,000
releasing the same hormones during

331
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,599
flowering or something's weird's

332
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,600
happening it's kind of crazy how they

333
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,240
they're not attracting veg at the same

334
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,519
tests as much yeah i've noticed that too

335
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,519
actually and i mean that's something

336
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,600
that you know we should definitely look

337
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,278
into a little bit more from a scientific

338
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
stance but if i was going to guess i

339
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,039
would say that it's probably something

340
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,919
similar like you know the the hormones

341
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,360
or even

342
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,599
it's maybe you know it's just something

343
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,360
in the root or alice trait itself where

344
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,959
it's just not as susceptible or the

345
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,399
secondary metabolism yeah the router

346
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,319
allows might have some other secondary

347
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,919
metabolites that it's producing that

348
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,760
we're not quite

349
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,679
tuned into but yeah it's really cool

350
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,360
it's really fascinating watching it so

351
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,958
they've been a huge advantage to like

352
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,879
honestly a lot of growers these days

353
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,639
especially when you know i i highly

354
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,720
recommend people who are doing full term

355
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,000
do an interplanting project where you

356
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,560
kind of just put an auto right in

357
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,480
between oh yeah yeah yeah

358
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,239
you're paying for every square foot you

359
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,399
might as well try to get as much out of

360
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,159
it as possible yep yep it's so

361
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,759
interesting yeah it feels like the way

362
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,600
humboldt seats heading it's like pretty

363
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,639
soon the autos are going to be you're

364
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,720
just going to have

365
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,720
whatever variety you want eventually

366
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,879
it's just going to be like the photo

367
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,278
period variety but in autofocus

368
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,278
basically

369
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,559
yeah well micah helped a lot like this

370
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,799
year with uh

371
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,239
with that we did our caramel cream

372
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,319
autoflower and that one was a

373
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,278
photoperiod strain for quite a few years

374
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,800
before that and so taking it from you

375
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,039
know that

376
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,958
photo period line and then making sure

377
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,360
that it carries all of those traits

378
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,879
while also introducing the ruder alice

379
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,879
is definitely true it's a big

380
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,559
undertaking it doesn't like to split a

381
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,600
lot

382
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,599
and the crazy thing about the

383
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
autoflowers is you can't take clones off

384
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,278
of them i know you have to just breathe

385
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,560
i know i was talking with that about it

386
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,559
it's like you just in it when they're

387
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,239
flipping you're having to reverse that's

388
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,119
what it is deal with a large scale

389
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,879
population so yeah it's fascinating yeah

390
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,159
really cool um all right well i think

391
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:43,278
we've covered pretty much everything

392
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,039
that we would normally would with the

393
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,679
flower guys um

394
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,360
if there's let's see we could end it on

395
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,879
if there's anything that you'd like to

396
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,639
see change with the regulations or

397
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,879
education in the industry what would

398
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,480
what would that one thing be

399
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,639
um you know right now something i've

400
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,800
been really thinking about is how absurd

401
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,959
it is that the tax that people are

402
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,679
paying per pound is not based off of the

403
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,159
price they're getting for said pound

404
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,879
i think that first you know it's just a

405
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,838
brick set exactly well and i think you

406
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,559
know for

407
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,639
sun grown cultivators to actually be

408
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,000
able to have like a winning shot it's

409
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,440
not really fair to be putting them in

410
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,440
the same exact tack

411
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,120
160 dollars although to me yeah

412
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,120
independently

413
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,720
so much more than indoor it's the fact

414
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,480
that we have a lot of uneducated

415
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,680
consumers out there and they don't know

416
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,600
what to ask for when they go into

417
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,399
dispensary and

418
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,320
like realistically that should have been

419
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,240
based off of the price you're receiving

420
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,360
for your pounds in the first place in my

421
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,039
opinion

422
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959
so that's something i would really like

423
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,480
to see change i like it i like that what

424
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,198
about you do you have any

425
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,120
taxes on the square footage and stuff is

426
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,799
just outrageous right now it's kind of

427
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,720
crazy it's a hard market to get into if

428
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,399
you don't have a lot of money and you

429
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,320
know you wouldn't survive a lot of

430
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,360
people aren't surviving right now yeah

431
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,519
it kind of sucks you know micah micah

432
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
and his family have been in the area for

433
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,360
so long micah is you know a native

434
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,600
tribal member and

435
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,800
you know for people in those cultures to

436
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,480
even be able to get their foot in the

437
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,240
door in the cannabis industry it's now

438
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,000
like nearly impossible because if you

439
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,680
don't have

440
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,159
hundreds of thousands of dollars to put

441
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,239
up front for licensing and taxes and for

442
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,000
employment yeah all the upfront costs

443
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,680
like starting a tomato the startup is

444
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,759
just like so different you could start a

445
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,719
tomato farm these people don't want to

446
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,958
grow

447
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,199
normalized a little bit yeah definitely

448
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,719
needs to be normalized for sure

449
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,000
hopefully we'll get some change going as

450
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,759
i think if we come together as a

451
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,519
community in these like groups like this

452
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,519
and start pushing regulators we'll

453
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,120
hopefully make some change so thanks for

454
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,639
your time yeah this has been really

455
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,839
awesome i appreciate coming by and

456
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,839
hanging out so thanks a lot
