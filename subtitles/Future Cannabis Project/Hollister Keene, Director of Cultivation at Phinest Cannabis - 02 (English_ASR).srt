1
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,420
and then this blank client will spend

2
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:26,080
about 21 days 14 of which at almost 100%

3
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,610
humidity before it establishes roots and

4
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,019
we can start acclimating it to lower and

5
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:33,850
lower humidity and higher and higher

6
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:35,469
light levels so that's a little bit of

7
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:40,270
kind of the outline of like so we have

8
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:42,009
stage one initiation stage two is shoot

9
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,750
proliferation which is basically

10
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,759
figuring out the media that the plant is

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,799
actually growing on getting more biomass

12
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,808
that we can multiply it multiply off of

13
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,609
stage three is multiplication and then

14
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:56,619
stage four is this hardening off and

15
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:59,829
routing phase that we do the which

16
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:01,030
process the whole process so this is I'm

17
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:02,530
glad you asked that question because

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,579
this brings me to kind of one of the

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,439
next points that I wanted to talk about

20
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,840
which was just the pros and cons of

21
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,209
tissue culture and there are definite

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,978
pros but there are definite cons it's a

23
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:14,769
more expensive way to produce the plant

24
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:16,810
no question asked you know it's a lot

25
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:18,189
easy it's if you've ever done breeding

26
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,978
before it's really cheap to produce seed

27
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:23,590
how how much do you need consistency

28
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:25,478
across your across your production

29
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,310
system because obviously with seeds you

30
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:30,728
get a huge amount of varying genotypes

31
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,740
and phenotypes so hey I need consistency

32
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:34,780
in my production system I need to grow

33
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:36,188
the same plant so you go to asexual

34
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,920
propagation as opposed to sexual

35
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:40,718
propagation and that's cloning you know

36
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,340
cloning asexual propagation we've all

37
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:42,849
been doing it for years it's not rocket

38
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,079
science

39
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:45,368
keep it pretty clean keep the

40
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,709
environment right give it a little bit

41
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:51,728
of hormone 14 to 18 days you got a new

42
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:55,228
plan so one of the cons is this process

43
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:57,218
does take a long time you can do we say

44
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:58,599
so we work with a lot of clients

45
00:01:57,218 --> 00:02:00,968
throughout the states and we've brought

46
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,759
their genetics and under contract with

47
00:02:00,968 --> 00:02:06,038
you know specific language saying who if

48
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,159
anyone besides them has access to these

49
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:12,879
genetics but we tell people it takes

50
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:14,560
usually 8 to 12 months before when from

51
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,329
when you give me a plant that I can

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,360
induce into tissue culture from when I

53
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,770
can sell you a thousand clones a week up

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,980
off of it's going to be 8 to 10 months

55
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,599
and you know there's different processes

56
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:28,179
and there's different types of tissue

57
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,310
culture but one of the big cons is that

58
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,420
it does take a while and that's one of

59
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,479
the things that we've struggled with

60
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:36,939
especially with how the market can be

61
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,459
very trend driven so it's like you've

62
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:41,530
got the hot strain hey I want fucking I

63
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,060
want 10,000 a month fucking clean ass

64
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,580
tissue culture clone sorry my part my

65
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,229
language on and I'm like awesome I'll be

66
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,390
able to give them to you a year from now

67
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:51,699
when the new hot strain is trending and

68
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:53,589
that doesn't sell anymore no so this is

69
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,719
one of the challenges that we face you

70
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,799
know and

71
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,969
so but yeah I mean so that is definitely

72
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:02,590
one of the cons and there's different

73
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:04,269
processes there different message we can

74
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,549
do something called a quick clean you

75
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:09,700
know where we take the plant in we do a

76
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:12,549
generation or two in vitro or in culture

77
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:14,438
and we can give you 50 or 100 plants

78
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:17,230
back you know that you can then grow out

79
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:19,120
and then what most people do with tissue

80
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:20,889
culture is they tissue culture their

81
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,908
plants and they grow up mom plants of

82
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:24,219
them and then they take traditional

83
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:26,109
clones off of those and then we provide

84
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:27,219
them new tissue cultured plants on a

85
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,900
regular basis

86
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:33,789
so they're always cutting off of clean

87
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:37,480
stock it's it's the same as what we do

88
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:40,298
traditionally so we do and I'll cut back

89
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:42,908
a little bit and if I get it if I get

90
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,810
too granular at any point stop me if

91
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:45,729
you're like I don't know understand what

92
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,110
the fuck you're saying but we do

93
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:49,449
different types of and there's multiple

94
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,360
types of different tissue culture you

95
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:54,128
have noddle propagation you have micro

96
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,989
propagation you have meristem

97
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:58,149
propagation you have callus cell

98
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:01,170
propagation and you have embryo Genesis

99
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:04,900
all these different types depending on

100
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:07,000
what section or amount of cells or

101
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,829
tissues you take to reproduce kind of

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,718
defines what we do we do what's called

103
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:12,819
nodal propagation so we're only taking

104
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:16,209
the lateral nodes and propagating off of

105
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:18,670
those we've found that you have you the

106
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,470
lowest rate of mutation through that

107
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,240
type of tissue culture because other

108
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,250
types of tissue culture work really well

109
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,430
for other things like removing systemic

110
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:30,430
viruses or producing a large volume of

111
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,319
plants in a very small area but you run

112
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,840
a higher risk of mutation on the plant

113
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,500
which is a reality of it's a reality of

114
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,299
clone

115
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,699
we talked about genetic drift which is a

116
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,290
mutation you can see mutation and seed

117
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,209
production where you have intersex

118
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,090
traits from a frenetic trace diploid

119
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:47,709
triploid traits so mutation is a risk

120
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:49,239
that you always run with group

121
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:53,139
reproduction whether it's sexual or

122
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,579
asexual or in beach or ex vitro but it

123
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:56,589
is a risk of tissue culture and so

124
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:58,329
through nodal propagation we see again

125
00:04:56,589 --> 00:05:03,939
the lowest we see the lowest rate of

126
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:05,889
mutation now I think there's a decent

127
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:08,500
way to segue into like one of the big

128
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:10,870
advantages of the tissue culture process

129
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:15,490
is this this reinvigoration that you see

130
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:17,889
of the plant and again I am I have not

131
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,990
spent nearly as long working in tissue

132
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:21,879
culture as some of our partners have but

133
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,829
even talking with them I've tried to

134
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,168
press them to understand why does a

135
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:29,168
plant regenerate when it goes through

136
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:32,259
tissue culture process process why can I

137
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:34,599
take a 20 year old og cush clone that is

138
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:36,759
just not performing like it used to it's

139
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,070
way more susceptible diseases and pests

140
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,050
than it used to be why can I take that

141
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:43,839
through the tissue culture process and

142
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:50,319
it comes out healthier and stronger and

143
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:54,219
growing like a seedling again I don't

144
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:57,579
think we're screwing it up and yeah it's

145
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:00,400
party screening so the thing that we

146
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:02,589
really see in this is I had like a

147
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,939
double doctorate tell me this they me

148
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:07,149
when I first asked this question he was

149
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:08,800
like the plant forgets how old it is and

150
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:12,009
I was like what the hell does that mean

151
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,740
you know but it is there is somehow your

152
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:17,168
the cells have a genetic memory the

153
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,509
plant has an age we all age senescence

154
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:21,969
is a natural process of all biological

155
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:24,728
organisms and plants have this as well

156
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:28,060
and somehow through this tissue culture

157
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:31,539
process the plant is resetting itself

158
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,250
and it's resetting its genetic age so

159
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,710
you'll take a plant that's been growing

160
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,689
and again has all these what we maybe

161
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:38,579
call undesirable traits after a long

162
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:42,598
time

163
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:44,180
of traditional asexual propagation its

164
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:46,288
since eight months in tissue culture

165
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,569
generation after generation after

166
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:52,288
generation getting micro propagated in

167
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:54,270
vitro with zero biotic stress no

168
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:56,399
bacteria fuckin was it no pest fuckin

169
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:58,560
with it the perfect climate the perfect

170
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,658
temperature everything all the right mix

171
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,918
of nutrients hormones sugars vitamins

172
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:06,538
everything we grow those plants out and

173
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:10,168
they do equal opposite branching again

174
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:11,939
the way a seed does and it's like holy

175
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:14,339
shit this is there is something going on

176
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:16,110
here the plant is in I will say one

177
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,439
caveat we haven't seen that across the

178
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,389
board

179
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,389
I'd say 70% of the strains that were

180
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:23,009
showing symptoms of degradation we can

181
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:25,590
take through the tissue culture process

182
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:27,598
and within eight months to a year of

183
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:29,459
being in tissue culture they come out

184
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,978
growing better than they did before but

185
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,870
not every single strain and ultimately

186
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:36,418
we think it is just it's the amount of

187
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,728
time that it spends in vitro so this

188
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:42,209
quick clean process that we have done we

189
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:44,008
really now only do four meristem tissue

190
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:48,750
culture which is what I'll talk about

191
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:51,240
now is taking a different set of cells

192
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,810
and in propagating and multiplying from

193
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,949
that the advantage of meristem culture

194
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:00,418
raising has do we know what the marathon

195
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:01,710
is on a plant so meristem is a region of

196
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:03,299
the plant there's multiple you have a

197
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:04,560
meristem in the growing tips you have a

198
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,478
meristem in the roots you have a

199
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,658
meristem actually in the stem region as

200
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,310
well it's an area of rapid cell division

201
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:12,810
that's happening in the plant the

202
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,629
interesting thing about this these

203
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:19,019
regions in the plant is that if the

204
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:21,949
plant say has you guys been hearing

205
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:25,620
anything about hemp latent virus

206
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:27,419
recently so if there is a systemic virus

207
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,519
in the plant systemic meaning that it is

208
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:30,930
not a pathogen that's external and

209
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,218
affecting the plant from the outside

210
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,099
that it's actually a pathogen that's

211
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,349
reproducing inside of the plant viruses

212
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,019
are this way and it's very prevalent

213
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:43,199
other agricultural crops this

214
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:46,560
meristematic region of the plant the

215
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:48,750
cell division is happening so fast that

216
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,189
you can have new healthy cells that

217
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,049
contain all the genomic mature

218
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,390
grow a new plant that is not yet

219
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:56,819
connected to the vascular tissue of the

220
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:58,379
plant the vascular tissue being what

221
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,710
transports all the water and all the

222
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:04,259
sugar through the plant and so you can

223
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,019
take this cell cluster from the meristem

224
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:08,700
and produce a genetically identical

225
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:10,889
perfectly healthy plant that's outgrown

226
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,020
the virus that is not yet been infected

227
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,879
by the virus that's running through the

228
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:19,740
xylem and the phloem the vascular tissue

229
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:21,539
of the plant so I worked briefly with

230
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,340
Driscoll's right out of college I'm sure

231
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:24,959
no big berry growers and all of their

232
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,180
plants are produced through meristem

233
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,490
tissue culture so they're taking again

234
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:31,500
the very very very growing tip of the

235
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,269
plant and this is something you have to

236
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,639
do in a microscope you pull that growing

237
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:37,319
tip you scrape off all the Leafs all the

238
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:39,720
leaf primordia and you get this

239
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,030
meristematic dome it's this area of

240
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,620
rapid cell division again all the

241
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:45,509
genetic material to grow an identical

242
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,580
plant but it's not connected to the

243
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:51,149
vascular tissue and you can culture that

244
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,710
meristem and grow a virus free plant so

245
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:54,659
Driscoll's at their facility up in Red

246
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,340
Bluff that's what they do for all their

247
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:58,379
berries and then what they do is they

248
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,180
grow that tissue culture meristem

249
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:02,070
strawberry plant into a mother plant and

250
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,479
they take traditional clones off of that

251
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,850
and that's what they provide to all

252
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,789
their growers disease free virus free

253
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,820
pest free plants that's what we're

254
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:15,000
trying to do at finest candidates so

255
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,250
this meristem process is the only like

256
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,740
quick clean process that what we do now

257
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,500
and meristem takes longer than

258
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,149
traditional noddle propagation so when I

259
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,009
say click quick lean you're still

260
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:29,009
looking at probably six months till I

261
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:34,189
could give you a flat of meristem

262
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:37,429
regenerated disease-free plants back so

263
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,430
yeah please

264
00:10:40,509 --> 00:11:04,159
yep it's a good question I think so we

265
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:07,399
haven't had that positive intentions

266
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:10,339
obviously yet if we do I'll definitely

267
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:13,189
be the first to tell you know most of

268
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:15,680
the mutations that we see are increased

269
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,060
intersex traits so we evaluate every

270
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,129
plant that we take through tissue

271
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:20,719
culture we evaluate in-house in our

272
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:22,850
facility before we release it to the

273
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,430
public we grow it out to make sure that

274
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,779
there is a mutation I mean I don't think

275
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:28,609
it's I don't think I'm speaking out of

276
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:30,649
line and I say like a lot of the

277
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,560
cannabis cultivars that are widely

278
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:36,860
circulated and grown and loved have

279
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:40,639
intersex or hermaphroditic traits this

280
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:47,600
is the result of like extremely rapid

281
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:49,220
and somewhat unmonitored breeding that's

282
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,320
happened in the cannabis community and

283
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,790
so a lot of traits that maybe weren't

284
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,740
noticed or documented are getting passed

285
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:57,049
along and passed along to the gene pool

286
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,060
you know cannabis is pretty unique in

287
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,519
the angiosperm family that it's it's

288
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:03,589
deiicious it has male and female plants

289
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,069
that have flowers that have totally

290
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,830
different reproductive organs and it's

291
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,210
one of the challenges there are not

292
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:14,180
cannabis is right now one of the only

293
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:16,370
plants except papaya that is dioecious

294
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:18,019
and as being tissue cultured so it's

295
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:21,379
something that we're we're really

296
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:24,139
looking at pretty actively is what what

297
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:25,970
do we see yeah what do we see with with

298
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:27,350
with dioecious plants and intersex

299
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,090
traits when we start to do the tissue

300
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,279
culture process especially when we start

301
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,500
to talk about things like embryo Genesis

302
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,779
which is another type of plant tissue

303
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,450
culture where you're you guys familiar

304
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:40,509
with like stem cells so it's basically

305
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:43,040
stem cell growth for plants we take

306
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:44,179
plant material in and you can put it in

307
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,610
the media and it grows what's called a

308
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:48,179
callous and callus is just

309
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,460
undifferentiated

310
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:53,219
and sell it can doubt those cells

311
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,200
depending on what biotic or abiotic

312
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,879
stimulus they get they can become a leaf

313
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,640
they can become a root they can become a

314
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,980
chute they can become a flower

315
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,778
embryogenesis is a way to produce a huge

316
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,509
number of plants in a small area you can

317
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:10,889
take a piece of callus the size of a

318
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:12,470
pinhead and get it to grow 75 plants out

319
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:14,519
of it

320
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,370
embryogenesis is something that's not

321
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,230
done in a lot of crops again because of

322
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,330
the mutation rate we're currently doing

323
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,839
trials as embryogenesis right now to see

324
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,610
if it's something that's even viable so

325
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:30,529
again I don't want to get I don't want

326
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:33,360
to get too too granular one of the other

327
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:34,620
one of the other things at least for me

328
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,570
that has been really interesting about

329
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,019
the tissue culture process and learning

330
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:42,000
as the just the idea of germ plasm the

331
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,370
idea of start being able to store a vast

332
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,679
amount of genetic material I mean anyone

333
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:49,320
who's ever tried to do a breeding

334
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:51,329
program or done breeding in-house or

335
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,670
even tried to keep mother stock around

336
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,410
knows that it can be problematic it can

337
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:58,620
be challenging to keep mother stock

338
00:13:55,409 --> 00:14:03,059
around and not to mention if you want to

339
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:07,169
have 10 20 100 300 cultivars that you

340
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:11,579
can be able to cycle through so German

341
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:12,929
just the genetic banking part is a is a

342
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,830
really big advantage of tissue culture

343
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:18,509
so we we offer that program to actually

344
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,278
a handful of breeders as well who they

345
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:22,259
have a a library of genetic material

346
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:23,970
that they don't want to have to keep

347
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:28,009
alive and potentially lose or have

348
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,009
potentially get infected with with pests

349
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,879
you
