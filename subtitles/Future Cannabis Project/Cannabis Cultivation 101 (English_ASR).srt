00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:05,298
[Music]

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:13,199
We manage a 30,000 foot facility in

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:15,359
Phoenix. We have a second 35,000t

4
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,799
facility coming online at the end of the

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:22,559
year. Uh we have a 20,000t facility

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,640
coming online in Vegas. Um we develop

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,079
strains. We also have a proprietary

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,679
cannabis cannabis specific fertilizer uh

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,839
which we call clay 9. Um I've been in

10
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:37,280
the industry

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,440
for 17 8 years. Thank you for everyone

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,480
uh giving me a chance to speak about my

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:46,079
favorite uh my favorite topic which is

14
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:49,199
cannabis cultivation. Um so today this

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,000
is more geared towards the beginning

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,039
cultivation

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,840
um rookie. I would like to say um I I

18
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,000
know Lisa Lisa asked how many of you are

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,920
new to the industry and and so this

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,558
presentation is more geared towards

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,599
those of you who are interested in kind

22
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,640
of investing into cannabis

23
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,959
cultivation. So are you guys ready to

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,159
go? I know I got a limited time so I'm

25
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,158
just going to try to rifle through it.

26
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,560
Um,

27
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,240
so all right. One of the the questions I

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,400
always get is how do I invest in

29
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:26,959
cannabis cultivation? Um, there's three

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,560
options. And sorry, there's three

31
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,959
options to invest in cannabis

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,680
cultivation. Indoor, greenhouse, or

33
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:39,118
straight outdoor. The most popular is

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,520
probably indoor just because of the

35
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,680
state of the plant that we're growing.

36
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,679
It's been illegal for so long. There's

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,159
been so many indoor cultivations trying

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,840
to evade law enforcement. So, I'm going

39
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,600
to go through some of the pros and cons

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,478
first of indoor. We'll go through

41
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,599
greenhouse and then outdoor. Um, so

42
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,078
indoor cultivation, here's a picture of

43
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,438
one of our rooms in

44
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:03,839
Phoenix. One of the pros is you have

45
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,718
very consistent quality of your product.

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,239
The weather doesn't hinder the product.

47
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,560
No rain. You don't have to worry about

48
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,560
the temperature variation.

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,719
uh you could also perpetually harvest

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,680
the product. So once again, because

51
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,959
there's no weather affecting your

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,680
product, you could do what you want to

53
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,120
do. You are God. Basically, you control

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,080
the environment. Um you might argue also

55
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,480
that the indoor product, the indoor

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,360
flower is higher quality. I know

57
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,679
greenhouse in outdoor people will argue,

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,239
but you might be right. Maybe the

59
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,239
outdoor quality is better. the

60
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,159
greenhouse quality might be better, but

61
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,039
there's no doubt about it that if you're

62
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,439
producing indoor flowers, you're going

63
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,079
to get a higher retail value. There's no

64
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,598
question about it.

65
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,800
Um,

66
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:57,039
now, one of the pros uh that people

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,239
don't think about is you actually get to

68
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,120
recycle a lot of water indoors versus

69
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,360
outdoors.

70
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,480
Outdoors, you're using water and you're

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,640
not really using any highintensive

72
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,759
equipment like HVAC and dehumidification

73
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,359
necessarily. And all of the water

74
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,318
generated by that equipment you could

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,080
actually recycle. So that's one pro. The

76
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,919
con of course is that the same

77
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,280
electricity that generates all that

78
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:28,079
water you could recycle is uh not

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,239
environment environmentally friendly.

80
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,680
Um, so anyway, those are some of the

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,039
pros of indoor cultivation. Um, some

82
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,959
might argue there's more cons. Uh, one

83
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,439
of the number one cons of indoor

84
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,000
cultivation is the uh, the expense. It's

85
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:47,598
very expensive to start up an indoor

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,199
cultivation. Uh, anyone by show of

87
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,518
hands, how many people have an indoor

88
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,919
cultivation running right now? So, you

89
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,319
guys probably know the expense up front.

90
00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:00,318
The 30,000 square foot facility we built

91
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:03,119
in Phoenix cost I think 4 million. Um I

92
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:06,199
know of a facility in Illinois that's

93
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,879
75,000 square ft. I think it cost 16

94
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:12,238
million. So that is a big con. Obviously

95
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:15,438
there's a lot of upfront investment. Um

96
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,199
also there's a lot of expertise required

97
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,719
to pull off indoor cultivations

98
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,600
effectively continuously over time

99
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,199
without problems. Um, obviously it's

100
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,240
environmentally taxing because of all

101
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,040
the power that you have to use to indoor

102
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,519
to cultivate indoors. And another con is

103
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,439
the cost of

104
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:38,639
production. It's anywhere from, you

105
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,800
know, $2 a gram up for indoor

106
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,199
cultivation. This is like boutique, you

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,079
know, really high-end product. And

108
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,478
another con of course is

109
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:50,800
that there is really no school of

110
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,439
design. You have an indoor cultivation.

111
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,079
If you if you invest in a space, how do

112
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,279
you design it most efficiently? Right?

113
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,879
You go to you go to school for

114
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,119
engineering or architecture, they're

115
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,519
going to teach you maybe efficient ways

116
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,000
to design a facility. Well, we're just

117
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,120
learning as we go indoors. So, really,

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,560
that's a big con because who knows what

119
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,000
the best way to grow is. Maybe we

120
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,120
haven't got there yet, but it's always

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,360
evolving. So, that's a good

122
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,600
thing. You guys hear me? Okay, good.

123
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,199
Now, growing in a greenhouse. uh growing

124
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,199
in a greenhouse. There's obviously the

125
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,478
pros are the costs up front are much

126
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,520
lower. Um it's less taxing

127
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:29,038
environmentally. The product quality is

128
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,159
still very good. Especially here in

129
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,519
California, we have a long history of

130
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,759
cultivation. Uh there I know a lot of

131
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,959
incredible greenhouse growers and of

132
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,038
course they're going to argue their

133
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,719
product is better than the indoor. Um

134
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,319
and it may be it's in many cases, but uh

135
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,240
that is definitely one of the pros. You

136
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,240
could still grow really, really good

137
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,879
quality cannabis, really good quality

138
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,120
medicine, and the cost is less. Cost of

139
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,959
production in a greenhouse, if you're

140
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,800
really efficient, you could get it down

141
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,599
to about a dollar per gram. That's about

142
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,800
half the indoor cost. Retail sale value

143
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,720
though is probably a lot less. Um, some

144
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,439
of the cons of a greenhouse obviously

145
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,000
are the production quality is not as

146
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,319
consistent year round. uh the lower

147
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,360
retail value which I mentioned before

148
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,080
and of course you still are outdoors

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,120
there's bugs there's fungus there's

150
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:22,079
molds things that are much more

151
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,240
difficult to control I I got a chance to

152
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:28,198
to visit one of the largest greenhouse

153
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,759
producers in Canada they have I think

154
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:34,360
400,000 square ft of greenhouse space

155
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:38,560
and they're surrounded by other green

156
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,160
houses that grow produce and because of

157
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,280
the environment. They're continually

158
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,280
battling powder mildew. So being in a

159
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:50,799
greenhouse is uh has the one big con is

160
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,478
that you cannot control the environment.

161
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,478
But but but the product is really good.

162
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:57,639
So if you're thinking of investing, the

163
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:01,120
greenhouse is a is a very good way to

164
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:03,598
go. All right. Outdoor cultivation.

165
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,360
Outdoor in the industry, we we say it's

166
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,839
a a little bit different than greenhouse

167
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,360
because you're strictly outdoor. There's

168
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,679
no cover. Um, this is a friend of mine's

169
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,199
picture. He's probably upset that I'd be

170
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,959
using his picture, but I won't tell you

171
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,120
where it is. This is in Southern

172
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,519
California,

173
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,639
though. He has an acre grow in Southern

174
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:27,839
California outdoor crazy. But outdoor

175
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,079
cultivation is obviously um great

176
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,399
because the cost is very low. You have

177
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,399
no structure to build. He put up this

178
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,638
screen because of the heat. So, the

179
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,279
screen protects from the the the heat

180
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,840
intensity

181
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:44,318
basically. So, like I said in uh outdoor

182
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,000
cultivation, some of the pros are the

183
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,400
sun is free. You don't have to pay for

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,918
the sun, at least not yet. You know,

185
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,079
maybe if Trump gets elected, he'll try

186
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,079
to charge for sun. I don't know. But the

187
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,680
sun is free. It's beautiful. Um it's

188
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,639
beautiful to be outdoors. The startup

189
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,800
costs are very low. Um and the cost of

190
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,038
your production is very low. So, those

191
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,079
are some of the pros of being outdoor.

192
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,318
The cons of course are security. Uh

193
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,800
outdoor growers are constantly worried

194
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,879
about getting robbed. I know many many

195
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,879
friends who have been robbed pre-h

196
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,400
harvest. Within like a week of harvest

197
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,599
all of a sudden their crop is cut down

198
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,679
and it's gone. It's robbed. So uh

199
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,000
outdoors that's one of the the concerns

200
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,918
you always have. I should have mentioned

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,399
that indoor that's also a concern but

202
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,719
outdoor

203
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:33,000
especially. Um outdoors of course you

204
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,519
have the pest and the disease the the

205
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,440
insects. One thing for sure outdoors

206
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,278
that you have that you don't have in a

207
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,519
greenhouse or indoor you have to worry

208
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:44,639
about animals. Some animals love to eat

209
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,480
pot. You're indoors. You don't have to

210
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,838
worry about that. There are some humans

211
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,959
that like to eat pot too. You have to

212
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,440
worry about them. Um quality is not as

213
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:57,119
consistent outdoors. Obviously that's a

214
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,279
big drawback of outdoor cultivation. Um,

215
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,320
but in general, you get you you get a

216
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:04,320
very nice uh traditional crop outdoors

217
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,879
if if weather permits and you're in the

218
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,800
right

219
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,360
location. All right. Um, so once you've

220
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:14,240
decided on the facility, the type of way

221
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,839
you're going to grow, you you should

222
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,159
figure out what strains you're going to

223
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,440
grow. I know we talked about strains,

224
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,679
sorry, earlier. And uh there's certain

225
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,640
strains that some people find great for

226
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,879
certain ailments. Bubba Kush, right, to

227
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,639
keep you sedated. It's a Bubba. Bubba

228
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,639
Kush is one of my favorites. Matter of

229
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,879
fact, this strain here, Snake Eyes, is a

230
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,958
hybrid of OG and Bubba. So, it kind of

231
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,600
gives you the best of both worlds. But

232
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,759
if you're looking in the industry as an

233
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,080
investment opportunity, there's

234
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,958
definitely a short list of strains that

235
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,480
are extremely popular. Number one, I

236
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:52,000
think if you're in the industry, you

237
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,800
probably know it's OG Kush. OG Kush is

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,159
been probably the best seller for 10

239
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:00,319
years, maybe longer. Um, Girl Scout

240
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:03,360
cookies, you guys know that one. Girl

241
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,278
Scout is a very popular strain also. And

242
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,440
and to be honest, Girl Scout is similar

243
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,838
to it's like a Bubba OG hybrid in my

244
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,320
opinion. Uh, but OG, Girl Scout, Bubba

245
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,760
Kush, and Tangi, which is kind of like

246
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,040
an interesting um hybrid that has like

247
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,799
this really

248
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:23,519
strong citrus, right? It's like a citrus

249
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,759
kind of like tangerine smell. Uh is also

250
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,799
kind of popular. Now people I know a lot

251
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,439
of people hear about CBD strains. If you

252
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,719
actually own a

253
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,360
dispensary, there isn't really a demand

254
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,278
for CBD as you would imagine. Um

255
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,959
although of course there there are tons

256
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:43,200
of people in need of CBD strains, but as

257
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,518
a whole in the recreational market, it's

258
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,959
a small percentage of the market. Just

259
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,759
so you know, a lot of people might

260
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,679
assume that if I had a whole board of

261
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,360
CBD strains, I'm going to kill it on the

262
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:57,278
retail side. Probably not going to

263
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,360
happen. OG Kush, Bubba Kush, Girl Scout,

264
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,919
have some nice sativas, and then have

265
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,120
CBDs for the true medicinal patients.

266
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:08,399
Um, the name game. Do you guys know

267
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,959
about the the strain name game?

268
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,360
cultivators probably know the name game

269
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,119
is just this idea that dispensaries will

270
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,159
change the name of their strains because

271
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,360
they're more popular. Um, so you know,

272
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,838
one of the things you'll learn as you

273
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,440
get in the industry, there's specific

274
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,839
strains that have a specific effect

275
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,560
in look and smell and then there's

276
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,200
people that just name everything that.

277
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,000
So anyway, genetics are very important.

278
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,320
That's the

279
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,679
point. All right. So once you've decided

280
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,760
to grow, you've figured out your

281
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,599
strains, you have your facility, where

282
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,159
are you going to get your genetics?

283
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,920
There's two sources that you're going to

284
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:52,600
get your genetics. One is from seed and

285
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,120
the other is from a clone. If you're in

286
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,440
California and you can easily get access

287
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,839
to genetics, you're probably going to go

288
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,959
for clones because seeds have a lot of

289
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,079
variation. um the seed producing

290
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,199
companies haven't gotten to the level of

291
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:09,759
sophistication that they've gotten to

292
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,600
with big a with genetic modification. So

293
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,120
you have a lot of variation. So if

294
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,519
you're growing production, you want to

295
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,000
go from a clonebased strain and you you

296
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,799
want to make sure that your source is uh

297
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,480
very well reputable. Um I would say one

298
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,719
of the best sources for clones is

299
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,839
probably Elemental Wellness in San Jose.

300
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,000
They carry a lot of

301
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:32,680
uh a lot of clones from really respected

302
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,519
farms like uh what is it? Darkheart

303
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:38,000
Nursery and a bunch of others I can't

304
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,759
think of. But if you're going the clone

305
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,799
route, make sure you go to a reput

306
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,799
reputable clone vendor.

307
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,360
Oh, the the clone vendor that I like is

308
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,439
Elemental Wellness in San Jose. They're

309
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,159
very reputable.

310
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,200
Um, now if you decide to grow from

311
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,799
seeds, which you may if you're out of

312
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,879
state, if you're in California, you

313
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,039
probably want to go from clone. There's

314
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,519
a lot of disadvantages and advantages.

315
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,679
Either way, seeds, the one beauty is

316
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,000
that you could store them for many, many

317
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,638
years. I've had seeds that I've stored

318
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,958
for over a decade and they still sprout

319
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,639
with a really high germination rate. Uh,

320
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,518
the growth is really vigorous from

321
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,200
seeds. uh you get a you get a lot of

322
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
variation and that might not be good if

323
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,399
you're a producer but if you're a

324
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,119
breeder that's great because you can

325
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,720
find something really unique. Uh also

326
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,839
the advantage is if you're growing from

327
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,879
a seed they're free from pest. You're

328
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,800
not going to get something that's

329
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,399
infected. If you're buying a clone on

330
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,319
the other hand you never know. It might

331
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,639
be carrying powder mildew could have

332
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,120
broad mites. Something really nasty that

333
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,680
could ruin your entire garden. Um, so

334
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,000
you know, whatever way you you decide to

335
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,039
go, you have to be careful. But clones,

336
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,799
I would say you have more advantages and

337
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:56,240
disadvantages. The cost for seeds is

338
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:59,838
about 5 to 10 retail. For clones, it's

339
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,799
about 5 to 25. 25 is really high-end if

340
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,800
you're buying something from uh a vendor

341
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,439
that's really unique, but usually it's

342
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,278
about I would say $12 is the average

343
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,160
retail price of a

344
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:15,198
clone. All right. Now, when you get your

345
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:18,319
clones, you don't have to worry about

346
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:20,958
about this with seeds. Um, but there's a

347
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,560
lot of common cannabis pests that wreak

348
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,159
har that wreak carnage on on

349
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:30,638
cultivators. And, uh, what keeps me up

350
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:33,120
at night? Uh, in in terms of the pest,

351
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,039
probably broad mites. They're the no

352
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,278
rust mites. They're a little different.

353
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,439
They attack the plant in a similar way.

354
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,198
But um let me go through the list and

355
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,000
I'll tell you a little bit about the the

356
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,799
broad in Russets. Oh. Ah, they're so

357
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,320
bad. The two spotted spidermite, which

358
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,159
is uh that

359
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,760
guy

360
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:55,519
there on the left there, that's the the

361
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,360
two spotted spidermite. This is probably

362
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,799
the most common pest in cannabis

363
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,560
gardens. Um and and if you get it, you

364
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:05,198
you really got to isolate your plant.

365
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:08,078
And I would say in a if you want to take

366
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:10,000
care of it in a safe way, uh, aidactin

367
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:14,120
is probably your best bet. Some of the

368
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,879
products on the market are uh, Azimax,

369
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,679
a it's a it's a good product. They won't

370
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:22,000
kill it completely unless you're really

371
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:25,599
really anal. What I would do is I would

372
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,919
actually isolate my plants, spray them,

373
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,120
and then look through them with like my

374
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:33,360
naked eye and literally pop each mic by

375
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,519
hand. And I would do that for weeks

376
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,519
until they're all completely gone. And

377
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,198
then you could also use bug bombs and

378
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,000
stuff that's a lot more harmful. But if

379
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,639
you're trying to be organic, uh, use

380
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,480
something like aidactin. Now, rusted in

381
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,000
broad mites are like on a whole another

382
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,320
level because they do this insane damage

383
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,278
to the plant and you can't see them,

384
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,199
which makes it very difficult to spot.

385
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,720
With with the twospotted spidermite, at

386
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,479
least you could see it with the naked

387
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,480
eye if you look close enough. Even

388
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,800
though I'm almost blind basically, I

389
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,680
could still see them. Broad and russet

390
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,240
mites, you have to use a microscope and

391
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,958
they attack the buds where the two

392
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,720
spotted spider might attacks the leaves.

393
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,479
So, and it's if you look at the

394
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,720
structure of a flower, a cannabis

395
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,360
flower, it's so convoluted, it's really

396
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,440
hard to see what's going on. But rusted

397
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,199
and broad mites. The picture here in the

398
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,320
middle, the picture in the middle there

399
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,719
is russet mites and they attack the buds

400
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,399
and they spread very quickly. You could

401
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,560
also use aidactin on broad mites. I did

402
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,519
an experiment where I sprayed actually

403
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:42,000
sprayed with a duractin counted the

404
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,480
number of broad mites before and after

405
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,399
and it killed about 80% of them. Problem

406
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,879
is if you don't kill them all they're

407
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,639
going to replicate really quick. Um, I

408
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,879
also I've never done this, but I've

409
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,799
heard sulfur. It works really well with

410
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:59,679
broad and russets. Um, another common

411
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,359
cannabis pest is thris. Unfortunately, I

412
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,879
don't have a picture of the thris, but

413
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,720
they what they do is they kind of attack

414
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,000
the le and etch it out and it makes this

415
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,519
weird silvery kind of pattern. Um, and

416
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,279
they're easy to take care of for the

417
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:15,279
most part with something called spinoad,

418
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:17,759
spinad. Uh, fungusnats are those guys

419
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,759
there on the right. These ones won't

420
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,919
kill your crop and they're very

421
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,599
difficult to get rid of. Most growers

422
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,919
that I know, at least on the commercial

423
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,599
scale, have just decided that yes, we

424
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,600
could just live with the fungus nats.

425
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,959
We'll do our best to keep them at bay,

426
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,439
but they're going to be part of the

427
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,079
room. And they they what they do is they

428
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,160
burrow into the roots and they like to

429
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:41,240
suck on the sorry, they burrow into the

430
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,360
soil and they like to eat the roots.

431
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:48,558
Um, white flies are another insect that

432
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,558
like to eat cannabis. I haven't had much

433
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,319
problems with white flies. I know

434
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,480
regionally it's different. In Arizona, I

435
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,678
know white flies are worse. Uh, I

436
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,880
suggest using like lace wings or lady

437
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,120
beatetles and unleash them in your

438
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,919
garden and they'll they'll do a pretty

439
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,959
decent job of eating the white flies.

440
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,960
Now, last is the tobacco budworms. If

441
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,279
you grow outdoors, I know for sure you

442
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,679
know caterpillars, budworms will wreak

443
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:18,160
havoc wreak havoc on your uh on your

444
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:22,320
crop. And and one of the ways to destroy

445
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:25,279
budworms is with BT or basillusensis.

446
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,399
It's like a it's basically a beneficial

447
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,480
bacteria that you could put into the

448
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,880
soil or spray on the plant that will

449
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,279
just kill the budworms and kill their

450
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,080
larvae. Um anyway, those are the common

451
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:40,639
cannabis

452
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:41,879
pests. Mildews, molds, and micotoxins.

453
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,320
Oh

454
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,320
my. Powdery mildew by far is the worst.

455
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,399
The I I think it's the bane of all

456
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,960
cannabis cultivators. It spreads

457
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,720
quickly. It's hard to contain and it

458
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,519
will develop resistance to

459
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,679
um fungicides. So, it it's a it's a very

460
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,079
difficult thing to control. And as state

461
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,200
regulations come down the road, the

462
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,519
states are now testing for fungus counts

463
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,600
and mold counts and spore counts. So,

464
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,558
you can't just live with PM. You can't

465
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,719
sell bud with PM, at least not in the

466
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,678
future. Now, you could get away with it.

467
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,120
Uh, but these are the types of things

468
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,640
you have to look out if you're getting

469
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,918
into cultivation. powdery mildew,

470
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,400
micotoxins, which are like a secondary

471
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,919
metabolite of certain fungi like

472
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,559
aspiggillis, uh, and betritis. Betritis

473
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,960
is a, uh, I think they call it bud rot.

474
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,119
Basically, it's when your bud just

475
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,440
starts to decay from the inside out.

476
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,639
It's horrible, horrible plague. The good

477
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,840
thing, excuse me. The good thing about

478
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,320
betritis is that betritis is very strain

479
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,439
specific. If you are growing OG Kush or

480
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,279
Bubba because of the bud structure, it's

481
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,640
unlikely you're going to get betritis.

482
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,440
If you're growing Blue Dream or

483
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,919
something really airy and big, then

484
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,320
betritis is much more likely. And

485
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,000
there's ways to combat those, too. But

486
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,879
anyway, those are some things you have

487
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,880
to look out

488
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,720
for. Okay, so now we've got to the point

489
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,640
we have seeds or we have clones. We're

490
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,400
growing them. With seeds, you could

491
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,480
germinate in paper towels. What I like

492
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,360
to do is take my seeds, put them in

493
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,679
water, and then wait about 24 hours, and

494
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,000
then put them in paper towels. And then

495
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,159
at some point, you'll have a tap routt

496
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,480
that forms. And the tap routt is that

497
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,559
little white thing sticking out of the

498
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,839
seed

499
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,440
there. And you could see over a couple

500
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,319
of days, the roots will develop and

501
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,320
they'll grow. Um, I think technically

502
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,720
they're called a radical root. When the

503
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,639
radical root gets to a certain size, you

504
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,360
want to transplant it to your medium,

505
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,360
whatever it is. Um, I would say that guy

506
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,479
down there is a little bit too, you let

507
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:54,319
it go a little too long here. It'll

508
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,440
still work. You could still transplant

509
00:20:54,319 --> 00:21:00,240
it, but I would suggest going for

510
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,080
something about there. That's perfect.

511
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,960
That gu is perfect right in the middle.

512
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,240
Transplant it when it gets to about that

513
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,919
stage. And I know most of you are

514
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,079
probably going to go from clone if

515
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,120
you're cultivating anyway. So, let me

516
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,798
shuffle through the seeds real

517
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:17,558
quick just really quickly. Here's a seed

518
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:20,720
that's sprouting. This is

519
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:23,519
probably three three days after the

520
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,880
picture we just saw. And the growth that

521
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,558
you're looking at in this picture

522
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,039
probably happens over the course of a

523
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,678
day. Um, notice that in the last

524
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,759
picture, the seed is kind of stuck on

525
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,759
top of the leaves. These leaves are

526
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,879
called

527
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,200
kodalons. Notice that they don't look

528
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,120
like normal pot leaves. the ones that

529
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,558
are kind of rounded, that's where the

530
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:48,038
plant gets all of its uh initial

531
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:50,558
nutrition to start the

532
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:54,000
growth. All right. Now, this is just a

533
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:56,879
an interesting example of how seeds are

534
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
viable for so long. Um, this is a

535
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,520
picture of four skunk number one seeds.

536
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,319
These are actually the original skunk

537
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:07,038
number one straight from Dave Watson.

538
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,599
Does anyone know who Dave Watson is? So,

539
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,759
these are from his collection, and these

540
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,599
have been frozen for 15 years, and they

541
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,359
still sprouted. So, that's one of the

542
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,879
beauty of seeds. They have this great

543
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:21,279
long-term storage

544
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:24,000
capacity. All right. Okay. So, we've

545
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,158
gotten our our seeds and our or our

546
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,558
clones ready. We're to the point where

547
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,919
we could transplant. What do you do?

548
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,079
Well, you got to choose your grow

549
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,799
medium.

550
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:38,158
Now, a grow medium is basically what

551
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,519
your plant goes into once it has roots

552
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,640
and you could start what's called the

553
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:46,158
vegetative period. Um, I would say the

554
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:50,000
most popular grow mediums are cocoa,

555
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,320
rock wall and and soil. Hydro ton is

556
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,960
also used in water culture. Water

557
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,399
culture is very difficult to master and

558
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,759
on a commercial scale I wouldn't

559
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,360
recommend it because there's lots of

560
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,038
problems that could happen. But water

561
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,759
culture is basically where you're

562
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:06,960
putting your plant plant's roots into

563
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:09,119
water with irration and there is no

564
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,319
medium. It's almost like a a completely

565
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,839
mediumless

566
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:15,359
growth. All right. So, we're at the veg

567
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,158
period. I took a lot of time to get

568
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:22,000
here. So, the veg period. The veg period

569
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,000
is where you're focusing on your uh

570
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,079
leaves and your root growth. I like to

571
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,038
think of that philosophically. I have a

572
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,918
plant. It has leaves. It has roots. It

573
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,919
has buds. Buds aren't growing yet. So, I

574
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,840
like to focus on growing roots and

575
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,200
leaves at this point. Um, so at this

576
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,119
point, I should probably introduce

577
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,480
something that's very important. Do you

578
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:46,798
guys know about photo period?

579
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,798
No, of course not. We've never grown

580
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:55,119
pop. So, the photo period for cannabis,

581
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:58,720
it it basically you control when the

582
00:23:55,119 --> 00:24:01,839
plant grows buds or not. When you have a

583
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,798
pot plant in 18 hours of light or more,

584
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:08,000
it'll grow vegetatively. It'll grow uh

585
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,679
leaves forever. You'll never have buds.

586
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,440
But when you switch the lighting period

587
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,600
to 12 hours a day, it'll initiate bud

588
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,400
production. Now, once you go into that

589
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:21,278
flowering period, it's about 3 weeks

590
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,759
before you start to see flowers grow in

591
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,038
the plant. Let me show you guys a

592
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:26,720
picture. So, this is what a female

593
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,599
flower looks like. Like I said, it takes

594
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,600
about 2 to 3 weeks to initiate once

595
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,519
you've triggered the photo period to 12

596
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,879
hours a day. So, you have your plants,

597
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,359
you're growing them, you change your

598
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,640
photo period to 12 hours a day, and you

599
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,639
start to develop female flowers.

600
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,880
Now tricoms really are where it's at,

601
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:52,000
right? We're the whole point of growing

602
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,880
cannabis is to get tricoms. The tricoms

603
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,240
are the glands that contain the

604
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,039
canabonoids, the tarpen, all the things

605
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,558
we love, right? You like Bubba Kush. No,

606
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,158
actually you like Bubba Kush's

607
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:07,759
tricoms. That's what we're smoking. We

608
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:10,720
smoke, we vaporize, we consume tricoms.

609
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:13,759
Um, so when we grow, you could think of

610
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,960
yourself as a tricom farmer for some to

611
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:18,640
some

612
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,558
extent. This is a picture of the of the

613
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,679
underside of a leaf during flower. It's

614
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:25,599
it's a strain garlic. This is a strain

615
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,360
developed by Mel Frank who's a really

616
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,759
good friend of mine. Matter of fact, a

617
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,479
lot of these pictures I took from Mel

618
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,158
from his like huge database of 40 years.

619
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Uh, but you could see the tricom

620
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,240
production. and it gets really dense

621
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,440
about the fourth week of

622
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,919
flower. This is a strain that we

623
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,798
developed which we call snake eyes. It's

624
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,120
a hybrid of Bubba and OG Kush. You could

625
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,278
see the uh the tricom production here on

626
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:51,278
the

627
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,360
leaves. Really quick here, let me run

628
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,158
through the bud development. If you've

629
00:25:55,359 --> 00:26:01,599
never seen a cannabis plant grow, it's

630
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,520
it usually takes about 60 to 70 days

631
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:06,000
from the beginning of flower to the end.

632
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:09,119
So, there's a 70-day period where you're

633
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,440
growing buds, growing tricoms. So, I'm

634
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:15,079
going to quickly run through what that

635
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:19,120
looks like. This is about 2 to 3

636
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:19,119
weeks. That's about 4

637
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:25,759
weeks, 4 and a

638
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:28,158
half, and 8 weeks. So, this is a plant

639
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:31,200
that's about ready to harvest. Um, this

640
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:35,840
is our Bubba Skywalker. This is a very

641
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,840
very heavyduty uh pre98

642
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:41,678
baba. This is

643
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:44,439
garlic. Okay. Now, one of the questions

644
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:48,080
I get often is how do you know when to

645
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:51,038
harvest? Well, one way is to look at the

646
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,960
actual tricoms with a microscope and you

647
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,679
start to see the color changing from

648
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,798
clear to opaque and then it gets like a

649
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,278
little bit amber. Now, a lot of

650
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:04,240
literature was written in the 70s and

651
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:07,440
80s about amber tricoms being the point

652
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,159
at which you harvest, but a study that

653
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,558
Mel Frank did in the in the '9s kind of

654
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,919
put that to rest. Really indoors, what

655
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:19,440
you're looking for is about 50% opaque

656
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:22,320
and just a 10 5 to 10% amber. Once most

657
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,000
of the tricoms have gotten amber in

658
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,720
terms of potency, you've already passed

659
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,200
that period. So in in terms of how you

660
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,159
know when to harvest, you want to look

661
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,640
at the color of the tricoms or you just

662
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,960
also look at the plant itself and it

663
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,640
looks like it's ready. It's

664
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,558
done. All right. So now I'm just going

665
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,400
to give you guys some nug porn. These

666
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:47,480
are just pictures of flowers. This is

667
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,840
the very famous Girl Scout

668
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,679
cookies. Skunk number one again from

669
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:55,678
Dave Watson. On the right we have

670
00:27:51,679 --> 00:28:00,360
Mendescino Purple Cush. Very nice. Um,

671
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:02,880
it's like a Bubba Kush hybrid from

672
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:05,519
Mendescino. Uh, this was actually bred

673
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,200
by CSI Humble. If you guys know them,

674
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:11,278
they're do a very good

675
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,840
job. On the left, we have uh the Donna

676
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,839
OG, which is a strain we developed. Uh,

677
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:18,319
the Maui, which is a famous Hawaiian

678
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:22,879
strain.

679
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:26,240
the Phoenix OG. This is a 75% OG Kush,

680
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,240
25% Bubba

681
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:30,558
Hybrid. All right, so we've got through

682
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:33,519
flowering. Now we're at harvest.

683
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,599
Finally, we can harvest our flowers. Uh,

684
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:38,558
typically harvest time is about 60 to

685
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,240
70, sorry, it's about 60 to 70 days in

686
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:41,519
flowering. And at the end of that

687
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,759
period, you could harvest. In other

688
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,079
words, you're chopping the plants down.

689
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,240
Um, hang drying is a very popular

690
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,558
method, especially if you're a boutique

691
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,120
grower and you have a limited number of

692
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:56,440
plants. Hang drying, I think, in my

693
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:59,119
opinion, produces a superior product.

694
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,278
Machines trim very fast, but they don't

695
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,959
do a good as good of a job as humans.

696
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:04,919
Now, if you're looking at investing in

697
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,919
cultivation, this is an interesting

698
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:10,960
stat. The the trim labor, if you're hand

699
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,080
trimming, could count up to about 10% of

700
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,919
the cost of production.

701
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:17,839
So that might be something to think

702
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,399
about when you're deciding whether to go

703
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,759
boutique versus mass production.

704
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:25,199
Trimming is very

705
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:27,440
expensive. Okay. Curing and drying. So

706
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,360
once you've dried your flowers, you've

707
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,759
harvested them, now you got to cure

708
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,918
them. Curing is really the process of

709
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,480
like getting the chlorophyll levels down

710
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,038
in your plant so they're not so harsh.

711
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,000
And typically I like to cure for 3 to 4

712
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:45,038
weeks. And usually the edge is taken off

713
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,919
and your plants are nice and uh smooth

714
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:50,558
when you smoke them. Um, one thing to

715
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,559
notice about curing and drying that it's

716
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,798
a very difficult thing to do. It takes a

717
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,720
lot of expertise and labor. So if you're

718
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,158
getting into

719
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,960
cultivation, make sure you spend money

720
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:04,880
or effort finding someone who's very

721
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,880
passionate about curing and

722
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:11,278
drying. All right. So today extraction

723
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,839
is very very very popular and uh when

724
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:16,000
you have when you have a harvest you

725
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,759
have a lot of flowers that are buds that

726
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,839
you're going to sell but you have also a

727
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,079
good percentage of trim and you might be

728
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:25,199
wondering to do with the trim. So the

729
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:28,240
options for for processing nowadays are

730
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,558
hydrocarbon extraction, CO2 extraction

731
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,919
and water water extraction and rosin

732
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:36,918
which is a relatively new uh type of

733
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,159
extraction involving hydraulic

734
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:41,840
press. Uh today in California I would

735
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,640
argue the most popular type of

736
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:47,678
extraction is still hydrocarbon. You

737
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,000
guys know about BHO wax and shatter,

738
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,038
right? The reason it's popular, one,

739
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,599
it's very cheap, right? And it's easy to

740
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:59,839
do. You could, there's tons of

741
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:02,639
21-year-old young people going to liquor

742
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:05,119
stores, buying butane, and pressing it

743
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,440
through PVC and extracting their flowers

744
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,038
and trim. It's cheap, so it's it's hard

745
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,440
to compete with this really cheap

746
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:13,839
product. CO2 extraction is much cleaner

747
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,360
and safer, but it's more difficult to do

748
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:19,119
well. Um, water extraction is more of a

749
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,000
lost art, but there are a lot of good

750
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:25,759
water extractors. And rosin is another

751
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
way to uh extract, which is basically

752
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,720
taking a bud, taking your bud and

753
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,359
squishing it like a grape and letting

754
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,120
the the the

755
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:39,038
resin squirt out. So, all this

756
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:40,918
extraction that people have been doing,

757
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,759
they could have just been squishing the

758
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,278
bud and have a product just as good. So

759
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,398
anyway, look into Rossin. It's something

760
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:52,159
that's a little newer. Um, but it's a

761
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,158
very, very clean, solventless

762
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:58,158
product. I know it's a

763
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,398
lot. It's a lot. I wish I had about 8

764
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,240
hours to talk about it all. Now, this is

765
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,398
very important for California. If you're

766
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,359
a grower in California and you really

767
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:10,079
haven't been out of Cali, regulations

768
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:13,678
are coming. Uh, like I said, I operate

769
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,519
in Arizona also and Nevada.

770
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,840
Arizona is unregulated for the most

771
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,519
part, but Nevada is very strict. They're

772
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,480
testing for heavy metals. The

773
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:24,679
microbiologicals, miccotoxins,

774
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,200
pesticides, fungicides, canabonoids,

775
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,840
tarpen, a lot of the things you're doing

776
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,360
right now in your growroom will not

777
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:35,639
suffice in 2 3 years time. So, my advice

778
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:38,319
is to start looking into the

779
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:41,120
regulations. Think about heavy metals.

780
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:43,480
Think about fungicides, pesticides. What

781
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:46,558
are you doing now? Will it still be a

782
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:51,079
viable process in two years? It might

783
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:54,079
not be. So, state regulations very

784
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:57,359
important. Okay. All right. So, this is

785
00:32:54,079 --> 00:33:00,079
it. Now, I I I figured the uh the the

786
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:02,798
organization Women Grow uh was a great

787
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:05,439
time to introduce some very vintage pics

788
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:07,319
of women growing. So, this is uh once

789
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,320
again from my friend Mel Frank's

790
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:12,158
collection of of uh 40 years of

791
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:13,918
cultivation. So, I just I want to show

792
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,159
you guys some really interesting old

793
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,960
school vintage pics of women in action

794
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:22,480
growing cannabis. This is a 1977 Elorado

795
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:26,829
County, and this is a friend of Mel's

796
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,000
growing uh this massive sativa

797
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:31,158
[Music]

798
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,679
outdoors.

799
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:38,480
Wow. This is Grandma's Haze 2014. City

800
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:43,080
of LA. A beautiful woman growing in the

801
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:46,000
city of LA. 2014. I love urban

802
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:49,519
outdoor Afghan Nigerian back cross. This

803
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,558
was in New York City in 1982. It took

804
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,880
some serious coonus to grow in New York

805
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:54,879
in

806
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,839
1982. This is a critter barrier. This is

807
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,200
in Northern California, 1981. Um I don't

808
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,678
know the strain here. It looks like an

809
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,679
indica though.

810
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,000
And this is a harvest going down upstate

811
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,918
New York

812
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,599
1982. There was 500 pounds produced from

813
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,279
this

814
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:19,559
grow. So women have been growing for a

815
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,399
long time. Just wanted to give you guys

816
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:26,119
proof. And that's it. That's

817
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:28,480
it. Did I make it? Sorry if I took too

818
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:30,960
long. I had to rush a little bit. But

819
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,199
thank you very much for listening to me.

820
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,639
I know it was a lot of information. If

821
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,719
you have no idea what I was talking

822
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,878
about, buy me a drink and I'll talk for

823
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,878
a lot

824
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:45,199
longer. Uh, I think that's it.

825
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:48,159
Lisa, you need to say anything. Do you

826
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:51,519
want to stick around or do a Q&amp;A here or

827
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,280
after you? No, no. Q&amp;A. Let's do it. Do

828
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:55,440
you have the mic, guys? Tell us about

829
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,880
the soil.

830
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,838
My soil. Yeah. I actually used cocoa. I

831
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,400
well personally I created a synthetic

832
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:06,559
line so I don't have an organic line

833
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,559
that I use right now. I started running

834
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:13,358
organic. Okay. So um so I created a uh a

835
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,838
fertilizer line which I I call clay 9.

836
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:18,799
If you have a a a grow then you probably

837
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:21,119
know a lot more about uh fertilizer than

838
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,519
the average person. But basically our

839
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,480
line was created specifically for

840
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:28,559
commercial scale growers. So, a lot of

841
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,880
the products on the market nowadays are

842
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,639
geared towards boutique growers. So,

843
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,119
they're really complicated. You'll see

844
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,799
companies that have like 25 products.

845
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,440
And if you're a boutique grower that

846
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,039
really understands, it's fun cuz you're

847
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,880
adding a million different things. On

848
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,838
the commercial scale, it doesn't make a

849
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,838
lot of sense. So, we took that boutique

850
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:50,400
idea and condensed it down to a

851
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:52,880
commercial line and we sell directly to

852
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,800
growers. Our product isn't available on

853
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,039
hydro store shelves. So, if you're

854
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,560
interested in picking up our fertilizer,

855
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,320
you could call, you could just talk to

856
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,480
me at the end of the show and I could

857
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,320
give you some information.

858
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Hi. Hi. Thanks so much. This is really

859
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,079
great. Oh, thank you. I'm curious about

860
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,679
a spring grow uh to prepare ourselves.

861
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,119
When would be a good time to germinate?

862
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:16,879
Perhaps a new moon in June, July, or

863
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,880
what is the how many harvest we get? If

864
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,200
we wanted to do spring, a spring growth,

865
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,320
when should we start? Yeah, I mean you

866
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:27,679
can start I mean you can start veging as

867
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,240
early as like January, February indoors

868
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:32,879
and then bring it out in March, April,

869
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,959
March, but you have to be careful. You

870
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,720
might need supplemental lighting. So you

871
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,119
want to track the amount of daylight

872
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,759
hours of light you're getting. Some

873
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,000
strains are real specific and picky. If

874
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,000
you take a strain from indoors, it's

875
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,838
getting 18 hours of light and you bring

876
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,159
it outdoors and it's only getting 16

877
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,279
hours of light, it might start to

878
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:53,920
flower. So, you might want to use

879
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,000
supplemental lighting even outdoors

880
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,240
until you get to a point where you want

881
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
to flower. So, that's what I would

882
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,559
recommend. You could, but the point is

883
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
you could start to to veg indoors and

884
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,400
bring it out when you're ready, when

885
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
it's big enough.

886
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,358
Time for one more question. Sure. Hi.

887
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,760
Hey, how you doing? I just wanted to ask

888
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,838
a question on um just growing a variety

889
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,520
of strains. If you're growing a variety

890
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,358
of strains and you have a couple tents

891
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,838
to work with, do you recommend sticking

892
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,920
to like one var like one strain, one

893
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,480
particular tent as opposed to multiple

894
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,639
strains and one one tent? Uh it depends

895
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,079
on, you know, how how much you want to

896
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:34,239
work. So, I mean, I do a lot of

897
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,880
breeding, so I'll grow 200 different

898
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:38,879
varieties in one room, you know, but

899
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,480
it's a lot of work. So it just depends

900
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,640
on your workload, you know, and how much

901
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,480
you how want to dedicate. If you're

902
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,559
doing production and you're just trying

903
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,400
to sell the crop, do all the same

904
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,400
string. But if you're if you're looking

905
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,039
for like phenotypes, if you're doing a

906
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,639
selection, you want to run more strings.

907
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,679
So it depends on what you're trying to

908
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,679
do. Thank you. You're welcome.

Thank you. Oh, go ahead. Go ahead. Oh,

911
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,519
thank you guys. Any other questions?

912
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,720
Are we done? I think we're done. Okay.

913
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:14,719
All right. Thank you, David.

914
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,319
All right. That was great. I know I

915
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:19,799
learned a lot. Thank you very much. Oh,
