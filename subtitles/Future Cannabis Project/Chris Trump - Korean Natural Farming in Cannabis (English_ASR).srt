Eddie finalists with phantom farms at

3
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,839
Oregon here in the one log 1 log

4
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,480
dispensary we're at the regenerative

5
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,679
science of cannabis conference my name

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,980
is Chris Trump

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,980
I run a 700-acre macadamia nut farm on

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,299
the Big Island of Hawaii that we've

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:36,829
transitioned to 100% natural farming and

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:40,589
having all kinds of success we had a

11
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:43,350
profitable year last year that made up

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,059
for the 10 years before that more more

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,120
profitability than 10 years before that

14
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,709
so it's um it's something we're talking

15
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,409
about today we're talking about natural

16
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,090
farming and some of the some of the

17
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:56,308
problems people had some of the

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,600
questions people had one of the first

19
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:02,640
questions I got to talk about today was

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,189
how do you scale this for for commercial

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,439
operations and sitting with no one

22
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:11,728
better for for talking about that in

23
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:15,469
cannabis than my friend Eddie and for me

24
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:18,478
there are some definite dynamics to

25
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:21,359
doing natural farming you know in a

26
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:24,269
wheelbarrow versus doing it on a large

27
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,829
scale and I had some pretty significant

28
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:30,750
learning curves

29
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:33,929
I did a 90 thousand pound pile of IMO 3

30
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,840
and I had a rain event I had a week-long

31
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,299
rain event and I wasn't undercover and I

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,469
had to scramble to save the pile and

33
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,979
eventually I had to spread it in the

34
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:46,560
rain because it was I was gonna go I was

35
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,688
gonna get enough water saturation that I

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,140
wasn't going to be able to do any more

37
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:55,709
aerobic fermentation and so there's some

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,960
some physical kind of logistical

39
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,728
difficulties you can run into then

40
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,819
there's also kind of the learning curve

41
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:04,349
so I teach five-day classes to kind of

42
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:06,779
help people overcome a learning curve

43
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:09,689
and made videos but even still there's

44
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,789
nuance that you kind of have to be

45
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:15,158
willing to let the

46
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:17,108
says teach you a little bit so if you

47
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:20,199
can if you can get over having a failure

48
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:21,909
and not calling that the end but saying

49
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:23,560
that's part of the learning journey then

50
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:25,539
you're gonna have fun with it and you

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,628
will totally learn eventually because

52
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:32,739
it's like anything practice makes better

53
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:36,399
but um at even scaling natural farming

54
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:38,140
for your grow and your as far as

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,519
cannabis grows go you're pretty big

56
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:43,779
how's that been it's been awesome and to

57
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,908
relate to what you're saying about

58
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,479
making mistakes definitely you have to

59
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:51,098
make a lot of mistakes to scale up and

60
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,568
but yeah we're doing foliar a lot of

61
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:54,848
folding with the K and F it's working

62
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:57,518
super good you can see instant results

63
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,009
the plants are just standing up you know

64
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,569
the Leafs and everything and but yeah

65
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:03,340
like I would say you have to you just

66
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:04,628
have to make all the mistakes and it's a

67
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,329
journey and you just got to keep

68
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:08,798
cruising and and it's a it's you get to

69
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,569
learn a lot of things about yourself and

70
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:17,799
everyone else around you in the farm and

71
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:19,089
it's super awesome I love it I can't say

72
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:21,969
enough good things about it I mean it's

73
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,250
it's a it's just so awesome to not have

74
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:26,049
to deal with chemicals anymore and I

75
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:30,068
have to rely on store-bought products

76
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:31,569
and it's yeah yeah you were telling the

77
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:33,759
evaluator point gherkin

78
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:35,948
profiles changing what is that like yeah

79
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,228
so we've been on our indoor facility

80
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,489
full LEDs living soil beds we've been

81
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:42,060
hitting three to four percent Terps

82
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:45,189
every time which is pretty hard to do

83
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,280
for with salt fertilizers and we've hit

84
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:50,289
as high as seven percent Terps so and

85
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,769
then the weed itself is just a better

86
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:56,548
product it's more vibrant it's the aroma

87
00:03:53,769 --> 00:04:00,219
the yeah it's just really nice stuff so

88
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:03,729
yeah the issues of scaling and all of

89
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:07,688
that I would say you're better off

90
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:10,900
learning on a small experiment than

91
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:14,438
learning with something giant and you

92
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,658
know so I did a lot of added years of

93
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:19,228
playing with things and becoming really

94
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:23,288
proficient before I try the 90,000 pound

95
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:25,029
pile of IMO and it went it was going

96
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:26,589
perfectly other than an A

97
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:29,049
that I couldn't account for you know

98
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:32,769
would have been awesome so I would say

99
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:36,370
get your learning curve out with small

100
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:41,439
experiments rather than an entire farm

101
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:46,600
or some big expensive costly problem if

102
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:51,370
you mess up one of the another question

103
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,410
we got was people are encountering you

104
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,269
know they're they're starting off really

105
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,520
well and they're having to fall off and

106
00:04:55,269 --> 00:05:01,060
in kind of the effects of natural

107
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:03,370
farming you know I don't know who you

108
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,839
know is experiencing that but if that's

109
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,060
a question we're being asked that I

110
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:10,529
would say that probably has more to do

111
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:13,810
with an understanding of what it is and

112
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:17,679
then some something with the system

113
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:20,949
being off just because we've had so much

114
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,290
success and you know kind of across the

115
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:25,060
board and it's mostly people that have

116
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:29,050
taken the time to really get into it and

117
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:31,360
learn if you're you're trying to fully

118
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:35,139
do it with just online resource

119
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,300
especially IMO there's some nuance it's

120
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:38,860
kind of like baking you know learning to

121
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,350
make a souffle you could have the same

122
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,050
ingredients as a guy next to you and his

123
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:47,160
souffle it looks beautiful and Rises and

124
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:50,410
yours is like this flat mush pancake and

125
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:55,330
that has more to do with technique than

126
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:57,340
anything and so bacteria will will give

127
00:05:55,329 --> 00:06:00,089
you a boost initially and you'll have

128
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:03,189
fall-off whereas if you can get

129
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:05,619
diversity of microbial life fungi and

130
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:08,918
yeast in your soil you're gonna have

131
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,780
this kind of Perpetual climb to health

132
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:14,829
and production is that been your

133
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:16,689
experience I you know I have I've just

134
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:19,120
been seeing success so I have not seen

135
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:21,728
any any bust but yeah definitely with

136
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,259
the IMO's it's been it's been difficult

137
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:25,659
it's arduous for sure trying to figure

138
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:28,569
out how to be in the right place at the

139
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,979
right time and but like I said before

140
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:32,079
you know just making the mistakes and

141
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:35,050
learning from them and and just you know

142
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,099
rising up and so it eventually it'll

143
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,810
kick in and

144
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:42,160
it's all good yeah do you run into like

145
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,560
how do how do you know when when to

146
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,840
apply or like I was like when do you

147
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,180
apply it is something I want to know is

148
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,819
the transitioning ignorant farmer when

149
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:56,590
do you play how do you use it

150
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:58,899
my Mouser or I am both you'd say that

151
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:59,979
though after taking a five day class you

152
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:02,259
kind of were equipped with that

153
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,330
knowledge like you understood when I

154
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:06,879
needed to apply it how that whole system

155
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:09,699
works that the problem is the knowledge

156
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,459
available online is limited and or it's

157
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:15,819
hard to sift through and you know sorry

158
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:20,709
for that it's just it it's a lot of this

159
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:22,659
is difficult to learn remotely where

160
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:26,019
when you're feeling it and smelling it

161
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:29,610
and seen the nuance in person it's it's

162
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:32,889
just a little easier so that's difficult

163
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:35,710
that question though is one I got a lot

164
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:37,839
so I did this week will actually launch

165
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:39,159
an online class on the nutritive cycle

166
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,769
so it's kind of when to apply these

167
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,800
foliar applications depending on your

168
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:50,669
plant growth cycle natural farming Co

169
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:54,550
and but they getting things wrong is is

170
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:56,439
generally pretty easy to do and it's not

171
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:05,470
it's not a big deal if you're doing it

172
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:08,379
on on a small scale but yeah the risk is

173
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,840
greater a greater scale yeah the bigger

174
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:15,969
the bigger it is the the more you're

175
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:17,649
running into problems you know I started

176
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,510
watching his videos and doing all the

177
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:21,189
stuff and that's a great starting point

178
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:22,959
but as soon as I started you know

179
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:25,660
reading the literature I went to his

180
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,250
class I learned way more than I ever did

181
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,790
by watching the videos and trying it on

182
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,160
my own

183
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:33,788
so there's a lot more information out

184
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:37,479
there than just the videos and and that

185
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:39,370
said the the some people do little bits

186
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,200
and pieces of the natural farming system

187
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,529
and that's totally cool there's nothing

188
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,420
the the reality is this is just natural

189
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:48,549
farming isn't the answer it isn't like

190
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:50,110
the magic bullet you're not going to

191
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:51,969
have guaranteed

192
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,310
everything's gonna work out for you

193
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,070
financially if you play with natural

194
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:58,958
farming it's just there's it's an

195
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,660
elegant method to use the principles

196
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,509
that are already at work in nature and

197
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:08,740
so what you have in nature is just this

198
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:11,110
cool interconnectivity of light and

199
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,870
water and microbes and and soil

200
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:18,310
nutrients that the plant could take up

201
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:20,589
and that's that's special and you can

202
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:22,328
get into and access that a lot of

203
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,459
different ways you know there's their

204
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:27,129
systems all over the world we're passed

205
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:29,199
down knowledge has been applied

206
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:32,740
effectively because farmers are good

207
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,810
scientists basically and but natural

208
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,028
farming is an elegant method it's a way

209
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:39,639
to kind of take these principles of

210
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:43,088
nature in a kind of easy to access

211
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:47,370
package and make them applicable on your

212
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:50,170
farm one of the things people ask is how

213
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,909
how what if I'm gonna use just one part

214
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:53,769
I don't want to get into it or I already

215
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:57,250
have this thing I do what should I do

216
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:59,409
and I would say if you could wrap your

217
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,139
head just around I am a one and two I

218
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:04,659
Mateusz a great thing where you can put

219
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:06,879
it in some water and and get it on as a

220
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:08,639
soil drench or something that would be

221
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,820
awesome

222
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:15,429
maintenance solution is crazy easy if

223
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,949
you can overcome or get o hn or make

224
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:19,838
some it's just you can you don't have to

225
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:22,929
know anything you can just apply it once

226
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:27,339
a week and you'll have ad general health

227
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:28,809
and and production to your plants and

228
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:31,029
it's it's really simple you don't

229
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:33,039
there's not a whole set of processes

230
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:35,740
once you have those tools on the Shelf

231
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,899
fpj brown or fermented plant choose

232
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,320
brown rice vinegar and oriental herbal

233
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:44,350
nutrient on the shelf you can just spray

234
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,149
it on your plants any old time and get

235
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:50,199
the benefit from that you do that pretty

236
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:54,458
regularly right yes so we defo leo or

237
00:10:50,198 --> 00:10:58,870
once a week and then we stop in week for

238
00:10:54,458 --> 00:11:01,269
a flower and yeah it works killer yeah

239
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,769
super good do you think you could talk a

240
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:03,519
little bit about your experience with

241
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:06,399
the master

242
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,740
like the guys here going to learn from

243
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,740
his doctor faster Channel

244
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,778
I had the privilege of about the time on

245
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,700
our farm we had some events that caused

246
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:19,419
us to say hey what's going on in nature

247
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:21,250
with these benefits these things were

248
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:24,370
seen that happened that weren't

249
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:26,409
explained in conventional farming so we

250
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,820
were looking for answers we were willing

251
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:30,069
to kind of check what we knew at the

252
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,528
door because we had saw seen some things

253
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:35,350
that happened on our farm where there's

254
00:11:32,528 --> 00:11:39,580
health came when we left the land fallow

255
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:43,420
and so we started searching and about

256
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:46,889
that time a friend of mine David Fortas

257
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:50,889
got a grant and brought Master Choa to

258
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:52,929
Kohala a little tiny town in on the Big

259
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:55,208
Island of Hawaii so I feel really

260
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:57,879
grateful it's part of where I share

261
00:11:55,208 --> 00:12:00,699
knowledge because I literally was

262
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:03,639
farming in a tiny rural town in Hawaii

263
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,680
and this dude from Korea decided this

264
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,419
was the place that he was gonna land and

265
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:11,739
this knowledge was gonna get first kind

266
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:14,250
of transferred into English and so I'm

267
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,139
super grateful for that and hanging out

268
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:21,129
initially Master Choa did a lot of

269
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:25,028
teaching with his daughter Gian Cho and

270
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:28,028
she she was really good at translating

271
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:30,309
into practical she doesn't work with

272
00:12:28,028 --> 00:12:33,669
them anymore but in the beginning that

273
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:39,429
was really helpful to kind of master Cho

274
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:41,379
is he he saw chemical fertilizers coming

275
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:43,028
to Korea and he said I need to give

276
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:44,980
farmers another way this isn't gonna be

277
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:46,720
all good so there's kind of a little

278
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:52,028
foresight like this might not work out

279
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:54,610
so well and he made this system and it

280
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:59,409
came some from Japan studying with the

281
00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:00,909
doctor and enzyme theory and and there

282
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:03,189
was a lot of cool knowledge that was

283
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:05,740
passed down in Japan and then it came

284
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,570
some from having a dream and waking up

285
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,610
and trying it on a farm for years and

286
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:16,000
you know finding these methods are

287
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:17,230
effective and and a few other doctors he

288
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,860
studied

289
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:24,129
under in Japan and then some traditional

290
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:27,360
practices in Korea and combine them just

291
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:30,909
to kind of an elegant accessible method

292
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,560
hanging out with them is fun getting his

293
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:38,709
slap you if you do things right or wrong

294
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:40,859
so big big back smack and great non

295
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:43,960
politically correct jokes and

296
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,210
demonstrations to explain how nature

297
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,940
works so I don't usually tell those

298
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:52,800
because some were offensive to our

299
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:55,630
Western mindset but um he's um he's

300
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,519
somebody that has been beaten to death

301
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:59,289
for sharing natural farming knowledge

302
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,949
green government after the Korean War

303
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:05,620
was looking for communists and he was

304
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,960
sharing knowledge on farms with farmers

305
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,539
and that coming together and community

306
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,960
was a little taboo at that time and so

307
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:17,769
he he's paid costs for for sharing this

308
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:19,480
knowledge and he's continued to and you

309
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:23,230
know he taught me how to taste soil and

310
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,080
and no no the the nuance difference is

311
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:29,620
you know this is has good microbial

312
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,509
balance this is too high in nitrogen you

313
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:35,470
know this is doesn't have anything going

314
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:38,470
on and you know fun fun stuff so there's

315
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,480
some the the real beauty of natural

316
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,009
farming is it's an invitation to be able

317
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,480
to look at your plants and look at

318
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:45,309
nature and kind of understand what's

319
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,860
going on when you say you kind of have a

320
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:49,779
sense of like oh this is this is what my

321
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,050
plants need right now or I need to do

322
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:56,439
something has that grown for you

323
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:57,939
definitely yeah I I'm stoked when

324
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,400
actually with the day that we have to

325
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:03,580
foliar I'm always like I'll do it so I

326
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,529
love it you get to see kind of some of

327
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,270
what your plants mean you kind of see

328
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,759
their changes and their shifts that do

329
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:11,079
you feel like your observation is grown

330
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,850
as a farmer sure

331
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,650
and and to you know we're on we're on

332
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,360
cycles right so it's like pretty

333
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:18,309
repetitive you know it's repeatable

334
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,379
basically so you know we flip the lights

335
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:23,649
to flower and we know and you can see

336
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:25,480
you know you can see the changes so yeah

337
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,669
I got a chance to hang out with Master

338
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,980
Choa myself a couple months ago on the

339
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:30,779
Big Island and just nothing but respect

340
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,960
for those deaf

341
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:35,579
they're super nice you know they they've

342
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,080
brought in this thing they're bringing

343
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,759
it to the states and and they could

344
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,320
attract you trademarked or patented it

345
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:41,610
and they're they're not you know they're

346
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,520
they just want to share with everyone

347
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,320
which is which is very commendable you

348
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,360
know that's what it's all about just

349
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,890
trying to help each other out and you

350
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:55,320
know not trying to hit a home run off of

351
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:57,720
it yeah so it's a culture in natural

352
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,540
farming there's there's some giving and

353
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,490
ingratitude involved which i think is

354
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:06,179
pretty cool to perpetuate you know to

355
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:09,000
continue people wonder about like oh

356
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:13,199
what it was the best plant to use for my

357
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,259
fpj and you know and then they see you

358
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,629
know tropical situations they're using

359
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,639
papaya so they go down at a local

360
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:24,029
supermarket and buy a bunch of papayas

361
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,529
and make fpj and that's not really it

362
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:27,419
you're gonna run into problems with that

363
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:30,179
anyway that's something that's pretty

364
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:32,069
common and on the online kind of

365
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:35,389
information as people go in and buy and

366
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:38,010
pineapple or something for flavor and

367
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:41,009
the problem is those fruits are all

368
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:43,139
bleach washed and and really the only

369
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:45,539
microbial life you have on them is gonna

370
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,279
be what the guy who put it on the

371
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,409
shelves had on his hand or what you had

372
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,829
on your hands when you're making fpj and

373
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:54,719
and so people get these blooms of weird

374
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,720
stuff happening on the surface the F

375
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,570
PJ's and I usually know oh do you you

376
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,920
know you store-bought fruit I'm assuming

377
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,519
that you don't grow bananas in

378
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:07,289
Washington and and there's so one of the

379
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,680
keys in natural farming is this can be

380
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:13,079
really inexpensive I really can because

381
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:17,210
of the amounts you use and using the

382
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:20,069
right amount at the right time but the

383
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:22,740
the things to use for some of these

384
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:25,409
nutrients are stuff that's wild in your

385
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,200
area and you really got to turn your

386
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,779
your sight on so to speak it's gonna be

387
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,279
a bit of a mental shift more than

388
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:34,440
anything because you got to drive down

389
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,170
the street or walk in your local woods

390
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,750
or or go you know in your neighborhood

391
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:41,580
and you look for these plants that you

392
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,819
basically have overlooked your whole

393
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:47,398
life you know ivy or ice plant

394
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:49,798
or you know lemongrass all these things

395
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:51,058
that just grow everywhere nobody ever

396
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:54,509
takes care of them they're always

397
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:58,168
healthy and thriving and vibrant and new

398
00:17:54,509 --> 00:18:00,778
shoots and and those actually are plants

399
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:03,179
that are getting complete nutrients from

400
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:06,690
their soil they're good at harvesting

401
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:09,330
nutrients they also are full of plant

402
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,850
growth hormone so why do why do we put

403
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:14,129
kelp on our farms you know why do we buy

404
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:17,308
kelp products well because kelp is this

405
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,049
extremely vibrant fast-growing strong

406
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:22,230
plan it's one of the fastest growing

407
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:24,960
plants in nature it's full of beneficial

408
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,269
plant growth growth hormone and minor

409
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,190
minerals from the ocean and so you take

410
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:31,919
these plants that are growing and

411
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,298
thriving around you that are taking up

412
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,269
nutrients really well they're gonna be

413
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:38,339
packed with nutrients and they grow so

414
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:40,798
well in part because they have these

415
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:44,459
these strengths these beneficial plant

416
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,589
these beneficial bio chemicals with that

417
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,850
your plant once you micronized it

418
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:49,288
through fermentation your plants

419
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:51,839
actually gonna benefit from these

420
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:54,329
complex foods that we don't even know

421
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,699
the bottom of we don't know all the

422
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:59,788
reasons all these things are our food

423
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,409
for plants and and taken up so so kind

424
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:03,210
of cruise down through your neighborhood

425
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:05,610
and and look for the things that are

426
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,829
free you know the thing that nobody's

427
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:10,229
gonna care if you whack you know hundred

428
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:11,908
pounds of that because nobody even

429
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,009
realizes it's there it's just always

430
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:15,929
growing and healthy and that's gonna

431
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:19,429
actually probably serve you a lot better

432
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:23,038
than a papaya from a local food

433
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:25,019
supermarket might even be able to create

434
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,778
some jobs by harvesting some of that

435
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:35,308
stuff been doing like you know fire you

436
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:36,960
know yeah blackberry shoots the old

437
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:39,298
blackberries are gonna have big gnarly

438
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,759
thorns you probably don't want to mash

439
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:44,278
on that but in the spring you see all

440
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:48,169
the blackberry shoots shoot up that's

441
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:50,700
all that's got a entire plant energy and

442
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:52,590
beneficial biochem most chemicals being

443
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:56,039
forced into it and you can just whack

444
00:19:52,589 --> 00:20:00,480
all that and straight benefit from your

445
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:03,809
your your local resource that's free why

446
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,940
buy it when nature is literally this

447
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:07,500
plant has stored all the nutrients it

448
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,440
can collect and shot it into these

449
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,750
shoots for you to get ready to harvest

450
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,230
and yeah you're dancing you're ready to

451
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,710
go get the the blackberry shoots yeah

452
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,690
man

453
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,690
what were questions you would ask me

454
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,299
yeah I mean I so we started off just

455
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,950
doing FP J's and we were like dude we're

456
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:33,480
Korean natural farming this is awesome

457
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,690
like don't look at the plants and crush

458
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,130
it

459
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,320
you know we'd totally thought we were

460
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,210
doing it but I wish I would have talked

461
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,339
to you and you and been like yeah that's

462
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,240
that's like the stepping stone you know

463
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:44,789
that's just the beginning

464
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,740
yeah so but I mean like I said we made

465
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:48,720
all the mistakes and cruised crews

466
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,029
through it and you know now we're now

467
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,799
we're crushing it so and you were I mean

468
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:54,629
as far as farming you were there was

469
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,680
some difficult years right yeah

470
00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:00,150
definitely

471
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,860
for sure and so where are you guys it's

472
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,509
good I mean so like an Oregon right now

473
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:05,609
if you if you're if you're if you're

474
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:07,109
surviving you're crushing it and that's

475
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:09,479
where we're at right now so we're like

476
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:10,889
barely getting by but yeah it's it is

477
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,049
what it is the organ markets is so

478
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,870
docile the price drop you know hit the

479
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:17,250
bottom and but you know thank God for

480
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:18,689
the Korea natural farming because if we

481
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,660
were you know buying all these store

482
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:25,370
inputs still we'd be probably not in

483
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:30,450
business you know so yeah I'm not a

484
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:33,000
cannabis farmer just a farmer of you

485
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:35,670
know tree crops and I am a market garden

486
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,500
in Boise Idaho right now but that's the

487
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,470
farmers plight kind of all over the

488
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:43,160
world you know it's not it's not just

489
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:47,970
here and it's not just cannabis so I

490
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:50,340
hope that this knowledge is actually

491
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:54,690
like hey there's a profitable way to

492
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:56,220
farm and you don't have to bleed money

493
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,930
until you go out of business to be

494
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,569
organic

495
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:03,960
here's a solution that where you can

496
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:06,960
have steady yields and a really healthy

497
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,548
crop so I hope for my kids that our food

498
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,829
system shifts and changes that there

499
00:22:09,548 --> 00:22:15,819
able to buy from the low street local

500
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:17,829
grocery store real you know medicine

501
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:20,859
food you know food that's really helping

502
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:24,699
their body and you know making them run

503
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:27,579
fast because right now some of the stuff

504
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,308
we're facing as far as human health is a

505
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:32,609
direct result of our farming system and

506
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:35,950
I think that can shift I hope we can and

507
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:38,798
and and I hope that there's hope in this

508
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:44,139
story for farmers that are struggling

509
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:51,569
with their with their bottom line maybe

510
00:22:44,138 --> 00:22:56,048
in like the fermentation and digestion

511
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:58,358
my translation of the new tree is better

512
00:22:56,048 --> 00:23:01,118
for the plant and why petrochemicals

513
00:22:58,358 --> 00:23:03,128
cause these problems yeah so I mean with

514
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:05,980
chemicals you're you're you're killing

515
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:07,089
your microbiology and so that's not what

516
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,788
we're trying to do here we're trying to

517
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:11,829
nurture and harness microbiology and so

518
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:15,450
you gotta you can't use any chemicals

519
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:18,189
cuz you're just you're going backwards

520
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:25,869
yeah I used to wear like hazmat suits

521
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:29,200
for your your sprays right and that's my

522
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:30,878
decides insecticides fungicides and yeah

523
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,580
you had to wear a mask and a Tyvek suit

524
00:23:30,878 --> 00:23:35,618
and it was horrible you know and but

525
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:37,358
that was really like that was how was it

526
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:38,678
presented to us it was like this is how

527
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:40,449
you get rid of powdery mildew you have

528
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,950
to spray you eagle 20 you know you have

529
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,798
mites you have to spray of it you know

530
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,298
and it's a quick fix and and that's you

531
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,798
know KNF isn't like that you have to

532
00:23:46,298 --> 00:23:51,308
have fortitude you have to build it up

533
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,599
and and so it's not just a quick shot

534
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:57,398
you know for shot in the pan or whatever

535
00:23:52,599 --> 00:24:00,158
yeah and plans in a system where they're

536
00:23:57,398 --> 00:24:03,579
getting through biochemical

537
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,409
communication with microbes they're

538
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:08,259
getting the nutrients they're demanding

539
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:12,070
and needing when they need it and as a

540
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:14,710
result plan in its cell walls and will

541
00:24:12,069 --> 00:24:16,450
create complete proteins it is the last

542
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,759
thing a bug wants to eat because the

543
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:22,028
amount of energy to deal with that cell

544
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:23,339
wall is so difficult they they're

545
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:26,160
they're not going to

546
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:29,039
you make a bunch of babies and and

547
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,660
thrive because they're there no they

548
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,460
don't have a good food source they have

549
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,410
a difficult food source it's like

550
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,160
dropping somebody off in the Alps and

551
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:40,110
saying here build a family you know it's

552
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:43,290
it's going to be hard and and so when

553
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:47,399
these plants are able to create complete

554
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:53,069
nutrients they're able to have their own

555
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:55,590
self defense against bugs etc and you

556
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:57,629
know some some people are are using

557
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:59,459
chemical fertilizer and they're like I

558
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:04,410
want to make a shift there's a big risk

559
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:09,509
and you could even just add in an IMO or

560
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:11,700
an lab2 what you're doing you want to do

561
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:13,160
it well you know just willy-nilly with

562
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,480
this stuff and you'll make something

563
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,300
funky and it won't really help you when

564
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:22,079
you grow but doing something well in

565
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:24,839
conjunction with some chemical nutrients

566
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,730
you can actually get crazy results

567
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:29,759
because the only thing that make those

568
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,370
chemical nutrients totally available to

569
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,440
your plants are microbes plants can

570
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:37,469
thrive in a vacuum so even if you are

571
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,710
growing with chemical fertilizer you are

572
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:43,799
already relying on microbe microbial

573
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,710
life to help your roots uptake those

574
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:49,799
nutrients and bringing in some more

575
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:53,970
microbial life will only help with your

576
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:59,009
yields and your general profitability so

577
00:25:53,970 --> 00:26:02,940
yeah I think yeah farming stuff yeah

578
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:05,849
it's some and it's yeah and you guys I

579
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:11,190
mean we we farm for a dollar 25 a pound

580
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:14,189
in our product yeah macadamia nuts but

581
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,019
um no it's it's a calling and and it's

582
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:19,259
it's wonderful like the gratitude you

583
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:21,869
can have to be able to play in soil and

584
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:23,759
with nature and just a beauty that

585
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:26,250
exists in the whole process

586
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,980
I think approaching that with gratitude

587
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,230
is part of what natural farming is that

588
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,120
there are some things we didn't create

589
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:36,150
you know we're not we're not creating

590
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,759
this beautiful symphony of

591
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:41,759
activity in soil and microbial life and

592
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:45,240
and light and photosynthesis and you

593
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:48,390
know all this cohesive you know energy

594
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,859
we're just benefiting from it and you

595
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,810
know whatever it is you're growing and

596
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:53,699
so I think there's a great deal of

597
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:57,829
thankfulness we can have as we

598
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:11,890
approached nature and the gift of days

599
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:11,889
