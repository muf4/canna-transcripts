1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,359
powers destined powers is known as

2
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:14,990
future 4200 sweet future 4200 calm and

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:18,509
on Instagram he's one of the biggest

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:24,750
proponents of open sourcing he's created

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:26,910
a huge forum and well he's actually a

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:34,130
gang leader it's called the good life

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:36,929
gang and it's just a way to open up

8
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,329
different networking opportunities they

9
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:42,119
put on different networking events and

10
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,840
different different cities we've done

11
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,519
over here inhalation extraction mostly

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,020
extraction but some cultivation as well

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,559
and they certainly move like towards

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,719
other other parts of the head again like

15
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:57,299
hemp is becoming a big focus on that

16
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,670
stuff as well but it started from this

17
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:02,549
dude going around and like paying

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,219
consultants to teach teach him something

19
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:07,920
and getting the SOP for that specific

20
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:10,368
thing and then and then he just loaded

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,629
up his website is a treasure trove of

22
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:16,799
kind of the history of how people have

23
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:18,539
been extracting and it was and now all

24
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,670
these other people just upload their as

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,950
like you know he was doing he was doing

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,960
his own extraction Hughes you know it

27
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:30,600
was just that he he's a great market

28
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,908
kind of guy like well he worked he

29
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,890
worked for he worked at skunk farms for

30
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,570
a little while like so there there was a

31
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,290
connection there of this mentality from

32
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:42,500
like very wolf of opens you know this

33
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,820
dedication to open source and then like

34
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,069
Dustin came out of that school of

35
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:50,609
thought is for a little bit of influence

36
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:57,328
yeah and he he's actually completely

37
00:01:50,609 --> 00:02:00,328
changed the like he the website that he

38
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:04,649
produced was something that now it is

39
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:09,288
the resource for all all the cannabis

40
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:13,090
extractors all the big names and now

41
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:17,609
lots of large-scale CBD companies

42
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,989
and you know big shiny china

43
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,830
manufacturers of equipment are all just

44
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:26,500
getting in there and I mean there's

45
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,239
advertisement going on personally but

46
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,889
it's not an advertised website he's not

47
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,700
taking money off of it it's just this

48
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:35,949
just treasure trove of people just

49
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:41,259
talking about ideas unedited unedited

50
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:43,298
and like sure he catches plenty of flack

51
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:45,219
for the things that he puts out and he

52
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:47,379
tries to promote businesses as he knows

53
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:51,519
that they're legitimate and if things

54
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:53,739
don't work out he has to take the brunt

55
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,719
of those things and by putting himself

56
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:59,560
out there it's just it's been a noble

57
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:02,650
thing and how he how he has given this

58
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,890
information to so many people and I'm

59
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,269
like yes take a beatin from time to time

60
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:09,339
give you something that you came across

61
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:14,439
on that site the past month that you

62
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:18,099
forwarded to him we were maybe Delta ten

63
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:22,900
yeah yeah Delta ten stuff Delta time THC

64
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:27,388
there's now a huge thread regarding that

65
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:30,310
and Delta live when we had a fun little

66
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:40,379
fort aid a little for a layman's

67
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:42,969
background so depending it specifically

68
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,909
they're all everybody's different and

69
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:51,098
I'll all have their own special ways of

70
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:54,159
effective but depending on where or how

71
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:56,709
the different pieces of the molecule are

72
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,340
laid out you you know the difference

73
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:02,709
between THC delta 9 and THC a is THC a

74
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:08,098
has a carbolic acid molecule in its tail

75
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:11,259
and no boxer group carboxyl group and in

76
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:13,089
another thing there's Delta eight THC

77
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:16,839
which has gotten really popular with the

78
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:19,389
water clear trend and people would you

79
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,639
know they would throw a bunch of carbon

80
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,259
and some acids and stuff into their

81
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,120
boiling flask and then they'd start

82
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:26,529
distilling it and it's coming out

83
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,740
beautiful water

84
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:32,289
here they sent test results early to

85
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,569
send testing labs and then it's yeah

86
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:39,340
like very low percentage of Delta 9 THC

87
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:41,889
eventually we started they got standards

88
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:43,810
for Delta 88 see then started

89
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,790
quantifying that there's more THC in

90
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:51,089
this that there is but then there's

91
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:55,540
still a little missing piece that like

92
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:57,969
you'd see you know 60 to 70 80 percent

93
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:02,280
cannabinoids and this water clear stuff

94
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,280
that you know is all cannabinoids and

95
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:08,640
there's plenty of isomers and stereo

96
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:12,610
isomers of THC and these are things that

97
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,168
happen through different reaction their

98
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,360
reactions that happen through heating

99
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:20,199
and the presence of acids and bases and

100
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,569
given the different different

101
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,370
environmental things or what was sprayed

102
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:27,459
on those those that that can actually be

103
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:31,180
a big indicator in what's happening into

104
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:33,489
the reactions as well so so go about all

105
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,620
that distillation method we're like you

106
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,228
put stuff in a pot it boils at different

107
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,180
temperatures and all that well throw

108
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:42,310
catalyst in that pot that you don't know

109
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,709
is there like you know people spray it

110
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,060
put sulfur on their plants or people you

111
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:48,668
know certain things get sprayed on

112
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,759
plants and when you concentrate that

113
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:54,909
thing in a hot flask under vacuum where

114
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,959
fires and fire attack yeah there's a

115
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,810
whole bunch of ways you could do that

116
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:02,620
but to go back to Delta 10 Delta 10 is

117
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:08,800
simply an unknown type of THC that until

118
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:11,680
recently was it is yes in different

119
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,350
income in different ways they affect all

120
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,519
three of those can affect a single

121
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,520
person completely
