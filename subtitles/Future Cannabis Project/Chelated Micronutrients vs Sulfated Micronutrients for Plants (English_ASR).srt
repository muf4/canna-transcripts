2
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:15,359
in working in with nutrients there's

3
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:17,939
been quite a change over the last

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,679
probably 30 years and it's is getting to

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,980
be quite a long time ago where almost

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,920
all micronutrients were sulfated micros

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:30,300
he had iron sulfate copper sulfate

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,250
magnesium sulfate zinc sulfate over the

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,109
years they gradually been changing more

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:40,259
into key Lakes and key lates are you use

11
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:43,019
an element that actually grasps on to

12
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:46,079
the micronutrient and holds it and makes

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,840
it more available to the plant the

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,489
chelate essentially means claw and so

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,170
it's got a structure where the elements

16
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,659
you're trying to Kela are trying to hold

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,000
they're usually a micronutrient first

18
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,878
one to start was probably really iron

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,540
where that was used greatly it would

20
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:10,250
latch on to the to the iron and it keeps

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,500
it more available to the plant where the

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,780
sulfated ones would change more by pH

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,170
what was available and what was not

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,329
available would wash out more so where

25
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,409
the chelated ones tend to hang around a

26
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:27,599
lot longer so you will find these days

27
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,640
that almost all your micronutrients now

28
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,009
are being that are being used are pretty

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,478
much key lights they are a number there

30
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,780
are a number of different types of

31
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,890
chelate some that allow the the

32
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,189
micronutrient to be available at a

33
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,659
higher pH or a lower pH

34
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:45,298
which is also one of the changes that

35
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,700
have come along over this period of time

36
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,100
back when there were mostly sulfates

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,770
most of the pH is that people look to

38
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:57,269
grow at we're much closer to a pH of

39
00:01:52,769 --> 00:02:00,060
seven so you might look at your pH to be

40
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:03,118
growing out would be a six six to a 7 3

41
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,030
or 7 4 and as we've gradually gone more

42
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,500
and more into key lights we find that

43
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,140
the key lights are much more available

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,810
when you're getting down to 6 or

45
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:17,129
slightly below 6 so we tend to then

46
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:21,330
put our growing ranges for PHS you know

47
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:23,549
maybe 5 5 to 6 5 or 6 4 in that kind of

48
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,290
a range and if you're a little bit up or

49
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,939
below that thing I don't think you're

50
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:31,769
going to find a real problem with it

51
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:34,409
it's something to keep track of because

52
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:36,239
as you're watching it it will tend to

53
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:38,519
wander in a certain direction and The

54
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,060
Closer that you know where you want it

55
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,620
to change

56
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,129
then you're quicker you start your

57
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,060
change most people that are producing

58
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:47,669
nutrients wouldn't be doing their own

59
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,930
chelation that would be the just that's

60
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:54,179
a total industry on its own we're

61
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:59,180
manufacturing manufacturing the base

62
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,180
elements yeah so they're sourcing oh yes

63
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,539
yeah yeah that's what it this is what's

64
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:10,859
so crazy about and how about nutrients

65
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:13,469
is just there they're just there's

66
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,829
there's you're paying for so much water

67
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:20,530
yeah I mean it's not all that difficult

68
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:34,020
to manufacture your own your nutrients

69
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:34,020
