1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:07,259
so you have a farm up in Santa Barbara

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:11,669
yes yes mr. Knights guy LLC is our farm

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,859
in Santa Barbara Santa Maria line you

4
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:15,179
know are you growing just cannabis

5
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:17,519
you're growing all sorts to vegetable

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,800
yes where were cannabis grower up there

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:25,289
we have seven acres under roof outs

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,320
we're doing it in large box marked 100

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:33,240
gallons two hundred gallon 260 okay

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:37,460
donar 60-gallon smart box we use you

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:40,620
know worm casting biochar peat moss

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:46,409
obviously some micro highs and stuff

13
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:48,149
makes it into the soil we found it's

14
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:50,849
something we've done in the past but

15
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,210
it's it'll be better soil this year than

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,879
it was last year because they got hot

17
00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:00,658
you know there's so as you probably know

18
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:03,210
when you first get raw biochar it has to

19
00:01:00,658 --> 00:01:05,039
be primed it has to be activated because

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,540
there's a thin sheen on the surface of

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,880
the char that's an organic material

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,930
that's partially blocking the binding

23
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:15,539
sites for the NPK so unless it's fully

24
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:20,520
activated you might expect it to be hot

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,890
but if the char is is activated its

26
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,658
prepared that eliminates that problem

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,280
entirely so I think you probably see

28
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,350
this year or maybe even next year you'll

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,978
see it starts to see the benefit right

30
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:33,689
for sure so that's one of the value

31
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:35,340
propositions of char is it allows you to

32
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,700
be more efficient with your inputs

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,469
whether its water or nutrients we have

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,730
to be more efficient I mean that's kind

35
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:44,250
of one of the bottom lines of

36
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:48,060
regenerative farming model is be

37
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:53,010
efficient with your uh nutrients no

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:55,010
runoff yeah we had zero runoff you know

39
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:58,109
it's advantage of smart pots you know

40
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:01,380
and I'm a fan of letting it dry pretty

41
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:03,659
thoroughly so I mean we were only in

42
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,649
both size pots we are only needing to

43
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,179
feed once every five to seven days

44
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,189
that's kind of the beautiful thing of

45
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,750
this these cocoa media so if fiscally

46
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:16,019
got two cups of media here we've got a

47
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:21,169
more traditional mix peat perlite and

48
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:23,400
Koya and then these are pure cocoa

49
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:25,708
obviously we need we really should leave

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,450
the peat in the ground and this is again

51
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:29,489
more of a traditional propagate

52
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:33,149
condition if some people want but the

53
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:34,500
difference between we've got these two

54
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,930
right here have about a day's worth of

55
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,340
nutrient in these three if about four to

56
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,930
six weeks with the nutrients so we're

57
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,810
taking advantage of that ability of the

58
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,359
shark during a hold on a difference so

59
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,498
it creates this system where the plants

60
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:48,359
release exudates

61
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:50,628
out of their root structures signaling

62
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:53,998
the microbiology to mobilize nutrients

63
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:56,009
so instead of using salt based nutrients

64
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:56,968
I'm not saying you do but you know saw

65
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,949
based on the tree in feeder is

66
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,060
essentially forcing the plant to feed

67
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:02,938
correct

68
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,528
with osmotic pressure this way since

69
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:06,419
they're living systems the plants get

70
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:08,848
exactly what they want when they want it

71
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,908
how they want it that allows them to

72
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:13,108
more fully express their chemo type

73
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:15,028
whether it's the trip annoyed or

74
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,998
cannabinoid in these signatures we're

75
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,229
seeing a consistently boost of that

76
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:22,138
again because these systems are

77
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:25,768
optimized for efficiencies driven by the

78
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:27,778
plan not by the farmer so have you

79
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:33,239
noticed how you know note your salt

80
00:03:27,778 --> 00:03:35,098
nutrient mixes react with the biochar it

81
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,688
will read you will have to cut back on

82
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:37,639
your nutrient packages pretty

83
00:03:36,688 --> 00:03:39,199
dramatically

84
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,149
and that's the part of the savings as

85
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,829
part of the efficiencies right you know

86
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,830
consistently forty to fifty percent

87
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,560
we were actually we're down to about

88
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:55,280
twenty five percent at what people would

89
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:58,219
normally expect you know I'm not I'm a

90
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,250
fan of the less is more sometimes you

91
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:03,020
know yeah and I found that over years

92
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,889
and years of growing actually indoors

93
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:11,210
indoors is my expertise I did it for a

94
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:14,899
long time Santa Barbara's or first go

95
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:16,459
and a big big outdoor situation where

96
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,290
man permitted before you know it's a

97
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,798
weird spot a San Fernando Valley and

98
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:24,069
then I was also in Montana for a long

99
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:24,069
time

100
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,478
so on the my indoor shows I became a big

101
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,110
fan of Coco

102
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:38,529
specifically because Coco and the reason

103
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,449
for because is the lack of bugs in it

104
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:43,179
because it's sterilized day on our

105
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:46,629
degrees and it's worth the extra money

106
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:49,360
to debit sterilized oh yeah you know and

107
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:51,009
then you know yes I mean I've heard it

108
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,788
described a million times

109
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:57,009
you know Coco is like you know

110
00:04:53,788 --> 00:05:00,969
hydroponics for on training wheels yeah

111
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:02,830
but you know but I like it because

112
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,289
there's a buffer there there's room for

113
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:08,529
mistake you know growing in rock wool

114
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:11,560
for a long time you fail a pump you fail

115
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:12,819
a drip system it's overnight you have a

116
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,288
nightmare problem

117
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:17,110
not to mention rock was not a

118
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:18,519
sustainable material its extraction from

119
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,900
the planet it's just not a good idea

120
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:22,750
they're better solutions there are

121
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:26,709
better solutions and I mean Coco for me

122
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:29,829
was the solution because it just it was

123
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:32,859
alive number one but at the same time it

124
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:36,189
was sterile so it really allowed me to

125
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:39,729
monitor my you know pH balance my

126
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:41,889
feeding program you know yeah there's

127
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:48,329
some potassium in there but it doesn't

128
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:51,668
hurt me you know and it allowed me

129
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:55,779
you're training a crew right I mean I

130
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:57,728
mean let's face it we're we enjoy the

131
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:00,369
cannabis plant sometimes things get

132
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:02,949
forgot it provides a measure of

133
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,569
resilience in the practice and the great

134
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:06,038
practice which in general we want

135
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:08,050
climate resilience we want to have

136
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:10,509
flexibility in the system would like a

137
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,400
reed blowing in the wind doesn't break

138
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:13,750
you just modulate with your environment

139
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,418
around you and then you can dial it in

140
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,538
and and this obviously provides some

141
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:21,219
water retention capacity so this is long

142
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:23,800
and short fiber cocoa what we've done is

143
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,940
we bundled two different strands to

144
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,699
create to maximize air-filled porosity

145
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,680
and then added the biota we add the base

146
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,860
so the base is as I said we take the

147
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,480
char we inoculate it with beneficials at

148
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,689
the organic different packages and we

149
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:42,990
incubate it for a month out comes our

150
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:45,089
base and the amount of Base so do you

151
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,430
find with this you don't have to use

152
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:53,789
additives of the beneficial bacteria and

153
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:55,079
stuff it's already there you can all

154
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:58,170
it's going to do is boost the

155
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:01,680
acceleration of a biomass of chlorophyll

156
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,270
so it's not like it's bad but I don't

157
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,750
know if you get anything better out of

158
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:08,579
it

159
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:10,350
frankly yeah that's that's fascinating

160
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:13,519
that's fascinating I wouldn't have

161
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:15,990
considered using a biochar mixing it in

162
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,359
just because you're so conscious of

163
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,189
being sterile and inert yeah when you're

164
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:25,100
doing an indoor think it's an air

165
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:29,810
monitor we create this mix indoors

166
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,810
intentionally to eliminate pathogens

167
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:35,660
but couldn't you create something

168
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,600
outdoors where the beneficials

169
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,210
out-compete the pathogens you can't I

170
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,710
mean it's a pretty delicate system I'm

171
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:44,509
not sure I can actually modulate that

172
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:46,609
system I think in theory with ecological

173
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:48,170
theory yes but we're interested in

174
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,300
efficiency here we're interested in

175
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,310
creating mixes that can be scaled that

176
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,410
people can use I mean the these are

177
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,610
essentially climate smart soils that's

178
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,170
the narrative we're trying to describe

179
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,430
we need to adopt climate smart

180
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,250
technologies whether it's in

181
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,660
transportation like the Prius

182
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,490
regenerative farming all of us have to

183
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,410
activate climate smart technologies and

184
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,000
this is what this is this is bait draw

185
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,010
down this is based on atmospheric carbon

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,170
yeah unfortunately it's pretty hard to

187
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:16,069
transport you know a pallet of dirt and

188
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:18,439
a Prius yeah that's well so I was on the

189
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:20,529
previous design team literally I work

190
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:24,649
for Toyota before I started this company

191
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:27,199
and that took us a long time to dial in

192
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:30,769
but there will be a word there we're

193
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,569
working out on a hybrid truck I'm still

194
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:34,429
involved with toy-like once the Toyota

195
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,780
guy you never really leave it I work for

196
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,849
Google for a couple years like once at

197
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:39,949
Google are you always a Googler yeah I

198
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,420
mean the problem with problem with that

199
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,990
whole thing is you're gonna have to get

200
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:47,929
him to have a range of 700 miles and

201
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:51,799
until we hit that mark an electric truck

202
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:54,259
is just you know cuz I'm I'm the kind of

203
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,179
guy you know I'll have to run to Santa

204
00:08:54,259 --> 00:09:00,620
Barbara to Salinas and back in the day

205
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:02,149
and a 200 mile range 250 mile range will

206
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,210
leave me abandoned on the side of the

207
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:07,069
road one solution there is the fuel cell

208
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,980
you know Toyota has a fuel cell car

209
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,660
right now they're working MRI the next

210
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,670
generation it comes out in two years

211
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:15,829
instead of having a range of 250 miles

212
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:17,449
and have a range of 450 miles that's an

213
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,300
electric car you're just making the

214
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:24,140
electricity real time so they're testing

215
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:26,509
a fuel cell semi again giving you range

216
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:27,529
that's competitive with diesel but

217
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:29,120
that's what we have to do is be

218
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:30,069
competitive with witness with the

219
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,799
subcision fuel

220
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,420
right right absolutely and then and then

221
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,189
you're off to the races that's why I'm

222
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:40,000
stuck in a diesel truck right now I'm a

223
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:42,130
farmer what are some nutrients that

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,589
between the two of you you think farmers

225
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:46,750
don't pay enough attention to like in

226
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:49,389
terms of what their benefit is the plan

227
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:52,389
they kind of neglect I noticed it's

228
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:56,169
mostly silica it's what people leave out

229
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:58,389
of their the regimen you know it's

230
00:09:56,169 --> 00:10:02,379
mostly sick and everybody's familiar

231
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:04,659
with your NPK and your your two step or

232
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:08,679
three step you know a and B kind of

233
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:11,740
thing but I find that most of them have

234
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:14,708
no concept of the necessity of silica

235
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:17,769
just a little bit it only takes a little

236
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:21,369
bit protec it's an amazing product you

237
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:24,250
know I mean that's the number one thing

238
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,959
I see with most growers leaving out most

239
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,539
of them are familiar with beneficial

240
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:30,719
bacteria is most of them are familiar

241
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:34,689
with micro I'd say they're all over it

242
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,829
but they're leaving out the silica and

243
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:40,690
it's it's essential and what is the

244
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:44,049
effect when you you're deficient in

245
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,649
silica silica just it keeps your roots

246
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:47,679
cleaner

247
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:51,909
everything's picking up faster I mean

248
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,859
it's just it just helps everything and

249
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:55,838
you're able with that little bit of

250
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,629
silica because it's picking up so much

251
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,980
better even with the the micros and and

252
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:05,500
your beneficial bacteria is that like my

253
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:09,039
feeding program is a quarter of what

254
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,339
most people would think a quarter he's

255
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:14,860
saving 75% of his inputs if I optimize

256
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:16,930
the efficiency of this system with with

257
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,688
smart micro macro nutrient application

258
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:21,278
and living soils because I would say

259
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:23,588
that's one of the missing pieces I see

260
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,929
is there are the regenerative farmers

261
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:28,509
and then there are the salt based

262
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:30,519
farmers force feeding the plants as

263
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:33,490
opposed to activating microbiology to

264
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,409
deliver nutrients on the man I don't I

265
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,980
don't dislike salt based nutrient

266
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:38,259
programs

267
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,509
it's just 90 percent of the people that

268
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:41,490
I watch do it

269
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:43,649
over feed them they feed them to death

270
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:47,220
you know it's like they're they look

271
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:49,289
great through week seven or eight of you

272
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,310
know veg and then all of a sudden

273
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:55,019
they're burning tits they're you know

274
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:57,479
it's it just becomes horrible really

275
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:01,370
quickly and it's feeding them to death

276
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,029
it's loving them to death oh it's like

277
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,769
less is more

278
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:09,899
it's a former control system instead of

279
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:11,669
a biology control system right right you

280
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,769
want to activate the biology let's let's

281
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:15,750
find them in natural systems so you know

282
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:18,600
if you activate the biology get that

283
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:21,929
plant picking up its nutrients really

284
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,680
well and then use a feed program so

285
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:28,289
outdoors you know we did us some serious

286
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,929
tests on our soil to see what was in it

287
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:33,509
to begin with and what we can now leave

288
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:41,519
out of our feeding program what we had

289
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:42,720
to supplement later on so your your

290
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,329
plants in the ground

291
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,460
so yeah this year we're going into camp

292
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,000
and I got a lot to learn there cuz this

293
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,560
will be the first year row cropping it

294
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,580
directly into the ground you know we

295
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:58,529
have our soil test you know we have that

296
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:04,110
we will be using a salt based program

297
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:07,370
because it's efficient to feed but not

298
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,810
heavy dosages not getting carried away

299
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:13,409
we have seven strains that we're going

300
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:17,250
to be working this year on the hand side

301
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:17,789
on the hand side and you know going in

302
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,360
blind

303
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:22,028
I mean literally you know

304
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,548
I have found just like cannabis I expect

305
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:27,399
it to be just like cannabis the seed we

306
00:13:24,548 --> 00:13:29,769
got isn't necessarily the seed they

307
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:33,249
advertise what are some of the strains

308
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:36,759
you're exploring and why so I would have

309
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:39,159
to get my list out but basically I got

310
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:41,619
two strains out of the Colorado market

311
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:43,088
I got a strain out of Kentucky I got two

312
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:45,939
strains out of Oregon

313
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:49,089
we got a strain out of Spain and we got

314
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:53,469
a strain out of Israel they're all the

315
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:56,110
Mubarak's your farm is where so it's in

316
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,699
Santa Paula we have 60 acres we're

317
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:02,169
putting into the ground in Santa Paula

318
00:13:57,698 --> 00:14:06,578
Santa Paula just this side of Fillmore

319
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:11,828
in the Oxnard Valley Santa Rosa Santa

320
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:14,109
Paula Fillmore and so is the idea that

321
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:16,388
you have no idea what's going to respond

322
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,669
to that microclimate I have no idea

323
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:22,389
what's gonna respond so we're gonna try

324
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:24,759
or what the final tests are gonna be you

325
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:28,028
know with hemp we've got a maintain

326
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,298
that's ridiculous less than 0.3 right I

327
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:30,298
mean

328
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:40,948
yeah yeah it's this year we're growing

329
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:43,349
sixty acres and you had mentioned

330
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:46,389
biomimicry so like what are some

331
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:51,190
biomimicry concepts that are applied to

332
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:55,480
making soil well our case were by making

333
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:58,209
your by mimicking fire fire creates

334
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,420
biochar that's the natural mechanism to

335
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:05,138
regenerate soils so I have a question

336
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:07,360
can you a harvest biochar and help out

337
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:09,940
with like charcoal power plants and

338
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,419
stuff say more about that how would I

339
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:15,910
have what a harvest well you know in the

340
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:18,939
burning of charcoal you have you know

341
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:22,448
all of those carbon emissions that are

342
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:25,600
such a problem and if we could directly

343
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:31,240
harvest those back out because they're

344
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:34,509
not bad for growing you know like power

345
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,549
plants you know the things that are

346
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:39,149
coming off the smokestacks all of that

347
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:42,490
carbon and co2 that's being pumped

348
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:44,679
through the atmosphere you know how do

349
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,230
we go about harvesting that back well

350
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:49,448
I'm putting it directly into a soil and

351
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:54,159
there's a whole immersion industry

352
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:57,179
around direct air capture but you're

353
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,179
probably not yeah help yourself

354
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:04,849
you're probably going to use that carbon

355
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:13,730
not to create charcoal but to create

356
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:17,278
graphene batteries or roads right or

357
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:20,009
cement there's a bunch of emerging

358
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,438
industries that are going to repurpose

359
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:24,449
atmospheric carbon and do something

360
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:27,120
useful with it since you're rebranding a

361
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:29,099
problem molecule co2 into a solution

362
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,139
molecule whether it's for each other

363
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,110
bags whether it's for next-generation

364
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:36,839
cars I was just one of the thoughts I

365
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:40,019
had when I was playing with the with the

366
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:46,160
biochar for the first time this year was

367
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:49,070
I wonder you know because you know

368
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:53,569
because you know obviously fossil fuels

369
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:56,540
are with us for a while longer but if we

370
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,430
can figure out a way to make them not so

371
00:16:56,539 --> 00:17:00,379
dirty and reclaim some of that carbon

372
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:04,039
yep absolutely

373
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:05,890
put it into the growth cycle it's a

374
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:07,818
win-win

375
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:11,390
unfortunately what most people are now

376
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:14,690
doing with that captured co2 they're

377
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:20,329
injecting into old oil wells to get more

378
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:24,110
oil out right that's the big market

379
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:27,680
right now for co2 I could I can see that

380
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:29,329
I can see that you know it's just one of

381
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,850
the thoughts I was having you know I

382
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:34,639
mean I was just in a discussion where a

383
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:38,480
guy's figured out how to make plastics

384
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:42,290
out of seashells which I thought was

385
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:47,900
amazing so you have to stack some stacks

386
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:50,480
and stacks of oyster shells can you

387
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:54,050
imagine making biochar out of hemp

388
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,089
residue well why not why not I mean we

389
00:17:54,049 --> 00:18:00,799
have piles and piles and piles of stock

390
00:17:56,089 --> 00:18:04,009
right now that we can't do anything with

391
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,259
I mean we don't yet have the empar c't

392
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:12,019
right there's not the processing

393
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:14,930
infrastructure problems yeah but you

394
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:23,389
still left your main your main outputs

395
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:26,180
gonna basically be oil no we don't have

396
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:28,220
that infrastructure yet you know so I

397
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,500
mean much as we'd like to Bale up the

398
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:33,500
stock and ship it somewhere and make a

399
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:37,940
dollar off of that that we don't really

400
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:40,960
have anywhere here set up are you

401
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,870
allowed to compost it on site

402
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,410
and so do you have sort of some sort of

403
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:51,189
composting strategy so you know our plan

404
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:53,230
actually it'll be pretty much the same

405
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,870
thing we did with all of our our stock

406
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:58,539
this year off the cannabis garden just

407
00:18:55,869 --> 00:19:00,629
make a big pile light it on fire spread

408
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:04,480
those ashes and use it in our soil I

409
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:06,370
mean that's what we did so from a

410
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,490
biochar perspective would there be a way

411
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:12,789
to not light it on fire but to turn it

412
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,380
into biochar well it's not just carbon

413
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:17,230
though it's all these micronutrients as

414
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,930
well so the ash of a fire is all the

415
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:22,180
other nutrients besides carbon yeah it

416
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:25,539
becomes an awesome Pro - and just make

417
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:28,299
sure you do biochar as you heat it -

418
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:31,029
just before it does combust kind of like

419
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:33,490
you're not like bye we are almost making

420
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:36,700
it a pole yeah so this is here's a

421
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:38,799
diagram so this the axis here is

422
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,410
temperature this is the low temperature

423
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,500
this is high temperature the ideal

424
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:47,590
temperature is about 600 degrees see

425
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:51,579
where you create these highly irregular

426
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:54,339
surfaces with lots of surface area that

427
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:56,019
provide habitat for microbiology the

428
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:59,589
hotter it gets you get these ordered

429
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:01,119
sheets get graphene on this end it is

430
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:03,069
very irregular they're called fullerene

431
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,159
molecules and we think that's one of the

432
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:09,519
reasons why biochar is so stable because

433
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:12,519
of the irregular orientation of the

434
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,680
carbon rings themselves because the idea

435
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:19,089
I mean the idea is to like store carbon

436
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:21,820
in soils like draw it down and store it

437
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:23,470
and then do something useful with it and

438
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:25,129
designing the charcoal so it can be used

439
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,829
for Ag markets

440
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:30,490
but the first idea was just like this to

441
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:34,029
dry down carbon

442
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:36,140
not in the oil well but on the surface

443
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:37,990
well that's super cool that you're doing

444
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,100
firetruck thank you for doing that man

445
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:42,349
if there's any way we could help you

446
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:45,529
yeah well it's an experiment we did this

447
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:47,959
year the only thing I really found as a

448
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:52,038
problem this year is our soil was caught

449
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:55,009
you're like a soil chef so when you have

450
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:57,230
a recipe like what are you thinking

451
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:59,240
about as you build up a soil like you're

452
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,429
like okay I need this to give it air I

453
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,819
need this for the microbes I need this

454
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:10,940
for that like what's what goes into

455
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:12,980
creating a soil recipe so it's the

456
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,009
architecture of the soil to start with

457
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,929
the physics of the soil and it do what

458
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:20,240
it needs to do then it's the chemistry

459
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:24,110
the combined chemistry biology and you

460
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,019
optimize both of those for efficient

461
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:28,339
delivery of nutrients to plants I

462
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:31,730
actually have a question today that is

463
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:33,619
why did you leave paralyzed because we

464
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,750
feel like perlite in some ways is taking

465
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:37,808
up space where a root should be you

466
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,700
don't really need perlite you know

467
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:43,369
really helps with drainage you know and

468
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,400
getting that water to penetrate deep

469
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:48,469
into the soil because we have the short

470
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,048
and long fiber cocoa that really

471
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:55,279
provides that the air-filled porosity

472
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:55,869
you don't find it packs no no we really

473
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,250
don't

474
00:21:55,869 --> 00:22:02,089
in fact we would prefer people to use

475
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:04,909
these than these just because this is a

476
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:07,369
renewable resource right I mean I

477
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:11,090
understand the bare light thing that you

478
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:13,428
know I mean even we should if you'd be

479
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:16,308
interested we'd be happy to you know

480
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:18,950
support a trial so we could show you how

481
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:21,048
this actually works you'd be interested

482
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,610
well yeah it's somebody give me your

483
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:27,009
card we'll talk about it as soon as we

484
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:27,009
get the plant because I actually have

485
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:38,648
240 pots that we haven't 240 260 gallon

486
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:47,889
ups we haven't filled yet I haven't

487
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:50,378
purchased dirt for the hoop houses in

488
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:53,048
place I'm just stalled because I know my

489
00:22:50,378 --> 00:22:55,178
permit expires and you know I don't want

490
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:56,918
to invest in soil if I have no permit

491
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:58,690
kind of a tough spot because before you

492
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:01,320
could just do it because you're under

493
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:04,778
the radar yeah now that you've come out

494
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:07,048
you're not it's absolutely killing me

495
00:23:04,778 --> 00:23:09,398
it's making me regret yeah I can imagine

496
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:15,429
in this you can't turn back the clock

497
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:17,439
you can't turn back the clock my wife

498
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:19,570
called me out for going legal you know

499
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,179
for doing it it's just like it'll just

500
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:24,548
be a nightmare and she's right she's

501
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:32,259
absolutely right for going legal

502
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:35,319
oh yeah she is just like she saw the

503
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:37,899
people in charge you know she saw that

504
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:40,960
you know we went through so much effort

505
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:42,998
to get permitting and then I like gave

506
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:48,819
up you came from the traditional mark I

507
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:52,838
came I've been doing that since 1986 so

508
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:58,028
talk to me about screens from the past

509
00:23:52,838 --> 00:24:01,898
that you can't find a skunk wad true

510
00:23:58,028 --> 00:24:07,749
skunk one the golf-ball indica nobody

511
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:13,329
has it anymore that's that one

512
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:18,308
the original mando purple call falling

513
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:22,598
because what's gone you saw there you

514
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:25,079
saw it coming out of Mendocino Ukiah at

515
00:24:22,598 --> 00:24:25,079
that area

516
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:32,929
and it was just phenomenal just

517
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:35,210
absolutely phenomenal and it's gone you

518
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:39,590
know it disappeared in the early 90s

519
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:41,990
both ago both of those days the camp

520
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:44,928
raids were more effective than people

521
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:47,990
think they were I mean yeah a lot of

522
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:52,820
girls were left intact up there but a

523
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:58,308
lot of strains were lost a lot by just

524
00:24:52,819 --> 00:25:01,009
attrition or by by bulk by both

525
00:24:58,308 --> 00:25:03,109
crossbreeding the seeds you know

526
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:06,349
pollination that people didn't really

527
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:12,319
know where that pollen came from you

528
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:14,808
know we had some great sticky weed in

529
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:24,168
the late 80s early night where were you

530
00:25:14,808 --> 00:25:28,730
going to talk about the SMP okey so I

531
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:31,788
still have that train I've had it for 27

532
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:35,630
years continuously clone but what's the

533
00:25:31,788 --> 00:25:38,658
history of which it actually came in

534
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:41,480
through Point Mugu Naval Air Station in

535
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:44,630
a backpack from those old Navy SEALs

536
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,690
that we're working in Afghanistan that's

537
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:49,730
where it came that's where it came and

538
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:54,140
you got a cut and I got a cut I got a

539
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:58,069
bag of seeds directly out of there and

540
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:08,049
and what made that a standout because of

541
00:25:58,069 --> 00:26:11,859
our purely affect it is the original PK

542
00:26:08,048 --> 00:26:14,889
so sfv OG

543
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:19,779
its original name with pique you know

544
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:26,560
the pure coach and that is the original

545
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:30,129
FF s empty what's just a pain in the ass

546
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:33,579
to grow it was like an ivy plant it went

547
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:36,670
everywhere you know it was just compared

548
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:38,829
to like your Northern California indica

549
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:42,009
plants that were nice and in uniform and

550
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:44,829
bushy and you know grew up like this

551
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:47,740
this thing you switched it into in the

552
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:52,809
flower its initial stretch could be as

553
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:56,799
much as two or three feet in 11 12 14

554
00:26:52,809 --> 00:27:02,049
days like maintaining a light height on

555
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:05,529
those was just like wow you know super

556
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:07,599
hard you know and and your bud structure

557
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:09,670
was nowhere it's close together that's

558
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:12,490
the end of us out of Northern California

559
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:15,060
you know it would be like a bud and then

560
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:18,970
a blank spot for eight or nine inches

561
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:21,639
another bud and then it was like an ivy

562
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:24,549
plant just going everywhere so getting

563
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,550
that plant to respond properly and get a

564
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:30,789
tight bud structure what's just really

565
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:32,409
really a tough tough play you know it

566
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:35,349
still it

567
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:40,269
oh yeah oh yeah what is your farm called

568
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:42,909
you know so mr. nice guy LLC is is our

569
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:48,309
farm in Santa Barbara is licensed from

570
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:52,960
half-baked yeah Chappell is a brand

571
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:57,369
ambassador exactly exactly yeah but the

572
00:27:52,960 --> 00:28:02,019
soil building I'm a fan of worms kill

573
00:27:57,369 --> 00:28:05,169
those worms in your soil but but if

574
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:07,359
you're growing in pots release worming

575
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:10,390
your forms and into the pots right into

576
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,849
the box both red and night crawlers

577
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:17,140
night crawlers will go deep red will

578
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:20,469
stay on top and they just and in terms

579
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:22,450
of like are you constantly like I think

580
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,160
of kind of the moisture level and soil

581
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,960
like you want to keep it in a bend you

582
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,630
don't want it to get super dry and then

583
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,779
overwater it like keep going blowing

584
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:33,670
passes like the band that the micro

585
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:35,109
right they don't want to live in a swamp

586
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,800
that's for sure

587
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:42,909
that's for sure you know so you know I

588
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,700
don't water to run off it's too wet it's

589
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:50,159
too much

590
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:54,179
but like we watered our pots every 10 or

591
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:57,330
14 days all through the offseason just

592
00:28:54,179 --> 00:29:00,989
to keep the worms alive so the worms

593
00:28:57,329 --> 00:29:03,658
were doing their thing and breeding and

594
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:06,450
growing and so you're leaving the soil

595
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:08,369
in those pots and what are you doing to

596
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,308
build the soil back up are you doing

597
00:29:08,368 --> 00:29:13,558
anything or yes we turned it and letting

598
00:29:11,308 --> 00:29:16,589
the worms go letting the worms do their

599
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:18,839
thing like I said this year because of

600
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:21,418
the biochar I think because of the

601
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:25,378
biochar the soil was a little bit hot

602
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:27,419
deep in deep in the soil it's not

603
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:29,788
because of the biochar I mean I think

604
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:32,879
that as I said char needs to be

605
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:35,788
activated it takes a couple years so I

606
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:37,138
guarantee you that certainly next year

607
00:29:35,788 --> 00:29:39,298
you won't have that problem at all

608
00:29:37,138 --> 00:29:41,248
we don't have any problem whatsoever so

609
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:43,319
you know it may be the worm gas things

610
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:46,249
that we've added in there but the church

611
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:48,720
is just a little bit hot we were hot

612
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:52,319
we're on this has enough nutrients for

613
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:57,058
six weeks in it right here I mean this

614
00:29:52,319 --> 00:30:01,528
should be hot but it's not right so so

615
00:29:57,058 --> 00:30:03,388
that was my one complaint this well one

616
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:05,460
of my complaints is our soil it's hot

617
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:08,008
yeah we were understand you don't want a

618
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,710
hot soil no definitely don't that's a

619
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:13,480
that's that's inefficient and it creates

620
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:15,850
stress on the plants it's unnecessary

621
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,500
so I'm looking forward to this year

622
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:20,349
because I know what calm down

623
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:24,788
and I know those that live release a

624
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:26,740
worm you know how big a green Gretna

625
00:30:24,788 --> 00:30:30,369
door was the chart selfie you got was it

626
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:33,509
heterogeneous was it consistent you know

627
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:37,209
it's close to what we see here you know

628
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:39,548
maybe a little bit little bit thicker a

629
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,308
little bit coarser this is so you can

630
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:43,808
see it though this is really you can

631
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:47,220
feel it as well at the time we were

632
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:49,658
mixed in it was you know pretty awesome

633
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:54,538
you know I mean we're mixing an

634
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:57,039
old-school style with a bucket motor so

635
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:59,679
I'm just turning and turning and turning

636
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:02,558
and turning I love the fact you are

637
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,169
using worms because you're creating worm

638
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:10,450
castings so it's soy death to buy oh

639
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:14,139
that's ridiculous we just bought worms

640
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:15,788
and let them go and fed the hell out of

641
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:18,519
them and they do nothing but clean your

642
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:20,679
roots and take care of the soil and give

643
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:21,730
you love all in the soil you know so it

644
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:27,309
sounds like you've drank the kool-aid

645
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:30,130
around biomimicry natural but totally

646
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:32,048
make sense why waste the money right

647
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:34,480
waste of money plus you're really

648
00:31:32,048 --> 00:31:35,769
championing it over general farming you

649
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,048
know and then you get all those little

650
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:44,649
tunnels that the water can freeze down

651
00:31:38,048 --> 00:31:49,298
in and you know win-win-win air filled

652
00:31:44,648 --> 00:31:51,579
porosity right well it's super exciting

653
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:54,220
I joined the conversation thank you so

654
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:56,288
much for doing what you're doing thank

655
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,389
you thank you and I'll give you a call

656
00:31:56,288 --> 00:32:02,169
and we'll figure out how to get some

657
00:31:58,388 --> 00:32:05,379
soil up we really see this as kind of a

658
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:06,639
transition soil like farmers who are

659
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,559
doing really well you have a situation

660
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:12,699
where we can pick it up by the dump

661
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:14,740
truck load we don't it's either in super

662
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,960
sacks or in bags because that's made

663
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,509
indoors we don't like using dump trucks

664
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,039
I'll be honest with you for pathogens we

665
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:23,799
just really want to make sure you get a

666
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:28,889
clean soil but we have four yard super

667
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:28,889
sacks and those can be in a dump truck

668
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:35,680
so yeah I mean that's just how we had so

669
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:37,150
I'll delivered out there was dump trucks

670
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,000
came up we mixed it

671
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:42,700
we actually mixed outside I told you old

672
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,769
school style bucket loaders and you did

673
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:47,500
you see any pathogenic behavior later

674
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:52,119
because of that see that's what we're

675
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:55,930
trying to control for so it's hard

676
00:32:52,119 --> 00:33:00,489
outdoors it's really hard you know I've

677
00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:01,269
had I liked indoors I like the control

678
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:03,880
of indoors

679
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:07,240
I prefer indoor controlled environment

680
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:11,020
agriculture yes I like is a huge huge

681
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:13,000
opportunity I've been a fan I've been at

682
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:17,319
it for a long time I'm really good at it

683
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,289
I understand the problems in be honest

684
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:22,720
this year we struggled outdoor you know

685
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:25,389
a little bit little bit you can go

686
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,130
backwards can't you I mean even though

687
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:29,890
you've you're legal you can still pivot

688
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:32,260
from oh yeah well we're working on

689
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:35,050
getting indoors permitted we just

690
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:37,750
haven't been successful yet you know and

691
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:41,129
that's where I prefer to be you know

692
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:45,809
it's just I applied I applied I applied

693
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:48,760
so I actually have a volatile license

694
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:50,169

00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:00,130
risking city got a two and a half hours

699
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:03,309
north of Santa Barbara okay so sevens

700
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:08,200
yeah up there by building stuff yeah so

701
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:12,610
further north so we'll use that as our

702
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:14,589
processing distribution center our first

703
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:17,590
big permitted growth in Mata Santa

704
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:23,769
Barbara we're trying for permits in

705

Santa Paula San Fernando Valley

706
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:31,210
for indoor operations are you part of

707
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:36,960
any growing Association so you know I

708
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:43,659
work with Justin a little bit but no

709
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:46,148
stated independent so like Ryan Martinez

710
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:49,300
it was the Edgar for jungleboy he was my

711
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:52,179
best friend since 16 I'd laugh because I

712
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,599
hadn't particularly gentlemen it was

713
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:56,260
funny

718
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:11,619
give out aids very often when we're

719
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:13,210
judging weed so we walk in and I'm

720
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:17,530
standing there at the counter I'm like

721

is that and so is that she like looks at

723
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:27,789

stuff over there is kind of a beat but

727
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:35,769
these three right here those are a

728
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:38,679
pluses those are solid solid genetics

729
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:40,389
right there so like four months later

730
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:43,358
I'm in another conversation with a

731
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:45,480
friend and he's like oh yeah do you know

732
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,789
the head girl for jungle boy system I

733
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,858
know no idea it's like it's Ryan

734
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:53,369
Martinez I just started laughing I'm

735
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:57,039
like had to be one of five people I know

736
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:59,200
okay add to be that I grew up with he

737
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:02,019
was a big grower right here in Malibu

738
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:04,539
and he helped me develop my program back

739
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:07,838
when we were 18 years old we worked

740
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:11,190
together you know like you know screwing

741
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:14,858
up plants feeding him to death

742
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:18,250
live and learn right this iteration so

743
00:36:14,858 --> 00:36:21,309
it was so funny when I just died of

744
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:24,099
tears when and it just was like oh my

745
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:26,210

747
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,269
[Music]

748
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,870
right you had lost touch with him I'd

749
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:36,659
just yeah I've been in Montana growing

750
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:38,609
for seven years and you know he came up

751
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:41,909
actually when I set up my program in

752
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,960
Montana yeah cuz he was my best friend

753
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:46,529
that we just

754
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,050
they've gone gone our ways and doing our

755
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:51,810
thing and you know he got married and

756
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,820
had a kid and he was down here busy as

757
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:56,159
hell and I was up there just busy as

758
00:36:53,820 --> 00:37:00,420
hell you know just living your life

759
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:03,569
right and we just you know a few highs

760
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:08,039
but not any real communication you know

761
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:11,220
and I just died of Tears what I'd like

762
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:14,070
had to be one of five people it was

763
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:16,259
either Ryan Martinez Marshall Davis

764
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:20,220
Kelly bellissima

765
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:27,900
you know who grew that our jungle boys

766
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:30,629
out of LA they wanted me to come on

767
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:35,519
board with them but they're their

768
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:40,140
culture isn't exactly my culture they

769
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:42,239
have a certain swagger you know where

770
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:48,739
I'm more of the low-key quiet farmer

771
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:48,739
yeah I don't play with anything white

772
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:59,159
I smoke weed what do you think of the

773
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:03,289
emergence of the plant medicines as a

774
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:06,449
viable life strategy like psilocybin and

775
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:10,679
like like like sighted to see the

776
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:13,469
research you know so being in the

777
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:16,349
medical industry for a long time and so

778
00:38:13,469 --> 00:38:19,949
I jumped into the medical industry few

779
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:25,319
people 15 compliant right when it

780
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:30,839
happened in California in 97 so DC

781
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:32,700
collective and and a couple other

782
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:42,539
collectors in the valley you know I

783
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:44,879
worked with starting and in 2006 when

784
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:48,090
Montana went legal that's where my

785
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,880
family had moved to when I was 18 it's

786
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:52,380
like you know what let's do Montana so

787
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,780
we went up there and for seven years

788
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:57,990
eight years we really worked hard up

789
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:03,660
there Montana was a unique opportunity

790
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:06,269
because there there issuances medical

791
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:08,969
carts were so restrictive that the

792
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:11,340
people who got cards were truly similar

793
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:13,709
what you're doing in your agriculture

794
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,260
practices what we're championing is the

795
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:18,480
tip of the regenerative expir that will

796
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,630
influence the whole industry in the next

797
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,250
10 to 20 years yeah it'll be uh it's

798
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:26,099
something that needs to happen because

799
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:29,159
intense training of our water the

800
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:31,170
salting of our fields and I mean I suck

801
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:33,899
because I'm a farmer and I understand

802
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:39,769
salts and and it's easy and it's quick

803
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:44,099
and it's an instant fix and I get it

804
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:47,219
from both sides you know that yes using

805
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:52,849
them long term contaminates our soil but

806
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:55,829
I'm down to a quarter of what a normal

807
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:58,588
farmer would do you know and I mean I'm

808
00:39:55,829 --> 00:40:01,728
still amusing alfalfa pellets and

809
00:39:58,588 --> 00:40:05,989
it's another thing I'm using in my soil

810
00:40:01,728 --> 00:40:08,278
so you know I'm creating a rich soil of

811
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:11,568
nutrient based solution you want to see

812
00:40:08,278 --> 00:40:11,568
what's in our soil is it
