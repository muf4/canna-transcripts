Council first talks about the subject

29
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:20,489
through their ordinances and so forth

30
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:23,118
and it's great to see so many of our

31
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:26,789

32
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:30,780
Fiona MA from San Francisco home of the

33
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,540
medicinal cannabis movements served on

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,519
the San Francisco Board of Supervisors

35
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:38,759
then six years in the State Assembly now

36
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,349
I am your friendly tax collector trying

37
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,649
to collect sales taxes on the

38
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:46,048
dispensaries and found the big elephant

39
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,570
in the room is lack of banking access so

40
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,430
I am and have been working on banking

41
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:55,379
access for this industry she's the next

42
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,420
California treasurer fiona is running

43
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:58,228
for state treasurer since this is a

44
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,118
private event

45
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:03,509
I can endorse her so please go out and

46
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:05,250
vote November 6 is it November 6 fiona

47
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,459
has been a supporter of this industry

48
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,868
since it was born and she's teamed up

49
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,280
with a lot of folks up in San Francisco

50
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:14,009
in Sacramento that will make this

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,870
industry easier and better for us I have

52
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,939
witnessed Fiona personally on a number

53
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,109
of panels at John Chung the current

54
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,479
state treasurer has put together to try

55
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:23,040
to solve and crack the nut of banking

56
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,139
I personally represent a lot of

57
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,429
financial institutions in my in my legal

58
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,439
practice so I'm in cannabis related

59
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,019
stuff and Sun a non cannabis related

60
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,509
stuff and even the national banks want

61
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,879
into this industry but there are so many

62
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:36,310
too

63
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,049
when limitations that are put on them as

64
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,430
a national institution especially when

65
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,810
their federal charter is based

66
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,219
you know from grant from the federal

67
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,000
government they are not going to put

68
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:44,859
that at risk if they're a

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,689
multitrillion-dollar bank but if you're

70
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,460
familiar with the bank way banks operate

71
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:49,719
they have these stress tests and the

72
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,310
stress test measure how much cash they

73
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:52,479
have on hand how much assets they have

74
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,490
at hand and how much debt they have

75
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,409
outstanding and a lot of these banks are

76
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,270
imbalanced in these stress tests and

77
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,250
when they're imbalanced that means they

78
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,140
need cash and this is an industry that

79
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,490
is full of cash and nowhere to bank it

80
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:05,349
so I'm working with a number of state

81
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,180
chartered banks right now to actually

82
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:09,400
create protocols for them to take

83
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,860
limited deposits from highly vetted

84
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,240
depositors what does that mean that

85
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,160
means that not everyone is going to get

86
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,480
access to a bank and the people that I

87
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:19,150
see right now in the industry getting

88
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,500
access to banking are those that are

89
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,090
coupled with something else like the

90
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,099
private equity group that's investing in

91
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,539
a cannabis group and they private equity

92
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:26,560
guys have the banking relationship and

93
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,079
get the cannabis group that they

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,310
invested in to partner up with the bank

95
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,620
that they're working with so there's a

96
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,159
lot of a lot of politicking going on

97
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,050
behind the scenes sorry I didn't mean

98
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,669
yeah so the first issue I wanted to talk

99
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,439
about was actually as Fiona what is she

100
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:42,909
seen right now in the banking landscape

101
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,280
from your perspective as a tax collector

102
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:47,560
and then what you see going forward when

103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,460
you sit in the Treasury see Senator Bob

104
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,289
Hertzberg and I had a bill SB 9:30 that

105
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:56,080
would have allowed state chartered

106
00:03:53,289 --> 00:04:00,459
financial institutions to apply for a

107
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:04,360
limited permission to bank the cannabis

108
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:06,120
industry we were hoping that this would

109
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,430
have to be a closed loop system

110
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,469
privately insured but we were hoping

111
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,170
that a number of institutions would be

112
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:17,259
part of the network and folks could

113
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:19,419
deposit their cash and they could pay

114
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:21,789
their vendors through like a venmo or

115
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:24,189
PayPal type of system they could pay

116
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,980
their taxes and they could pay their

117
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:29,860
rent which is like the largest you know

118
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,240
one of the largest expenses however the

119
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,500
bill got stuck in the assembly

120
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,840
Appropriations Committee

121
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,379
Bob Hertzberg and I are gonna run the

122
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:41,469
bill again but I have something to

123
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:43,389
announce excellent senator Steve

124
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,250
Bradford who is chair of the Banking

125
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:46,269
Committee and I are gonna run a public

126
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,160
being

127
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:57,490
bill next year many of you have

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:05:00,580
advocated advocated Ford and running the

129
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,800
bill this past year seeing how much

130
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:03,699
support we got from legislators on both

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,689
sides of the aisle

132
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:09,610
hardly any no votes I think it is time

133
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:11,769
people in Sacramento understand that

134
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,840
this is a crisis and we need to get

135
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:17,439
something done so I look forward to

136
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:21,429
working with the next governor on more

137
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,420
of these type of issues excellent all

138
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,920
right so when we had our phone

139
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,100
conversation one of the biggest issues

140
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,350
that came up was taxes along with

141
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,420
educating consumers and educating people

142
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,129
in the public so I want to now turn it

143
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,020
over to Tim who had a very interesting

144
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:36,430
perspective on taxes and issues dealing

145
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,289
with the farms up north and what's

146
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,000
happening to them because of the tax

147
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,020
crunch for lack of a better word so if

148
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,240
you could kind of explain what's going

149
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:44,560
on and and how you're seeing that world

150
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,610
right now because it was to me it was

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,689
fascinating because being in Southern

152
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,670
California and dealing with a lot of

153
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:50,829
indoor growers and distributors and

154
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:54,240
banks I'm not seeing that the landscape

155
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:57,129
that you're seeing in the trenches well

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:01,269
it's even larger than a tax that she was

157
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:04,269
it's a calamity you look four years ago

158
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:06,969
we brought up about 400 people to Eureka

159
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:08,319
to have a gathering of the supervisors

160
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,670
in the fire department everybody talked

161
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,750
about how we're gonna brace cannabis and

162
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,310
there was a standing ovation at the end

163
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,339
it was an incredible experience

164
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,290
last week the BCC came up to Humble to

165
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:18,759
you know do their Roadshow and there

166
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,460
were less than 35 people in the audience

167
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,750
there was nobody showed up no one there

168
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:24,250
were more people from the state than

169
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,019
they were there and I explained to them

170
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,149
that's because they've given up there's

171
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:30,310
no hope there's like Justin talked about

172
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:31,689
a grieving going on swamy talks about a

173
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,670
thousand cuts

174
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:35,649
you basically have people that it's a

175
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:38,290
perfect storm where it wasn't just the

176
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:39,969
taxes it is the taxes but it's the land

177
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,760
use you've got the cultivators that have

178
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,870
to now apply it to building codes you've

179
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,879
got them having to deal with water

180
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,019
boards up north you could get away with

181
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,300
doing whatever you wanted for a long

182
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:50,979
time excuse me because the water boards

183
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,420
and fish and game weren't in now that

184
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,890
they're in it's like they used to fly

185
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,480
helicopters and then you have to go get

186
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,379
a warrant prove that you could go in

187
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,069
there and then go to a lot of trouble

188
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:59,019
with cops

189
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:01,209
now you just fly over with google map

190
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,379
you see it on a computer you sent the

191
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:03,939
ten to twenty thousand dollar are they

192
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:06,399
fine tell them they got a shutdown and

193
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:07,959
they have to so they're sending out

194
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,329
hundreds of notices throughout Humboldt

195
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:12,159
it's Shelly and Trinity and medicine oh

196
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:14,079
they're shutting down the markets the

197
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,450
people that have been here for 40 50 60

198
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,009
years doing this if you looked at the

199
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,899
size of Mendocino on Humboldt Street at

200
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:21,370
Emerald triangle it's larger than what

201
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:22,870
most of the small states in this country

202
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,699
if this was like they said this was a

203
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,560
coalition with coal farmers or if this

204
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,539
was a farming issue in Kansas there's

205
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,500
more farmers being wiped out in the

206
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,580
Emerald triangle that there are in

207
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,769
Kansas or any place where they're

208
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:34,419
subsidizing farm farm alehrer farm but

209
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,649
are those farmers having trouble even

210
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,379
getting through the licensing process

211
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:40,179
are they anyway at the state what you're

212
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:42,639
talking about that you've got less than

213
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,769
300 licensed farms in Mendocino unless

214
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,969
you know less than 400 and Humboldt

215
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:47,919
they're they're having a very

216
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,510
challenging time because of you know

217
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,120
Edie Rosenthal said it we argue years

218
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:54,159
ago it's true Humboldt Mendocino they

219
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,500
weren't made for traditional farming the

220
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,910
land steep there's no soil lack of water

221
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,529
you know it's challenging but then

222
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,720
you've got deserts out here that are

223
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:03,099
bringing 500 thousand square foot farms

224
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,630
in and they're taking the water from the

225
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,650
Sierras or wherever else they're taking

226
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:07,870
it from and they're not in trouble but

227
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:09,729
the landowners up in Mendocino can't use

228
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,769
their own water so between the building

229
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,270
codes the taxes everything you're

230
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:14,529
basically gonna look at 75 percent of

231
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:17,169
the people that built this energy or

232
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:18,579
gonna be gone and in addition to that

233
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,689
you got the micro businesses and they're

234
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:21,370
not letting people do home micro

235
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:22,750
businesses for the most part so the

236
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,910
product makers those small people that

237
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,310
did all that are gone to so I'm excited

238
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,540
about 64 I voted for it with the ona and

239
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,740
everything else I know we're gonna be in

240
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,030
a great world the consumers are gonna

241
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,710
get the best products they could ever

242
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:34,418
hope for we're gonna have you know

243
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,009
cost-effective medicine people are going

244
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:37,449
to jail I'm a huge advocate for all the

245
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:39,250
people rotting away in jails across this

246
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,629
country so I don't want to say it's

247
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,700
negative it's a great thing we're going

248
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:44,200
into but he asked about what we're

249
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,540
seeing for the small farmers and small

250
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,680
product makers and it is a extinction

251
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:50,289
event that they're going through right

252
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:53,379
now I'm gonna dovetail with that that

253
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:54,819
issue to Sabrina and to Amanda both on

254
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:56,559
the education issue because I think that

255
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,570
ties in to having knowledge about the

256
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,429
industry how to deal with everything

257
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,760
from supply chains to consumers and

258
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:05,679
everything else first with Amanda from

259
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,159
from your perspective what are you

260
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,750
seeing as the biggest challenges

261
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:10,009
or your customers or clients and

262
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,289
everything else getting access to

263
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:14,180
information well it's not just about

264
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:16,789
access to information they might have

265
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:19,338
the access but it's I mean you can't

266
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:20,689
take the tax issue lightly like we you

267
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,610
just talked about it in humble or

268
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,670
Mendocino and Trinity but this is a

269
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,899
statewide problem so I mean we got to

270
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:28,519
look at first the fact that California

271
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,559
is entirely different than any other

272
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,078
state right they passed medical laws in

273
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,758
1996 and local government until very

274
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:37,008
recently was the only ones regulating

275
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,750
this so at the time they could put in

276
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,610
tax rates that were higher because there

277
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,188
was no state taxes but even those are

278
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,560
still prohibitively high when you layer

279
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:47,948
state and local but really what happened

280
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,419
is a couple you know consulting firms

281
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:51,799
went around the state and you know told

282
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:53,120
all these cities if you allow and

283
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,729
regulate cannabis we're gonna make you

284
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,110
all this revenue and they kind of made

285
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,909
some promises of rates that were too

286
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,550
high rates that are prohibitively high

287
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:02,778
and we're seeing some cities starting to

288
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:04,399
lower them but a lot of people are just

289
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:08,688
moving out giving up or staying in the

290
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,919
black market and the problem is is once

291
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:11,149
they've heard these lofty numbers it's

292
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,099
really hard for them to come back down

293
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,259
so part of this is the education to

294
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,060
these cities of understanding that these

295
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:18,829
things are also going to bring in other

296
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:21,559
revenues in different ways you know we

297
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:23,000
went down to Lemon Grove one day myself

298
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,409
and a few of our clients to go to a city

299
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,049
council meeting and we went to the bar

300
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:28,278
afterwards and had a couple drinks and

301
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:29,809
it was interesting because if we weren't

302
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:32,299
the regulars that were drinking $2 PB

303
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:33,859
ours we're having $78 drinks and it took

304
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:36,109
the people needs but in this bar were

305
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,419
like wait so the cannabis business isn't

306
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,550
just gonna grow there they're gonna come

307
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:41,328
to our bar and spend money oh wait that

308
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:43,519
means they're also gonna go to the

309
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:46,370
grocery stores right you're gonna buy

310
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,959
houses and this group of random people

311
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,578
in the bar understood the economic

312
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,979
impact that cannabis might have on their

313
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:54,469
town but that's not as simple or common

314
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,970
and experience of what's being you know

315
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,500
put out there and these cities are

316
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,120
really needing to take a look at what is

317
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,058
the overall job creation and economic

318
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,679
impact that regular sales tax could do

319
00:11:02,058 --> 00:11:05,750
there and these companies as a whole and

320
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,969
then talk about what are reasonable tax

321
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,039
rates and that's really where we're

322
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,629
seeing a lot of issues with this because

323
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:12,828
a lot of people are just playing copy

324
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,199
and paste the neighbor well if they can

325
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:17,239
do $25 a square foot I was lonely we had

326
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,708
it somebody that collected taxes that

327
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,990
could give us their perspective on that

328
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,059
issue

329
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,000
right do you track every single tax rate

330
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:26,099
in the state and we've seen some like we

331
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,539
tell people though right yes we have

332
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,009
this chart that has every single tax

333
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:31,708
rate but just because you see this one a

334
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:32,939
lot does not mean it's a good one you

335
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,009
have to look at these tax rates and

336
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,630
actually look at the patterns of cities

337
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:38,338
lowering them so you know one of our

338
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,838
subscribers is the city of Kalinga they

339
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,730
went in and they actually lowered theirs

340
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,560
but they needed empirical you know data

341
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,610
to understand why these weren't working

342
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,469
and they were actually able to find that

343
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,000
information in our tool and lower their

344
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,920
rates but we're gonna have to see a lot

345
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,129
more of this for it to work there's no

346
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,289
way otherwise yeah I mean I can give

347
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:59,490
sort of a real-world example of that in

348
00:11:55,289 --> 00:12:02,879
Berkeley they had passed a 10% adult use

349
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,169
tax in 2010 when prop 19 was on the

350
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,708
ballot and they were expecting it to

351
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:07,409
pass

352
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:10,259
but prop 19 didn't have any tax rates

353
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:12,569
written into its actual initiatives so

354
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:17,009
there was no 15% excise tax there was no

355
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:18,720
cultivation tax and 10% at that time it

356
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:20,490
wouldn't be as significant without the

357
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,250
tax rate but when you're incorporating

358
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:26,039
prop 64 and all of the additional

359
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,350
layering and compounding tax rates that

360
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,610
you're dealing with 10% and the way it

361
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,909
was written was through the whole supply

362
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,919
chain so if you wanted to get a

363
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:36,328
manufactured product in Berkeley get it

364
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,458
tested in Berkeley and sell it in

365
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:42,000
Berkeley that's 10% on every single

366
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:44,219
layer so that's a local tax of 30% and

367
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,708
if they ever legalized cultivation in

368
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,509
Berkeley it would be another one so that

369
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,949
was a pretty big fight and we realized

370
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:52,049
very early on that this was not

371
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,759
sustainable at all and we were already

372
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:55,139
dealing with the illicit market and

373
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,110
trying to compete with that and those

374
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:01,470
economic incentives and so it did take a

375
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,060
lot of educating of the City Council and

376
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,649
the public I mean there were some people

377
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:07,259
that came out of the woodwork that

378
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:11,070
shocked me I was I was truly surprised

379
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:12,929
and in Berkeley people were were

380
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:16,200
spouting this reefer madness and that

381
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:19,708
high tax rates or it was sort of a

382
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,480
counterintuitive approach that they had

383
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:23,129
where if you were to lower the taxes

384
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,990
then there would be lower revenue and

385
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:27,299
the city was so excited about all of the

386
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,320
taxes that they were going to get and so

387
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,959
they were against it the the

388
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,400
Department and we really had to remind

389
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,230
them that everybody was going to the

390
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,240
illicit market they were not enforcing

391
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,039
anything and there were these high tax

392
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,470
rates and so there was really no way for

393
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,819
them to generate the tax revenue that

394
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,639
they were expecting with these high

395
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,770
rates and also explaining of how the

396
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:50,259
language was written they need to turn

397
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:54,250
it move the the rate lower so we got it

398
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:55,929
cut after about a six weeks of lobbying

399
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,519
the City Council and working with the

400
00:13:55,929 --> 00:14:00,519
local community leaders we were finally

401
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,840
able to pass an ordinance that actually

402
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,179
move the rate down to five percent

403
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,330
across the supply chain and can I just

404
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:09,399
add amanda brings up something sorry

405
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,290
Sabrina brings up something important

406
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,409
when she said lobbying the City Council

407
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:16,089
it is really important for all of you

408
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:19,509
who are in this industry and care about

409
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:22,180
this industry to show up at City Council

410
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:23,889
meetings at the state level we have you

411
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:26,019
know a number of like we had probably 10

412
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:28,480
different cannabis bills running through

413
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:30,189
the state legislature and if you know

414
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,500
elected members don't see you up there

415
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,330
then they say okay well you know maybe

416
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,429
they don't care you know it's not really

417
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,100
important to us we'll just you know not

418
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:41,769
fight for it so we are just imploring

419
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,810
you all to get more involved you know

420
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:45,610
sign up for our newsletters follow us on

421
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:47,229
Twitter you know we're always announcing

422
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,750
you know how you all can get more

423
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:52,509
involved and of course get to know your

424
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,029
local elected officials your state

425
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:57,610
assembly member your senator and anybody

426
00:14:55,029 --> 00:15:00,759
else that when issues come up you know

427
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,310
please send an email call in I mean your

428
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,379
voice really does matter and one other

429
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:07,659
thing to add to about working with the

430
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:11,409
cities so like the people of Berkeley

431
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:13,029
are really lucky that BPG has a Sabrina

432
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:14,379
and actually invests in it because

433
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:16,269
they're all benefiting from it together

434
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:18,850
but you can't rely on other people to do

435
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:20,799
this work for you like I say it

436
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,110
adamantly like a compliance and

437
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,240
government affairs program are not as

438
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,460
simple as just hiring a compliance

439
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,289
officer you and the difference between

440
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,690
the ones that are you know okay and

441
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:33,009
getting by and wildly successful are the

442
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,460
ones that have a government affairs

443
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:37,990
program it is incredibly critical to

444
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,330
have these pieces in place because

445
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,700
Berkeley got to have that education from

446
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,190
Sabrina but the thing that we also have

447
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,470
to be really

448
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,060
careful with taxes and educating to is

449
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,500
that they need to understand the

450
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:49,909
different portions of the supply chain

451
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,700
there's different people that have been

452
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:54,319
writing these tax measures and you can

453
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,570
tell what an HDL tax measure looks like

454
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,060
it's got one like gross receipts price

455
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,950
generally for retail and then another

456
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:03,469
one across the board for all the others

457
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,850
if you look at an STI consulting one or

458
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,320
muni services you're gonna see each

459
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,720
piece actually getting explored

460
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,700
differently and you might see in one

461
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,410
city they might you know come out at

462
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,030
three dollars a square foot for our

463
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:15,529
cultivation and in another they may come

464
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:17,629
out at six dollars because you need to

465
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:20,329
actually do the analysis of what these

466
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:22,340
businesses look like in your city the

467
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,750
same consulting firm should come up with

468
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,639
different answers in each of these

469
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,049
different categories based on what is a

470
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,759
business gonna look like they're right

471
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:30,889
imagine if you're doing the same price

472
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,110
per square foot and humble as you are

473
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:35,210
doing in Los Angeles right they're

474
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,419
unfair why cuz I'm both they're growing

475
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,830
outside you need a lot more space

476
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:43,099
whereas indoors they're gonna grow a lot

477
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,570
more in a much tighter you know spot so

478
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,879
you actually have to look at each

479
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,890
vertical that you're going to be taxing

480
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,539
and give them an individual analysis and

481
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:52,399
and make sure your government

482
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:54,409
understands what those businesses look

483
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,750
like in your jurisdiction rather than

484
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:58,639
them saying okay well we're right next

485
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,100
to Oakland let's copy Oakland cuz we're

486
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,659
you know the neighbors every city is

487
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,180
different and you really got to educate

488
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:06,019
I was gonna add I tell this to my

489
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,509
clients all the time

490
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:10,430
that don't forget this is still a real

491
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:12,379
estate centric business you can't get a

492
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,180
license without being tied to some real

493
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,670
estate in some local jurisdictions so

494
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,680
you really have three masters you have

495
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,120
the local government master that you

496
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,189
have to be compliant with whether it's

497
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,448
zoning taxes whatever then you have the

498
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:24,650
state master that you have to be

499
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:26,120
compliant with and make sure you're

500
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,740
properly licensed and doing business

501
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,149
with a licensed folks and then of course

502
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,349
you have the conflict of law with the

503
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,210
federal government where the Treasury

504
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,949
says one thing the Department of Justice

505
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,240
says another and so you have all of

506
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,710
these different narrow paths that you

507
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,210
have to follow and of course it makes

508
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,519
great work for lawyers like us to help

509
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,380
you navigate it but at the same time it

510
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,420
is a massive headache for everybody

511
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,530
involved and so getting information and

512
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,870
getting in touch with those folks and

513
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:49,849
and and being present is is really

514
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:51,719
really important I wanted to transition

515
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:53,849
because we have a lot of topics to cover

516
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,350
and say that all of this with the tax

517
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:57,209
issues the real estate issues and

518
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:58,918
everything are hamstrung even further

519
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,210
because of the banking issues and the

520
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,799
banking issue is a nightmare when I

521
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,569
first met Fiona a couple years ago she

522
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:05,639
came and spoke at my law firm we hosted

523
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:07,649
an event and I made a joke to her I said

524
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,020
what if I just take all of my gross

525
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,220
revenue

526
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:12,808
paetynn cash to the state and just get a

527
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,058
refund check and she said to me she goes

528
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:16,259
well because it would work but the state

529
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:18,869
would become the biggest laundry money

530
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:20,609
laundry money money longer in the world

531
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:22,308
and I said you're probably already the

532
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:25,649
largest money launderer in the whole

533
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:27,720
absolutely yeah right yeah so we want

534
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,429
you to pay your taxes like if the states

535
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,990
the money launderer then well now you

536
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:34,080
got a Treasury you've got a Treasury

537
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:38,220
check right okay so so here's the great

538
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:41,099
irony we want everyone who is selling a

539
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,140
tangible personal product to take out a

540
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,959
seller's permit and pay your sales taxes

541
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,090
we don't ask who you are we don't need a

542
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,419
background check we just want you to pay

543
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:53,579
your taxes and we take your taxes count

544
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:56,309
it walk across the street to Bank of

545
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:58,619
America and deposit however you cannot

546
00:18:56,308 --> 00:19:00,599
go to Bank of America and open up a bank

547
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:01,949
account or deposit any money into Bank

548
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,779
of America and if I over how does that

549
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,808
make sense if I overpay I get a refund

550
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:08,730
check if you ever pay if I overpay

551
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:10,259
everything I'd get a refund check for

552
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,849
everything right and I did check that

553
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:13,650
because that was a loophole to say if

554
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:15,808
everybody put their money in you know

555
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:23,610
can't we just hold you can you become a

556
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:26,579
public well right always trying to think

557
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:29,279
outside the box right so let me get my

558
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:30,569
notes so I turned 46 in June and all of

559
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,158
a sudden I need these things on my face

560
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,418
and I can't see the audience when I have

561
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:34,980
them on and I can't see the paper when I

562
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,320
have them off so you'll see me going up

563
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:42,808
and thank you how I am when I'm driving

564
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:45,389
yeah right so I wanted to go back to to

565
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:48,990
the banking and and talk to you a Tim

566
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,759
about what what the what the market is

567
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,429
looking like for folks that they still

568
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,808
have no access to banking up in farm

569
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:57,390
country and Humboldt and everywhere else

570
00:19:54,808 --> 00:20:00,359
and is that also adding to the crippling

571
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:02,650
effect that you're seeing and also is it

572
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:04,299
resulting in a gray market or

573
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,070
an unlicensed market where we now have

574
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:07,450
competing markets of people that are

575
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:08,200
dealing in the little licensed world and

576
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,808
people that are dealing in the

577
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,460
unlicensed world yeah well I'm a CUNY

578
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:14,950
credit up in Garberville and humbles is

579
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,720
actually giving some banking to cannabis

580
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,340
people now and some of the smaller

581
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,579
community credit unions are working with

582
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:23,019
that Humboldt because they took all the

583
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:24,730
heavy fines against those growers that

584
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:25,808
the black markets thriving in Humboldt

585
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,210
and because there's not that many

586
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:29,859
licensed farmers the legal markets

587
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,808
thriving - so right now for farmers it's

588
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:32,919
a decent market although 900 bucks a

589
00:20:31,808 --> 00:20:34,329
pound isn't really a great price

590
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,590
compared to what it used to be but at

591
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:38,169
least they've stabilized from where it

592
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:40,178
was five or six last year we have

593
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,710
California labour solutions where we do

594
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:43,600
our own labor solution and pay cash

595
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,519
payroll to try to get around that but

596
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,199
it's a real challenging thing I've been

597
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,670
telling people over 40 years you look at

598
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,110
Al Capone he went to jail for tax

599
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,269
evasion and money laundering nothing

600
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:54,669
else so I've told people you know my

601
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:56,889
whole life is an outlaw that your

602
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,150
partner is the IRS and your tax people

603
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,040
and I'll tell you what they will get you

604
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,900
in trouble before anybody else will so

605
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,519
give them their share and just be cool

606
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,050
with them so they're really trying to do

607
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,730
their best to take that money in I mean

608
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:08,740
Fiona in the state everybody are really

609
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,910
doing what they can you can look at

610
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,140
what's going on in the Canadian thing

611
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,700
where they're shutting down the borders

612
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,230
not letting Canadian companies in and

613
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,850
and people and that's because they see

614
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,990
this powerful thing that's about to take

615
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:19,269
over the whole world while we're

616
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,679
fighting over this the Canadians and the

617
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:22,569
Israelis and Colombians are looking at

618
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,130
dividing up the world markets so I have

619
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:26,259
clients that are creating investment

620
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,640
vehicles in Canada simply to hold money

621
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:28,720
in the Canada with the hopes that one

622
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,950
day they could bring that money from

623
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,750
Canada into the state let's

624
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,740
concentration and a dozen others that

625
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,359
we're working with that are doing the

626
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,859
same thing and they're just raising

627
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,479
money in the public markets and then

628
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:42,849
saying we'll have a small operation in

629
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,170
Canada and once the floodgate opens that

630
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:45,759
money will be able to pour into United

631
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,590
States but you have to understand that

632
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,460
small farmers you know typically if you

633
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:49,629
look at the people have been in this

634
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,220
business they're introverted shy

635
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,020
mountain people they went up there

636
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,850
they're not branding experts they're not

637
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:56,769
social media people they don't go to a

638
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:58,269
lot of events I mean you go to more and

639
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:59,950
more events the old-timers we say we see

640
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:01,509
less and less of the old schoolers every

641
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,308
time you turn around you see more suits

642
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:04,569
right see more suits and I'm not saying

643
00:22:03,308 --> 00:22:06,308
it's wrong that's the industry where

644
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:07,689
it's going and stuff but I don't think

645
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:09,369
there's really much you can turn that

646
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,809
around for a lot of my friends and

647
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,219
family and people in those mountains the

648
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:13,899
unfortunate thing is they're not going

649
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,759
to see the new world kind of like Moses

650
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,759
but that doesn't mean it's not the right

651
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,140
way to go it's not

652
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:20,359
it is a great thing that we're doing

653
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,000
there just is a very a challenging time

654
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:25,039
for them we remember they have an extra

655
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,960
heart up there to like I know many that

656
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,879
bury their money and then there's forest

657
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,559
fires that come through and people have

658
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,550
lost their entire life savings because

659
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,309
they can't get their money into a bank

660
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:35,990
it's gone up in flames literally and and

661
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:41,089
where else is it gonna go it's too much

662
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:44,630
to stick under a bed problem I will say

663
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:45,859
that it's not thinking it's not a 100

664
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,470
percent impossible as you were saying

665
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:50,929
they kind of do it up there but there's

666
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:53,569
a lot of you to be very careful there's

667
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:55,519
FinCEN guidelines and you know just the

668
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:59,509
the sheer physical moving of the cash

669
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:02,329
from the dispensary to the next place

670
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:05,319
that it goes to the bank and scheduling

671
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:07,339
the pickups and it is legitimately

672
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:08,689
disconcerting I will say that was

673
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:10,369
something I when I was at normal I

674
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,250
didn't it was a sort of a talking point

675
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:15,049
and an issue but then actually being in

676
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:17,509
it seeing how it works and and how the

677
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:19,730
scheduling works and it's it is truly

678
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:21,259
it's very uncountable and can be very

679
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,079
scary owners that's part of my practice

680
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:25,759
and so I actually create checklists and

681
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:29,059
due diligence checklists for banks on

682
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,440
the on the SAR kyc AML issues and once

683
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,089
the banks figure out how much work is

684
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,450
involved they don't want to do it

685
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:33,889
anymore

686
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,390
and if you go to the board of directors

687
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,710
and if spent all this time you know

688
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,700
paying a lawyer to set it up for you and

689
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,870
the board of directors says well we

690
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,830
don't want to do cannabis all of a

691
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:41,659
sudden it's just money out the window

692
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:42,679
for these banks not that we feel bad for

693
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,560
the bank's putting money out the window

694
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,080
but you have to realize how the

695
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:49,609
suspicious activity report what it

696
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,889
really is in essence the federal

697
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:53,659
government has deputized the banks to

698
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:56,509
act as their eyes and ears on the ground

699
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,460
to look for suspicious activity FinCEN

700
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:59,690
in its wisdom took the Cole memo from

701
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,400
the federal from the Department of

702
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,110
Justice and said we're gonna bootstrap

703
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,420
this into a way for banks to be able to

704
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:07,459
file these suspicious activity reports

705
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,230
but create these limited marijuana czars

706
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,600
so that they can actually bank stay

707
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,039
compliant businesses on January 4th

708
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,529
justice sessions as we all know

709
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,629
rescinded the Cole memo but FinCEN two

710
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:19,190
weeks later reaffirmed it and reaffirmed

711
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,060
the FinCEN guidelines so now the banks

712
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,740
are kind of like do we do what the

713
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,970
Treasury says or do where the Department

714
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,710
of Justice says and they're in this

715
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,930
conundrum of not even knowing where the

716
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,279
federal government stands and and that's

717
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,190
just a microcosm of our federal

718
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:33,358
government right now

719
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:38,159
go ahead so we were talking about taxes

720
00:24:33,358 --> 00:24:41,220
earlier and we are very low in terms of

721
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:44,070
how much we have collected in California

722
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,769
taxes versus what we estimated so the

723
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:49,408
first six months in 2018 we collected

724
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:50,848
about 82 million dollars of taxes we

725
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:53,099
estimated we would collect about a

726
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:55,678
hundred and eighty five million dollars

727
00:24:53,098 --> 00:25:01,138
and there's a couple of reasons I think

728
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:04,169
number one the state is just it is

729
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:05,428
starting to issue permanent licenses but

730
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,639
they're waiting for the local government

731
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:11,099
and some of the localities have not

732
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:12,808
approved cannabis are still working it

733
00:25:11,098 --> 00:25:15,479
out still fighting about it or their

734
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:17,788
taxes are too high where companies don't

735
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:20,038
want to locate in that jurisdiction in

736
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:22,919
comparison Nevada for the first six

737
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:25,408
months collected 195 million dollars in

738
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,499
taxes right Colorado and Washington

739
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:30,778
which were the first two states to

740
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:34,528
actually have adult used Colorado

741
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:37,618
collected 114 million Washington 67

742
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:40,618
million yet Nevada just passed last year

743
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:43,348
and they're at 195 more than California

744
00:25:40,618 --> 00:25:47,128
estimated so you know I think taxes

745
00:25:43,348 --> 00:25:49,108
regulations fees you know it's it's

746
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,728
mind-boggling here in California that

747
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:52,408
part of the problem is this is that we

748
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:54,629
gave too much power to the local

749
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:57,840
government and it's a patchwork and

750
00:25:54,628 --> 00:26:00,388
mosaic of rules and laws that are very

751
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,548
difficult to follow very costly and if

752
00:26:00,388 --> 00:26:04,769
the state would have would set its own

753
00:26:02,548 --> 00:26:07,168
standard and then municipalities could

754
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:09,659
just say yes or no I think would be much

755
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:12,479
easier in that regard but and then you

756
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:15,509
have thank you guys and then you have

757
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:17,098
the other issue which is I can't

758
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:18,950
remember which city is which but Santa

759
00:26:17,098 --> 00:26:21,628
Ana and Costa Mesa have their own

760
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:23,190
regulations about cannabis and how you

761
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:24,509
can sell and where you can sell and one

762
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,369
of them says you have to have a security

763
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:27,479
guard in uniform that's armed and the

764
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:28,528
other one says you can't have armed

765
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:29,759
security guards and you can't have

766
00:26:28,528 --> 00:26:31,048
uniformed security guards so you

767
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,278
literally cross the street and have a

768
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:34,858
totally different scheme that you're

769
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:36,960
operating under for a dispensary and and

770
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:38,368
you're none the wiser as a consumer that

771
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,598
this happens to be the Costa Mesa and

772
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:42,299
that side of the street happens to be

773
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,649
Santa Ana it's a really just disco

774
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,149
you lated world that we're living in

775
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,790
right now and the way it's set up and

776
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:50,280
it's a Richard like prop 64 passed by

777
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:52,680
the voters right so the only way we can

778
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:54,869
change California voters California

779
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,820
voters the only way we can change any of

780
00:26:54,869 --> 00:27:00,000
the provisions the major provisions in

781
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:02,700
that initiative is to go back to the

782
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,519
voters and that's something that I think

783
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,410
people don't understand is when we pass

784
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,210
an initiative at the state level by the

785
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,730
people we can only change it by going

786
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:14,009
back on the ballot and asking the people

787
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:18,240
if we can change it if the legislature

788
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:20,069
if you're somebody like and that's her

789
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,779
whole knowledge of the world right all

790
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:23,039
right my mom might be here because I

791
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,629
grew up in Long Beach since she was

792
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,259
gonna come by mom are you here now okay

793
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:30,840
good I actually had my prom in this room

794
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:35,819
and this this pillar right here is where

795
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:37,799
my date left me okay Weston Amy we're

796
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:39,480
gonna tell stories she's like we used to

797
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,829
come here and this ship is haunted and

798
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:50,730
we used to hear people knocking on the

799
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:54,449
wall so yeah I invited my parents of it

800
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:58,319
they didn't show up I guess it's not the

801
00:27:54,450 --> 00:28:00,420
first time and you know I'm one of those

802
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,579
dads like yesterday was soccer practice

803
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,590
and I was I was here so I can't I'm it

804
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:06,990
it's history repeating itself all right

805
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:09,299
I digress one of the things I wanted to

806
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,650
ask you specifically was this and I had

807
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,480
this conversation with Xavier Becerra

808
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,560
I've had this conversation with glory

809
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,789
Ajax and I want to have this

810
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:16,349
conversation with you and we talked

811
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:18,180
about it on the phone the state's

812
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:19,799
infrastructure for dealing with the

813
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,080
cannabis regulations and enforcement

814
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:24,809
what does that look like right now and

815
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,699
what should it really look like be

816
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:30,629
careful what you wish for right right

817
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:34,410
what the enforcement is is not there yet

818
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:36,990
so we are still trying to you know just

819
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:39,060
get licenses issued the track and trace

820
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,220
system is ready to go

821
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:46,769
according to Richard parrot of the

822
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:50,250
Department of food and a great endeavor

823
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:52,619
ebuddy right now is operating under so

824
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,970
track and trace is gonna go first then

825
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:56,159
once everyone gets onto

826
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:59,880
that system then I think we'll be able

827
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:02,009
to enforce those good actors versus

828
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,900
those bad actors that sounds excellent

829
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:05,220
so but Sara said to me when he got into

830
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,680
office this is right when he took over

831
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,660
over as Attorney General he said we have

832
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,580
a great infrastructure in place for

833
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,990
sanctuary cities and sanctuary state

834
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:14,309
issues and immigration to fight the

835
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,170
federal government and I said what about

836
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:17,789
cannabis he says we don't have anybody

837
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,230
even assigned to a task force at this

838
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,399
point to deal with it and I think that's

839
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,660
really interesting now that was a year

840
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,610
and a half ago two years ago when he

841
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,830
took over so I'm sure the landscape has

842
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:28,229
changed but I saw your friend Kevin

843
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:29,879
daily own six months ago and asked him

844
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,620
what he was focused on it was all about

845
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,300
the immigration issues and the sanctuary

846
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:36,659
state issues as well and cannabis was

847
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:38,700
very far off of his radar as well which

848
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:42,019
hopefully changed changes when he when

849
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,279
he wins the election in November so

850
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:47,430
Sabrina I was actually gonna jump to you

851
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:48,809
and your this is not a softball this is

852
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,009
actually one of the things that you had

853
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:52,349
mentioned to me that I thought was

854
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:54,150
fascinating was how educating the staff

855
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:55,769
and the rule changes are so confusing

856
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,970
and I wanted you to kind of expand on

857
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:58,680
that and explain that to the audience

858
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,360
because we talked about as a lawyer you

859
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,279
know we deal with rules all the time but

860
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:03,899
with boots on the ground I think that

861
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:05,009
the the landscape is much different I'd

862
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,870
like you to kind of explain the

863
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:08,009
dichotomy that exists between us and our

864
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:08,369
suits and the people that are on the

865
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:11,430
ground

866
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:14,689
well January 1st was when all of these

867
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:17,670
new rules started to take effect and

868
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:20,370
there was a lot of preparation for the

869
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:22,080
staff and letting them know well as you

870
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:24,029
know this industry has a lot of rumors

871
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,769
so there was the whole process for the

872
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:28,200
emergency regulations that happen in

873
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:29,430
2017 people were we're talking some

874
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,990
people thought they were implemented

875
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,789
already and and people didn't really

876
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,769
realize that you know there were certain

877
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:36,869
timelines for this so we had to make

878
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:38,579
sure that they knew that things were

879
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:39,809
going to change the rules as they are

880
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:41,699
now are not going to be the rules

881
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:44,250
forever and please be patient with me

882
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,809
and and with this whole process because

883
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,519
it's it's completely out of my hands but

884
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:49,559
we have to play by this game so we had

885
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,339
to you know explain how the rules were

886
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:54,929
working pre July 1st and it also had to

887
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:56,609
sort of switch over our whole business

888
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,830
model not our whole business model but

889
00:30:56,609 --> 00:31:00,299
previously where we had our buyers would

890
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:02,099
work directly with the vendors and

891
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:03,809
didn't go through the distributors and

892
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:05,750
that entire process and then with the

893
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:07,279
excise tax collection

894
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,019
there were a lot of steps there are a

895
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,509
lot of checklists that I had to create

896
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:12,980
to pass out to the staff to sort of let

897
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:15,529
them know how this works

898
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,930
and then when July first kicked in and

899
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:19,609
you had the new testing rules you had

900
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:22,700
the new packaging and the new labeling

901
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:24,589
rules and then that sort of created what

902
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,049
as anybody who's a retailer or

903
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:29,240
distributor manufacturer cultivator

904
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:32,869
knows everybody had their own

905
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:35,809
interpretation on what was compliant

906
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:37,849
packaging or compliant labeling and so

907
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:39,019
oh sorry sorry go ahead I was just gonna

908
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:41,209
say so there was a lot of back-and-forth

909
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:43,700
I heard somebody on the the earlier

910
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:46,910
panel was saying you know they were sort

911
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,500
of talking about how they had to go and

912
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,550
talk to the retailers and the retailers

913
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,980
were we're having their own

914
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:53,329
interpretation and and so there was a

915
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,009
lot of back-and-forth and our buyer

916
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,929
would would come and ask a lot of

917
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:59,930
questions and and what the distributors

918
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:01,220
were telling them you know we I discuss

919
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,799
with their lawyer and we were just like

920
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,779
we we can't you know what the DPH is

921
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:07,700
telling you is compliant is great but

922
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:10,849
we're licensed by the bureau were

923
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,940
inspected by the bureau and I I just

924
00:32:10,849 --> 00:32:16,309
don't see the bureau thinking that it's

925
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:18,470
okay to have you know certain types of

926
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:20,779
products with certain labels or that's

927
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:24,289
not gonna fly with them and if for for

928
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:25,879
example no nowhere in the regulations is

929
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:27,680
really do they address what the

930
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:33,140
packaging and labeling rules are for

931
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:35,660
clones or seeds and so DPH doesn't

932
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:38,570
address it the bureau doesn't really

933
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:40,460
address it and CDFA doesn't really

934
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:43,519
address it pages everybody refers back

935
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:45,019
to each other but then so we were like

936
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,450
with the only place that addresses it is

937
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:48,980
in statute it's in the business and

938
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,019
Professions Code which says every

939
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,360
cannabis and cannabis product has to be

940
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:56,690
in a child-resistant resealable blah

941
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:58,339
blah blah package and you that upset a

942
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,110
lot of people and and there's been a lot

943
00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:02,000
of debate but ultimately we were like

944
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:04,069
this is literally the only thing that we

945
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,569
can lean on and we're gonna have to go

946
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:08,059
with this until there's a conscious

947
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:10,250
statute right actual statute until

948
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:11,419
there's more clarity or some you know we

949
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,490
always ask people if you have a letter

950
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,028
from the bureau that says this is okay

951
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,669
we

952
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:17,960
have a conversation but you know and now

953
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:19,879
everybody has to get ready because we're

954
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,798
gonna gear up for more changes we just

955
00:33:19,878 --> 00:33:23,569
finished the comment period the first

956
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:26,298
round of comment period for permanent

957
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:28,339
regulations and that's gonna kick back

958
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:30,429
into gear in October and November and

959
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:33,888
then there's gonna be more changes in

960
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:35,929
2019 one practical takeaway don't find

961
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:38,628
more packaging than you can use in the

962
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:40,369
next six months they will continue to

963
00:33:38,628 --> 00:33:41,959
change it on you and you will end up

964
00:33:40,368 --> 00:33:44,618
with a bunch of waste and don't try to

965
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,869
tell the retailers that it's compliant

966
00:33:44,618 --> 00:33:49,579
cuz we know and I just sat on a panel

967
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:52,278
with the Department of Food and

968
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:53,598
Agriculture Food and also the Department

969
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:57,169
California Department of Public Health

970
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:59,118
and they would like folks to go to their

971
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:02,839
website they try to put as much

972
00:33:59,118 --> 00:34:04,608
information up there and FAQ page as

973
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:05,808
well and if you have any questions

974
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:09,710
they're really encouraging you to call

975
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:12,378
them call or email them ok so that's

976
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:15,199
that's their message to everybody the CD

977
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:17,298
TFA has been absolutely amazing and they

978
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,730
definitely advocate that anything you

979
00:34:17,298 --> 00:34:21,318
get everything in writing that is

980
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,929
absolutely critical because you talk to

981
00:34:21,318 --> 00:34:25,489
one person one day and they'll tell you

982
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,628
one thing then you talk another person

983
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:28,219
the next day and they'll tell you

984
00:34:26,628 --> 00:34:29,659
something completely different so as

985
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:31,038
long as you can get it in writing and

986
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:33,318
you can show you're making a good-faith

987
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,819
effort I'm gonna bring up one more topic

988
00:34:33,318 --> 00:34:37,940
very very quickly that I'm seen as a

989
00:34:34,818 --> 00:34:40,519
lawyer in the industry there are really

990
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,318
two to two topics that have been coming

991
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:45,019
up quite a bit which I think you guys

992
00:34:42,318 --> 00:34:47,480
have to have just to just be be

993
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:50,259
cognizant of one is is that remember

994
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,668
that bankruptcy is a federal process and

995
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:54,139
cannabis businesses and even cannabis

996
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:55,668
adjacent businesses are being kicked out

997
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:57,200
of bankruptcy courts because the

998
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:59,028
trustees that are being assigned can't

999
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,348
even take control of these businesses

1000
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:03,019
because their source of money is coming

1001
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:05,088
from sources that are not legitimate in

1002
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:06,079
their eyes so one of the things I've

1003
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,639
been doing is is what I call

1004
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,170
alternatives to bankruptcy assignments

1005
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,118
for benefit of predators which people

1006
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,318
are not very familiar with receivership

1007
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,670
so you go to state court that's like

1008
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,288
state court to put a receiver over the

1009
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,480
business we've been doing it on behalf

1010
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:19,910
of creditors on behalf of partners that

1011
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,889
are having disputes it's been an

1012
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:23,358
ever-expanding landscape and actually

1013
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:25,039
this is how I got into this industry ten

1014
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,019
years ago when a bank client asked

1015
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,670
to deal with a property that they

1016
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:31,070
thought was a refrigerated warehousing

1017
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,840
facility Houghton Pomona and did a site

1018
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,760
inspection I discovered it was a giant

1019
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,280
million square foot cannabis grow

1020
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,480
facility and they had to call the loan

1021
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,250
but couldn't take possession of the

1022
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,900
property because they can't foreclose so

1023
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,789
I actually put it in receivership had

1024
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,410
the receivers sell the flower sell the

1025
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:46,969
license and sell the property back then

1026
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:49,309
it was medical marijuana use it was not

1027
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:50,719
under Prop 64

1028
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:52,699
the other thing that I was going tell

1029
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,809
you is this product liability claims are

1030
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:55,189
starting to come in the door where we're

1031
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:57,110
defending product liability claims

1032
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,780
what's in what's just not disclosing

1033
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:01,849
properly what's in the package not not

1034
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,230
giving warnings to customers that are

1035
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:05,469
not used to eating an edible that's

1036
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:09,829
going to put them in bed for four days

1037
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:10,909
prop 6065 issues with chemicals that

1038
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:12,230
cause cancer you know you go into a

1039
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:14,420
restaurant says this facility may

1040
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:16,670
contain you know products that contain

1041
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,680
cancerous materials or whatever that's a

1042
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:20,090
huge huge thing that's coming down the

1043
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:22,069
pike you don't think the plaintiffs

1044
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:24,170
lawyers are out there right now waiting

1045
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:26,990
for those big businesses and cannabis to

1046
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:28,519
to take them to court they are out there

1047
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:30,139
and once the once the big plaintiffs

1048
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,179
lawyers are out there suing you know the

1049
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:33,679
big companies of the world they're the

1050
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:34,699
targets start becoming more and more

1051
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:36,649
narrow so you've got to be really

1052
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:38,299
cognizant of that and be very careful of

1053
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,670
that that's what's happening and to

1054
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,980
bring up insurance of course our

1055
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:46,010
Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones has

1056
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,719
been issuing licenses to different

1057
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:49,760
insurance carriers for different type of

1058
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:52,309
licenses so you know please look on

1059
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,750
their website Camille Dixon is his

1060
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:58,219
expert in these insurance issues but

1061
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:00,289
insurance is coming to the market -

1062
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:01,730
that's right and I refer clients to

1063
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:03,199
insurance folks all the time at this

1064
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:04,969
point and they and they come to me now

1065
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,829
because they want them to get access to

1066
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:07,849
my clients of course so what in this

1067
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:09,440
lightning round what I want to do is

1068
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:10,610
that's my big issue and big problem that

1069
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,990
I'm seeing with my clients right now I

1070
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,940
want to just go down the table starting

1071
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:15,259
actually Tim going this way what is the

1072
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,150
first one you say what is the biggest

1073
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,890
problem you see in ten words or less and

1074
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,389
then we're gonna go and say what is the

1075
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:21,679
silver lining you see in the next couple

1076
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:22,579
years so let's start with the bat and

1077
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:24,199
then we'll go to the good we'll finish

1078
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:26,569
off with the good the good the good part

1079
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:29,269
is we're California we're gonna dominate

1080
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:31,280
the country the rest of the world

1081
00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:32,929
Thermal Triangle where we came from who

1082
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,630
we are heritage and stuff we're going to

1083
00:37:32,929 --> 00:37:36,068
do fine long term

1084
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,630
the biggest challenges for me is that

1085
00:37:36,068 --> 00:37:39,518
you know you need compliance law

1086
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,749
attorneys you need compliance people you

1087
00:37:39,518 --> 00:37:42,818
need so much that if you don't have a

1088
00:37:40,748 --> 00:37:44,498
lot of money you know a hard time being

1089
00:37:42,818 --> 00:37:45,969
in this industry and so it's not really

1090
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:47,889
a fair playing field this really as you

1091
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:49,058
can see this is a capitalist society and

1092
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:50,679
you're looking at constellation you're

1093
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,119
looking at you know coca-cola you're

1094
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:54,368
looking at some major players coming in

1095
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,960
and it's like how how does small farmers

1096
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:58,028
and have a small product makers compete

1097
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,079
with that see the biggest challenge

1098
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:07,568
would be the constant pivoting the

1099
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:10,990
reeducation just the the wears and tears

1100
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:14,798
of that the silver lining I would say is

1101
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:16,449
that this is a very agile industry that

1102
00:38:14,798 --> 00:38:19,449
has been around for a really long time

1103
00:38:16,449 --> 00:38:24,518
and will continue to be around and we

1104
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:26,618
are we are very creative and able to you

1105
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:30,129
know we've we've survived the the

1106
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:31,660
federal interference we've survived lots

1107
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,818
of trials and tribulations so this is

1108
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:35,588
just another challenge that we're gonna

1109
00:38:33,818 --> 00:38:39,849
have to go through and I think we're

1110
00:38:35,588 --> 00:38:42,009
gonna come out okay I'd say the biggest

1111
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:43,568
obstacle I'm seeing right I don't have

1112
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:46,329
it personally cuz we just track all the

1113
00:38:43,568 --> 00:38:48,759
law but taxes hands down it's taxes

1114
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:50,289
I guess silver lining uh it's gonna keep

1115
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,759
all the attorneys and consultants and

1116
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:53,559
business for a long so we don't do it

1117
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:55,480
yeah we do we have to throw the tea in

1118
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:58,660
the harbor is that we're saying no but

1119
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,400
um no it's a silver lining is that both

1120
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:02,498
history just in the first inning of a

1121
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,210
nine inning baseball game and so we're

1122
00:39:02,498 --> 00:39:05,919
gonna continue to see problems but we're

1123
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,989
gonna also be working to fix those for a

1124
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,389
long time so never expect the

1125
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:11,588
regulations to stay the same and you

1126
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,900
know that's gonna mean a constant

1127
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:16,268
reeducation which is truly a pain point

1128
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,130
but over the next five years there's

1129
00:39:16,268 --> 00:39:19,508
gonna be continuous improvements - and

1130
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,769
these kinks are gonna get worked out

1131
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:22,298
they're just taking a first shot at it

1132
00:39:20,768 --> 00:39:25,419
you can't expect anyone to get it right

1133
00:39:22,298 --> 00:39:28,179
on their first try so the biggest

1134
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:30,400
barrier or challenge to banking access

1135
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:33,940
public safety and collecting taxes is

1136
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,630
Congress Congress the silver lining is

1137
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:38,210
November 6 is coming we need to flip

1138
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:44,750
these

1139
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:46,099
see go out and vote now we if you have

1140
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,170
questions we have a microphone set up

1141
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:49,880
here for questions hi this is an awesome

1142
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:53,570
panel my name is Joe Devlin with the

1143
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,480
city of Sacramento apparently have to

1144
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:58,039
eat the microphone yeah it's like an ice

1145
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,690
cream

1146
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:04,608
so taxes are definitely too high how do

1147
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,139
we facilitate that conversation amongst

1148
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:08,119
the local governments the patchwork

1149
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:09,920
doesn't work I mean there's some things

1150
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:12,588
that can be done CDG if a can lower the

1151
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,820
mark-up rate down to zero tomorrow right

1152
00:40:12,588 --> 00:40:19,130
so that would help but like but across

1153
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:21,830
the state we have to have a more

1154
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:24,079
consistent taxation so how do we you

1155
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:25,579
know the League of Cities is is an

1156
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,380
entity that exists but they're not

1157
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:29,509
leading that conversation is there

1158
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,579
another avenue of facilitating that

1159
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:34,250
dialogue and how do we how do we shorten

1160
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:36,230
that that implementation difference

1161
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:38,838
you mentioned the League of Cities and

1162
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:40,760
SESAC as well but you go into the League

1163
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:42,559
of Cities and I was there as a guest

1164
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,280
once in their office and the password to

1165
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,719
the Wi-Fi no joke was local control and

1166
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,030
that's kind of like I wish it was a joke

1167
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:52,629
but that's actually their password for

1168
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:54,650
the guest Wi-Fi have you needed ever but

1169
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:56,420
that's kind of the problem with the

1170
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:58,639
League of Cities is their thing that

1171
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,588
like what's interesting is they're not

1172
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,659
you know advocating any policy they're

1173
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:04,429
advocating for local control so even

1174
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:07,338
when that you see them as anti delivery

1175
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:08,868
the current delivery regulation not anti

1176
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:10,338
delivery they're anti the cities getting

1177
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:12,410
to choose whether or not deliveries go

1178
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:15,259
to those cities and so it's really hard

1179
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:16,789
when when the you know ethos has always

1180
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,890
been let the cities make their own

1181
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:20,690
decisions so therefore it needs to come

1182
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:21,949
outside of those organizations and

1183
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,539
there's got to be education

1184
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:25,759
opportunities where you can bring in the

1185
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:28,039
neutral bodies and in the spaces to

1186
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,050
actually educate on it so like we had a

1187
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:32,059
County's cannabis conference last summer

1188
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:34,280
and that was very effective and I'd love

1189
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:36,380
to help you you know facilitate this

1190
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,240
meeting of the minds for the cannabis

1191
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,680
tax conversation for the cities but

1192
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:42,909
we're gonna have to somehow figure out

1193
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:42,909
how to pull that group together

1194
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:49,189
you can start though by just yeah but

1195
00:41:47,568 --> 00:41:51,858
you could start by coming up with like a

1196
00:41:49,188 --> 00:41:53,899
range of things that are reasonable talk

1197
00:41:51,858 --> 00:41:56,119
about you know output based taxes as

1198
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,769
opposed to square footage taxes I mean

1199
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:59,568
there's a lot of things but we still

1200
00:41:57,768 --> 00:42:01,488
gotta educate them on what those even

1201
00:41:59,568 --> 00:42:03,349
mean and so that's step one before you

1202
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:04,909
can start looking at restructuring the

1203
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:06,890
whole thing let's talk about what's

1204
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:09,018
working what's not and what's being done

1205
00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:11,958
around and we're an honest conversation

1206
00:42:09,018 --> 00:42:14,448
what's not working and so Joe what I was

1207
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:19,578
saying is you know these taxes are

1208
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:20,749
prescribed in prop 64 therefore you need

1209
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:23,539
to have to go to the ballot with a

1210
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:25,668
million dollars of signatures or get 2/3

1211
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:27,709
of the legislature to put it on the

1212
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:30,108
ballot and I think right now the

1213
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:31,848
appetite at the state level is people

1214
00:42:30,108 --> 00:42:33,498
understand that this is a problem so

1215
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:36,559
that's what I would advocate all of you

1216
00:42:33,498 --> 00:42:38,509
to do is go and educate your state

1217
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:41,479
assembly person and your state senator

1218
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:44,208
and talk about how these taxes perhaps

1219
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:48,588
are too high and it's really you know

1220
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:50,808
hampering this industry to explain why

1221
00:42:48,588 --> 00:42:53,208
it's actually a problem because it seems

1222
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:55,339
counterintuitive that high tax rates are

1223
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:57,588
not going to generate more revenue and I

1224
00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:59,208
sort of had to bury the City Council in

1225
00:42:57,588 --> 00:43:01,338
data and it's you know this happen in

1226
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:03,318
Washington State their taxes was way too

1227
00:43:01,338 --> 00:43:04,458
high they had a compounding effect and

1228
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:05,719
they had to lower it because they

1229
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:08,719
couldn't compete with the illicit market

1230
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:10,369
I mean ten percent of zero is zero if

1231
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,929
everybody's going to the illicit market

1232
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:13,548
so it really comes down to showing them

1233
00:43:11,929 --> 00:43:15,259
a lot of and I have a lot of data that I

1234
00:43:13,548 --> 00:43:17,208
put together this huge package just

1235
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:20,599
showing from all over and not just with

1236
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:22,248
cannabis but with other other products

1237
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:24,140
and commodities that you have to have

1238
00:43:22,248 --> 00:43:25,668
the right economic price point to be

1239
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:27,650
able to compete with the illicit market

1240
00:43:25,668 --> 00:43:29,658
and I agree with Fiona uniformity from

1241
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,009
the state down is going to be the best

1242
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:33,439
way to solve this problem because the

1243
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:35,028
patchwork of mosaic is is not working

1244
00:43:33,438 --> 00:43:37,668
for people and there's no way to

1245
00:43:35,028 --> 00:43:39,559
organize everybody in this industry and

1246
00:43:37,668 --> 00:43:41,509
in one voice because everybody's dealing

1247
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:43,339
with fractured different issues and so

1248
00:43:41,509 --> 00:43:45,798
it really is a state-level

1249
00:43:43,338 --> 00:43:47,478
issue at this point in my opinion oh and

1250
00:43:45,798 --> 00:43:50,650
I think you'd need data but also you

1251
00:43:47,478 --> 00:43:53,369
know what localities are successful and

1252
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:55,910
what their tax structure is

1253
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:58,109
and if we can have those leaders

1254
00:43:55,909 --> 00:44:00,059
highlighted then maybe others would

1255
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:02,940
follow instead of you know just like

1256
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:04,739
pulling a number out of thin air you're

1257
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,329
right though that it's a patchwork it's

1258
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:07,739
the League of Cities it should have

1259
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:10,049
never been done this way sixty-four was

1260
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:11,399
a brokered deal and the cities in South

1261
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:16,560
County should never have had this input

1262
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:18,269
that's why the state yeah and you know

1263
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,349
what you saying it's like I didn't want

1264
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:20,940
to get involved politically I've been

1265
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:22,710
out on my whole life ten years ago I got

1266
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,050
involved on a daily weekly basis in

1267
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:26,579
Mendocino County and I watched it make a

1268
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,170
difference in medicine oh and the small

1269
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:29,340
cities around there and those people

1270
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,480
listen when you go in there they're the

1271
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,670
same ten people that go to these

1272
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,679
Supervisors meetings in these notes

1273
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,300
council meetings so you have to get

1274
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:37,769
involved because they will listen to you

1275
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,470
and it will make a difference

1276
00:44:37,769 --> 00:44:41,789
hi I'm not sure if any of you can speak

1277
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,409
to this but I think something that's

1278
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:45,210
often underrepresented in the

1279
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:48,000
conversation about pain points is the

1280
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:50,639
influence of inaccuracy and

1281
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,769
inconsistency in testing and how that's

1282
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,599
being addressed with the BCC in a

1283
00:44:52,769 --> 00:44:58,259
Humboldt last week there was a motion to

1284
00:44:54,599 --> 00:45:00,239
put that in for standardized testing for

1285
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:03,360
all the labs and that was approved by

1286
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,189
the BCC there so that was an amazing

1287
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,920
moment to see because that's been a mess

1288
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:09,090
I get asked all the time where would you

1289
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,250
invest if you were going to invest in

1290
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:13,110
this industry and I have a policy of not

1291
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,849
investing with my clients and I always

1292
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:18,210
say right now there's a dearth of

1293
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:19,529
testing labs and and if you could invest

1294
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:21,869
in that I think there's something like

1295
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:24,510
40 that are licensed 22 that are active

1296
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:25,920
and 500 that are needed but who gets the

1297
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,840
testing the labs that get the highest

1298
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,430
THC ratings and the cannabinoids and

1299
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,430
stuff so they're all encouraged so

1300
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:35,789
fulfilling circle in that one other

1301
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,130
thing is this is something you have to

1302
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:39,779
be patient with so back in Colorado

1303
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,220
right this is the first time we're

1304
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,050
testing cannabis so they don't even know

1305
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:44,369
how best to test it for starters but

1306
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,860
they were actually trying to figure out

1307
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:48,420
how do we create a proficiency test to

1308
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,190
make sure that all the labs are coming

1309
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,530
up with the same test results on the

1310
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,059
same thing and I watched them spend 45

1311
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:56,820
minutes talking about okay if we have a

1312
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:58,739
slab of shatter how do we take the right

1313
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:01,320
piece so that we all have a consistent

1314
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:02,459
piece I mean 45 minutes 10 testing labs

1315
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,769
trying to figure how they would even

1316
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,740
take the part out of the slab that they

1317
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:06,909
would each have the same

1318
00:46:05,739 --> 00:46:08,469
to know that they were testing it to

1319
00:46:06,909 --> 00:46:10,929
figure out if they can test similarly

1320
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:13,419
it's gonna take time because this is

1321
00:46:10,929 --> 00:46:14,919
brand new and we need the scientists and

1322
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,659
whatnot to get involved and figure out

1323
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,710
how to even test that everyone is coming

1324
00:46:16,659 --> 00:46:21,389
up with the same results on the same

1325
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:24,280
item time we have another question

1326
00:46:21,389 --> 00:46:28,029
quickly I just got a slight shiver down

1327
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:30,610
my spine thinking about the track and

1328
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:33,130
trace and metric determining the good

1329
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:35,769
and bad players especially after having

1330
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:38,110
been up north going on a whole bunch of

1331
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:41,259
farms that are trying to implement with

1332
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:43,920
Sickler right now and then metric of

1333
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:46,750
course doesn't have a native

1334
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:50,200
distribution component I guess my

1335
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:53,320
question is what if it goes south is

1336
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:56,919
there a plan B if it goes south in

1337
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:59,559
California it could be problematic and

1338
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:04,659
the playing field could be even German

1339
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:08,049
wine wheat in the 80s that's Plan B no I

1340
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:10,599
don't think government has a plan B they

1341
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:12,580
just expect this to work so that's what

1342
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:15,549
I heard from Richard parrot who's the

1343
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:19,319
director of the track and trace program

1344
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:19,320
at the Department of Food and

1345
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:28,780
Agriculture I are in this industry I

1346
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:30,130
have a canned speech which I'll give a

1347
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,990
very short part of which is we are all

1348
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,010
pioneers in this industry and we all

1349
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:34,809
have to be held to a high standard

1350
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,190
because we know that there's a high

1351
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:39,130
level of scrutiny on what we're doing

1352
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:40,809
but as in any new industry we're going

1353
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:42,250
to learn from our mistakes we just have

1354
00:47:40,809 --> 00:47:43,659
to make sure we don't repeat the same

1355
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:45,400
mistakes and I think with track and

1356
00:47:43,659 --> 00:47:46,779
trade it's another example where we're

1357
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,010
gonna do some stuff that works and we're

1358
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,810
gonna find out some stuff that really

1359
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:52,240
doesn't work and it's gonna have to be

1360
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:54,190
fixed we are you know we are infants in

1361
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:55,750
this industry but I'll tell you this

1362
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,829
this is this is the the fuck kind of

1363
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:00,460
phone calls I'm getting now I'm getting

1364
00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:04,239
phone calls from New York Boston and

1365
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:06,250
Canada from people from pharmaceutical

1366
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:07,839
companies large tobacco companies large

1367
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,699
alcohol companies trying to figure out

1368
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,440
ways to start leveraging this market

1369
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:12,219
today so that when that five year term

1370
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,780
is up they can

1371
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:16,029
move in very very quickly it's very

1372
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:18,730
interesting as to the dynamics that I'm

1373
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:20,109
seeing behind the scenes from a from a

1374
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,550
legal perspective and how people are

1375
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:23,049
gearing up for this at this point and

1376
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:24,310
some people are shaking their head know

1377
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,280
some people are shaking their head yes

1378
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:28,869
you know it's it's it's just the nature

1379
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,060
of anything look at prohibition when it

1380
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:33,309
ended you went from moonshiners to Jim

1381
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:36,460
Beam but not everyone went became Jim

1382
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:38,529
Beam so it's it's gonna have this this

1383
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:41,230
the powerful effect on the industry and

1384
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:43,119
I think at looking at the at the future

1385
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:44,590
five years from now we're gonna be in

1386
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,910
this room and everyone's gonna be

1387
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:51,730
dressed more like me and less like the

1388
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:54,118
Swami that I saw in the back so it's

1389
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:55,858
yeah which is which is kind of sad

1390
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:59,230
actually

1391
00:48:55,858 --> 00:49:02,098
and I don't think we have any more

1392
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:06,190
questions but I want to thank Tim

1393
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:09,010
Sabrina Amanda and Fiona and you've got

1394
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:11,320
to go out and vote please we have a real

1395
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:14,240
voice for our industry going into the

1396
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:16,840
Treasury right now so please please vote

1397
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,839
