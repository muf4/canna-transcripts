1
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:07,839
[Music]

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,759
we'll just get started

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,400
okay hey everybody how's everybody doing

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,400
out there today

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,599
can you hear me in the back

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,839
all right y'all my name is joey berger

7
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,759
and uh we're gonna teach you two natural

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,359
farming inputs today

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,039
and this is from a system of farming

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,960
called jadam the book was up here

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,480
earlier it's not here anymore

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
but if you've heard of korean natural

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,879
farming this is a farming system

14
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,558
developed by the son of master cho the

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,280
founder of korean natural farming young

16
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:42,718
sencho and he took his dad's teachings

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,600
which are all about empowering the

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,079
farmer making farming simple

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,520
uh farming the way nature farms the way

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,439
nature builds soil and using plants to

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,160
make our own inputs our own fertilizers

22
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,799
our own pesticides and basically a way

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,799
to make the farmer

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,159
sufficient

25
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,319
empower them

26
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,079
give them their power back

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,199
these fertilizer companies they want to

28
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,239
make you feel dumb they want to make you

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,359
feel like you have to be a soil

30
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,519
scientist or you have to go to the

31
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,840
university you don't our ancestors

32
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,079
farmed very simply for eons

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,400
using plant plants and using human

34
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,438
manure and using animal manures very

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,719
simple ways of farming and

36
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,039
so

37
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,039
we love this jadom's type of farming

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,080
because it's very simple

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,000
the inputs we're going to teach you

40
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,599
today are so easy you're going to say i

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,920
can't believe i sat there and listened

42
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,919
to these guys talk about this so easy

43
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,679
and we like these inputs because they're

44
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,798
basically free

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,320
and

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,118
so what i'm going to teach you today is

47
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,559
called jms jadom microbial solution

48
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,560
and this is the one of the most

49
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,399
important inputs in this jadom natural

50
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,040
farming system because this is the way

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,640
to build the biology in the soil

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,118
the difference between dead dirt and

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,359
alive soil is the microbiology in the

54
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,118
soil microbes these are the invisible

55
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,519
workers there are billions of them under

56
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,878
there some are shredders and decomposers

57
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,598
a lot of them are are fixing nitrogen in

58
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,439
the soil making it available for plants

59
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,679
a lot of them are being uh eaten by

60
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,439
larger uh larger

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,719
critters of the soil and

62
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,479
they're they're being turned into

63
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,359
nitrogen as they go through their their

64
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,159
own gut microbiome

65
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,840
so

66
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,159
more than anything more than making

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,680
fertilizers more than making pesticides

68
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,120
the most important thing in natural

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,360
farming you should be looking at is how

70
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,280
to put the biology in your soil

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,519
and the different ways to do this are

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,719
this genome microbial solution

73
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,560
compost teas aerated compost teas and

74
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,039
compost tea extracts are another great

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,680
way to get that biology into your soil

76
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,199
and and you guys covered the imo process

77
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,719
a little bit in the last panel the

78
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,000
ferment cipher group talked about the

79
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,840
imo these are your indigenous

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,280
microorganisms this is a way to culture

81
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,840
microbes in the traditional korean

82
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,719
natural farming method

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,439
so

84
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,680
this jms we love it because it's easy it

85
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,878
can be made with water

86
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,120
a little bit of salt

87
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,158
a potato

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,000
and and a handful of microbes which is

89
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,079
this leaf mold soil that we're going to

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,318
gather deep in the forest i'm going to

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,800
take you guys deep into the untouched

92
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,958
forest here

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,159
where's my little pot

94
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,598
come with me

95
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:26,878
deep into the forest you have to get up

96
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,039
stay there

97
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,798
stay there i'm going deep

98
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,359
deep into the forest

99
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,760
picture that i'm going to the untouched

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,840
parts of the forest here oh look at this

101
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,199
oak trees over here so you're going to

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,719
want to pull back the

103
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:45,199
non-decomposed leaves

104
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,560
get get through that non-decomposed

105
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,560
layer of leaves you want to go to the

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,080
untouched areas of the forest where i

107
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,239
live the land's really steep it looks

108
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,000
like this so you go to a tree and you go

109
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,519
to that uphill side of the tree and the

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,120
leaves have been building up there for a

111
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,879
long time that's going to be the

112
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,000
thickest leaf mold so you're going to

113
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,438
pull back the non-decomposed leaves

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,799
and you're going to find those leaves

115
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,639
those breaking down leaves that are on

116
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,560
top of the soil we call this leaf mold

117
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,000
soil and the microbes from the soil are

118
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,400
starting to break that down a lot of

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,719
them are shredders and decomposers and

120
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,840
they're literally in there breaking that

121
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,519
down

122
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,199
and and to find the best stuff you want

123
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,759
to look for these white strands of

124
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,280
mycelium oh this is a jackpot you guys

125
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,080
you would have thought i planted this

126
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,638
over here for this demo but you want to

127
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,959
look for the white that white

128
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,519
that white mycelium

129
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,560
and these are huge colonies of fungi and

130
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,240
bacteria these strands of mycelium they

131
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,478
connect these plants these trees

132
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,560
underground and they can share nutrients

133
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,478
they can warn each other of pests and

134
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,800
passions pathogens so they can prepare

135
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,240
their defenses

136
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,520
so i'm gonna i'm gonna bring this out

137
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,040
here and show it to anybody that wants

138
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,799
to see this

139
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,040
the white stuff you know about this

140
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,400
right these are your decomposers your

141
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,040
shredders

142
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,560
your fungi and your bacteria right here

143
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,400
and so we're going to use this these are

144
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,800
our indigenous microorganisms we just

145
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,799
collected them they thrive here at this

146
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,800
temperature at this elevation this is

147
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,960
their home they know how to turn that

148
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,120
leaf into soil

149
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,198
that's their job so we're going to use

150
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,560
just a little tiny bit of that

151
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,000
i got i'd like to introduce you to my

152
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,000
friend r2d2 right here

153
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,600
this is a five gallon bucket it's maybe

154
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,478
a little bigger is this a seven gallon

155
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
bucket

156
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,959
this is the bucket that we use at home

157
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,478
to make jms and uh the jedom liquid

158
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,519
fertilizer and we do our feedings

159
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,279
through this bucket with a dosatron

160
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,719
so you've got your five gallons of water

161
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,638
i already filled it up because ain't

162
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,120
nobody got time for that

163
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,918
and we're going to

164
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,560
take

165
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,839
three ingredients salt potatoes and this

166
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,759
leaf mold

167
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,359
the first ingredient is going to be 25

168
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,879
grams of salt

169
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,720
i weighed this out already i hope i

170
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,399
didn't mix these jars for the weekend up

171
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,720
but we'll see

172
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,918
we're going to pour this in here now

173
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,919
you can use sea salt

174
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,839
or you can go to the ocean and gather

175
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,360
sea water

176
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,719
we're going to dissolve this in here

177
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,479
stirring it with a wooden stick you

178
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,080
don't want to use metal when you're

179
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,240
working with microbes they don't like

180
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,240
they don't react well with microbes so

181
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,319
i'm just dissolving this this sea this

182
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,079
sea salt in there when we go to the

183
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,240
ocean to gather the sea water we'll take

184
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,839
a bucket we'll wade out into the ocean

185
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,759
and you want to gather from those top

186
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,758
three inches so we'll just skim from the

187
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,720
top of the water that's where the most

188
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,520
uh diversity of aquatic microorganisms

189
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,000
are

190
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,758
is is where that uh that where that

191
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,160
water meets the air wherever you've got

192
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,240
an edge you've got the most diversity

193
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,000
you also want to gather that water near

194
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,600
the brackish waters where the river

195
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,279
enters the ocean you're going to get

196
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,120
even more diversity of microbes if you

197
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,959
can gather that water

198
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,639
so if you bring that salt water home

199
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,239
open that bucket up or that container

200
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,038
let it breathe overnight some of that

201
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,960
salt to burn off

202
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,120
and then you can use that sea water to

203
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,638
mix it in here did anybody

204
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,319
download the sop this week

205
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,199
we usually we bring them with and hand

206
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,840

215
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,079
material list here five gallon food

216

grade bucket

217
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,800
we're going to skip the dilution tank

218
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,759
because we're not going to cover that

219
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,680
right now

220
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,598

221
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,519
there it is right there

222
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,719
that little that little tiny potato

223
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,318
let's see what that weighs

224
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,360
96 grams

225
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,120
you can i'm going to use this whole

226
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,280
potato you can use more potato than you

227
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,000
want basically this potato is going to

228
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,839
be a food source for these microbes

229
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,680
they're going to be multiplying in this

230
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,439
water

231
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
and this water is going to tell us when

232
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,199
it's all done it's going to tell us when

233
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,000
these microbes are at their peak growth

234
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,160
so i'm going to take this potato

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,759
and i'm going to take this salt

236
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,280
i'm going to stuff this potato in this

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,639
little easier to bust up this uh

245
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,199

okay

269
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,278
50 grams of boiled potato we went over

270
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:31,519
but the easy way to remember is 50 grams

271
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:34,720
of potato 25 grams of sea salt 25 grams

272
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,320
of leaf mold which is very little

273
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,920
so i've got my sock i'm going to show

274
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,920
you how little that leaf mold is

275
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,720
that's 16 grams

276
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,759
that's

277
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:55,040
21. use very little you're going to see

278
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,879
we're using just a small handful of this

279
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,958
there's our 20

280
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,360
25 grams

281
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,838
that's 26.8

282
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,278
so you can see it's a handful that's it

283
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,480
we're gonna use that's that's the whole

284
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,000
thing we're gonna use for this five

285
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,759
gallons right here

286
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,600
give it up for my lovely assistant here

287
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,679
she's gonna stuff this leaf mold in this

288
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,360
sock

289
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,599
it's in there already

290
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,560
oh this is a two two-man job okay this

291
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,560
is the erotic part

292
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,680
don't don't watch you guys don't watch

293
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,159
this part

294
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:32,078
okay

295
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:35,919
you wanna tie that off for me please

296
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,919
get it out of your hair please okay

297
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,120
okay so now

298
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,720
we've got

299
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,639
our sock

300
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,920
with our potato

301
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,319
with our leaf mold in it

302
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:54,000
and if we were going to culture crop

303
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,360
specific microbes say for like cannabis

304
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
at this point we would go and grab a

305
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,440
couple of leaves off of that cannabis

306
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
plant we'd throw them in this sock also

307
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,880
because you're now you're going to

308
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,720
encourage microbes that like cannabis to

309
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,879
get in there and start cultivating to

310
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,160
start inoculating this so

311
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,078
if you're growing if you're growing

312
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,759
tomatoes throw a couple little leaves of

313
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,278
the tomato plant in there if you're

314
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,039
growing potatoes grow a couple little

315
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,480
leaves of the potato in there if you're

316
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,319
growing cannabis throw a handful of

317
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,240
ganja in there just the leaf just the

318
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
veg leaf will be fine

319
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,560
um

320
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,560
so i got my sock

321
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,000
and we've got

322
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,360
our bamboo stick we already

323
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,360
we already watered this in

324
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,159
what's nice about the jms too is like

325
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,078
once you do it enough that you'll get

326
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,838
those measurements in your head and then

327
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,599
you don't even have there's no need

328
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,839
after a while to measure like especially

329
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,600
your leaf mold just go grab a handful

330
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,240
and it's not like and then if you get

331
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,839
too much if that's okay it's no big deal

332
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,480
the same thing with the potato if you

333
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,680
get too much it's okay the one thing to

334
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,079
be really um consistent with is your

335
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,000
salt water your either your sea water or

336
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,399
your salt to make sure that that is like

337
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,639
really exact but the rest

338
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,639
it's okay

339
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,919
yeah seawater has 93 uh micro

340
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,159
micronutrients in it minerals so

341
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,519
seawater is very good for your garden

342
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,278
you want to work that into your garden

343
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,639
where you can it's a free input not that

344
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,519
close to the ocean here but it's worth

345
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,519
the drive to the coast

346
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,039
so we've got our sock in there now what

347
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,480
i'm going to do is i'm going to massage

348
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,078
this into this water i'm going to

349
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,839
massage that potato remember we put

350
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,679
those sharp rocks in there that's going

351
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,279
to help break that potato up i'm going

352
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,000
to massage the leaf mold i'm going to

353
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,600
massage the microbes out of that sock

354
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,278
into the water

355
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,079
and tomorrow's going to hold the

356
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,078
microphone for me

357
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,360
work it yeah do it

358
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,320
so

359
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,319
the one thing you got to make sure is

360
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,160
you need warmer water when you're doing

361
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,639
this this won't work if your temps are

362
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,039
under 64 degrees i've made three of

363
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,879
these this spring already my first two

364
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,639
were great slam dunk but we were having

365
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,799
hot weather and my last one that i made

366
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,799
about a week ago during that cold snap

367
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,719
total fail i even started it in the

368
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,958
greenhouse where it'd be a little warmer

369
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,480
it wasn't warm enough

370
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,159
if your water is really cold and it's

371
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,399
underground fill up your back fill up

372
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,039
your bucket the day before so that water

373
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,679
will sit out be a little warmer

374
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,679
sometimes i will cheat and use the warm

375
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,599
water from the hose that's been sitting

376
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,198
in the sun if i know this water's really

377
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,278
cold i'll heat it up you know put a

378
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,359
little bit of that in there

379
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,159
in hot warm weather this is going to be

380
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,159
done in 24 hours we're in lake county

381
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,480
it's hot there in the summer

382
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,319
it can be done really fast cold weather

383
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,320
those first ones i made in february and

384
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,040
march they took about a week they could

385
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,360
take up to five days seven days

386
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,198
when you make this in hot weather

387
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,959
you're going to get a lot of big bubbles

388
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,198
and when you make this in cold weather

389
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,879
you're going to get small bubbles and

390
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,479
what i'm talking about there is how we

391
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,838
know this is done how we know this is at

392
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,320
its peak microbial

393
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,320
growth uh

394
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,680
i'm going to massage this in here

395
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,600
i can feel this potato getting all

396
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,679
broken up i can feel the leaf mold this

397
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,519
water's looking a little grayer

398
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,479
i've rigged i rigged this up with a

399
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,560
bamboo steak so this will uh sit right

400
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,159
in the middle this this uh

401
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,159
this bucket

402
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,120
and the vortex of microbes that you want

403
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,799
to hang in the middle because there's a

404
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,000
whole vortex of microbes that happens

405
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,240
there and they're able to multiply

406
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,320
faster if this is in the center and also

407
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,320
the way you know this is done is you're

408
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,000
going to get tiny bubbles are going to

409
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,680
start coming up around the edges that's

410
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,720
where you're first going to notice them

411
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,719
and then these bubbles are going to get

412
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,959
bigger they're get more vigorous and

413
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,879
when this is at its peak growth is when

414
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,439
the whole top of this is covered with

415
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,559
bubbles a solid pizza is what we like to

416
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,480
say

417
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,638
and um

418
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,879
and you have about a 12-hour window when

419
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,159
it's at its peak growth so in hot

420
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,078
weather you'll check it in the morning

421
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,360
be like oh it's not done and then it's

422
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,198
you didn't check it in the evening it's

423
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,879
done it's over the hill the next morning

424
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,399
the way you know it's over the hill is

425
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,159
the bubbles will have started to break

426
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,320
up they'll start pulling away from the

427
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,439
sides of the bucket and those bubbles

428
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,199
will start breaking up those are your

429
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,959
microbes starting to die off they've

430
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,958
reached their peak growth and they're

431
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,479
dying off you can still use this as a

432
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,638
liquid fertilizer at that point you

433
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,480
could still dilute it and use it but

434
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,159
it's not going to have the the diversity

435
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,039
of microbial life in there that we're

436
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,039
really looking for

437
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,519
so yeah when this is at full pizza shell

438
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,039
i know when it's done that's why we

439
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,360
prefer this over doing an aerated

440
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,799
compost tea where you have to brew it at

441
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,800
a certain temperature in a certain

442
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,559
length of time and you need to scope it

443
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:49,758
to make sure it has the life in it this

444
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,518
is telling me when it's at its peak

445
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,519
growth that's why we like it that's why

446
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,198
it's this is so available for any farmer

447
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,480
to do this on their farm you saw what we

448
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,559
used here today anybody got a five

449
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,240
gallon bucket at their farm

450
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,239
okay you guys are well on your way to be

451
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,639
natural farmers you already got the

452
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,399
basics you know the essentials

453
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,879
um

454
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,240
so yeah we massaged that in there i'm

455
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,000
just going to run through the sop for

456
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,399
you guys a little bit

457
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,399
um

458
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,360
at this point you're going to loosely

459
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,198
cover this with your lid and just leave

460
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,039
it in the center of your garden in the

461
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,000
sun and this is you want it in the

462
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,519
garden where you're going to use it

463
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,120
because the microbes that are there that

464
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,039
are present are going to start culturing

465
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,240
they're going to start multiplying you

466
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,000
know these are your indigenous

467
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,079
microorganisms you want to capture them

468
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,679
use those ones

469
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,838
yeah if your water temperatures get too

470
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,599
low you can put a water heater in this a

471
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,279
little like aquarium water heater and

472
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,240
heat it up that's all easy way to do

473
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,519
these in the winter time

474
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,320
um

475
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,078
when we go to feed this

476
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,399
we will dilute this if we're if we're

477
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,479
feeding empty beds that aren't planted

478
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,480
no plants in them we'll dilute this 10

479
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,800
times into into water so this will make

480
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,720
50 gallons this five gallons i put into

481
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,559
a 50 gallon drum of water and then feed

482
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,798
that if i'm pumping it through drip

483
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,318
systems or hoses i flush those lines for

484
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,318
a good five minutes with clean water

485
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,399
afterwards you'll get microbial buildup

486
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,639
in there and things can get gross so

487
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,559
flush those lines

488
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,799
if we're if i'm watering beds that are

489
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,318
planted or nursery plants stuffed with

490
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,000
the gongz in it right now i'm diluting

491
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,720
it at 20 to 1.

492
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,959
no no nothing no um no plants in the

493
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,558
soil 10 to 1. so this would make 100

494
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,199
gallons i fill up that 50 gallon barrel

495
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,199
twice with it

496
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,480
if you're going to

497
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,480
move this with a pump

498
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,360
low pressure pumps are better

499
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,558
diaphragm pumps are best and if you

500
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,678
start pumping anything with high

501
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,200
pressure it's going to shred your

502
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,720
bacteria and your fungi and start

503
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,880
beating your microbes up and kill them

504
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,558
so

505
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,160
pumping them one time through a low

506
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,240
pressure pump in your drip system or

507
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,840
into your dilution tank not a big deal

508
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,279
don't use those pumps to aerate these

509
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,279
things you're just going to shred them

510
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,839
get it get a low pressure diaphragm pump

511
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,720
if you can

512
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,038
um

513
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,120
when we go to feed this this also mixes

514
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,119
well with the jadom liquid fertilizers

515
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,798
that tamara is going to teach you next

516
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,479
so i will i will combine the liquid

517
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,319
fertilizers into a feeding at the same

518
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,079
time that i'm doing these microbes but

519
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,319
really this is the most important thing

520
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,678
in our system if we have enough biology

521
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,798
and good microbes in our soil we don't

522
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,720
need to feed as much we don't need to

523
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,038
fertilize as much we don't need to water

524
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,798
as much

525
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,000
this is why the forest functions the

526
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,000
forest doesn't need to be watered it

527
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,919
doesn't be fertilized this soil is full

528
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,160
of microbial life that's performing its

529
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,440
functions and when that's vacant is when

530
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,840
you need to is when you start having the

531
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,080
pests and the pathogens come in

532
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,599
when there's good biology in the soil we

533
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,199
say there is no good and bad you just

534
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,959
have a healthy balance it's only when

535
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,200
things get out of balance that do any of

536
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,279
these things become a pest or a pathogen

537
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,360
they're all present all the time but we

538
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,279
need them in balance so when we do

539
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,119
farming that mimics nature these natural

540
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,440
practices a lot easier to stay in

541
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,519
balance with everything

542
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,679
so

543
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,558
uh when i'm done i'll also wash out my

544
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,919
sock i rinse out my sock i use a 100

545
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,359
cotton sock because the microbes will

546
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,200
actually break this stuff down so don't

547
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:11,279
use like a a

548
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,200
synthetic sock or anything

549
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,960
it's best to apply this in the evening

550
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,360
to your soil this way your soil will

551
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,759
stay moist longer you want those

552
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:22,000
microbes to be able to get a foothold so

553
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,319
water in the evening or even better

554
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,160
water before a rain and then the rain

555
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,759
will water it down in the soil take it

556
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,440
deep down into the soil that's what you

557
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,679
want

558
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,000
this stuff is so safe and so beneficial

559
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,440
you could do it with every watering

560
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,279
every single watering if you did at

561
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,840
those dilution rates

562
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,918
we try to do it at least once a week or

563
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,839
at least every other week and when we do

564
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,919
that we're alternating the other week

565
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,119
with a compost tea ex with a compost

566
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,720
extract which you'll probably talk about

567
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,959
that to you

568
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,720
and it that's a very simple easy way to

569
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,240
get some biology in your soil so we're

570
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,558
just making sure that every week we're

571
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,240
adding a different set of biology our

572
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,319
soil diversity you hear us talk about

573
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,120
diversity a lot we want a diverse set of

574
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,119
microbes so

575
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,319
uh you guys just just heard the biochar

576
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,120
talk over here we've used this jms to

577
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,439
charge biochar also once you make that

578
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,918
biochar you need to get the microbes up

579
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,240
into it to establish jms is a great way

580
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,400
to do that we've made big windrows five

581
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,798
you know six feet wide five feet tall

582
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,200
i did this at a farm last year we got 80

583
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:28,319
yards of biochar that we had to charge

584
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,038
and we used jms and we used pond water

585
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,798
that was full of aquatic microorganisms

586
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,679
and we used the compost tea and we used

587
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,599
genome liquid fertilizers but

588
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,679
at the very least you guys you should

589
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,038
apply this to your to your soil three

590
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,440
times a year

591
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:44,640
once in the springtime before you plant

592
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,679
which should be at that ten to one

593
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,400
dilution

594
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,559
once uh before you go into flowering

595
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,559
during transition time as you're going

596
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:55,519
from veg into flower if you're going

597
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:57,119
full term that's you know end of july

598
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:58,960
somewhere in there

599
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,918
uh at least over by us probably same

600
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,079
here

601
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,919
and then once again before you put your

602
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,359
beds away for the season once again

603
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,400
before the winter rains come or right

604
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,798
before that winter rain comes so

605
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,880
i hope you guys learned some things here

606
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,038
this stuff is very simple

607
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,919
uh when we make this in a 50 gallon drum

608
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:20,000
we do a pound of potatoes a half pound

609
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,759
of sea salt and a half pound of leaf

610
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,279
mold i mean those are some really easy

611
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,519
numbers to remember

612
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,279
you can still go online on my patreon at

613
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,119
the link on my bio at the humboldt local

614
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,359
2.0 on instagram there's a link there to

615
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,558
my patreon you can download these sops

616
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:37,038
for free there so please go grab those

617
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,519
and let us know yeah anybody got any

618
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:39,519
questions

619
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,159
say again

620
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:51,918
i live over in lake county

621
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,919
oh yeah yeah we live in middletown

622
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,679
come to the farmers market

623
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,600
what's up

624
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,960
cold water is the biggest one a lot of

625
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,000
people are messaging me right now

626
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,880
they're trying to make them in this

627
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,960
springtime weather it's just too cold um

628
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,520
yeah that water needs to be 64 68.

629
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,759
i would either either fill this bucket

630
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,279
up ahead of time the day before let it

631
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,359
sit out

632
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,359
black plastic could be good

633
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,279
oh yeah so this is why this looks like

634
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,119
r2d2 i wrapped this reflective

635
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,519
insulation around this you guys could

636
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,439
wrap a blanket around it would help

637
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,200
anything like that would help insulate

638
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,798
this bucket bring it in your greenhouse

639
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,720
if you got really cold weather you know

640
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,759
that's what we did for a few days

641
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,279
um yeah great question trent yeah

642
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,960
anybody else before i turn this over to

643
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,240
tomorrow

644
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,000
tomorrow's going to talk a little bit

645
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,079
about this as well because these two

646
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,599
inputs really tie in well together so

647
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,918
i'd like to introduce tamara thorne

648
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,519
owner of heal thyself gardens a dem pure

649
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,280
certified farmer

650
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,319
and my sweetheart

651
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,158
and she's going to talk to you about

652
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,798
jadam liquid fertilizer give it up for

653
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,799
tomorrow y'all

654
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,720
awesome thank you

655
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,798
joey um yeah so a couple things i want

656
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,798
to mention on the jms is like because

657
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:28,639
you all over here in grass valley north

658
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,319
san juan are very similar to our growing

659
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,880
environment that we have in lake county

660
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:36,000
it's really hot so

661
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,440
we said 24 hours sometimes i've noticed

662
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,599
on 100 degree days 104 degree days it's

663
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,080
like 12 hours so

664
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,399
check it because i have had that happen

665
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,399
before and that's those are really like

666
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,080
it's kind of rare but that's like it has

667
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,840
happened so just kind of check them on

668
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,960
those really hot days

669
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,720
um

670
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,558
and this is i don't know if any of y'all

671
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,240
know what sea green is y'all remember

672
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:00,558
y'all know that stuff

673
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,960
yeah well this would replace your sea

674
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,639
green like this is what like when i

675
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,319
first found out about this i kind of

676
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,038
like blew my mind because i was paying

677
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,798
800 a bucket for sea green and i was

678
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:12,798
understanding what they was trying to do

679
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,879
like this microbial life

680
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:17,599
but then i started understanding like

681
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,440
once i learned how to do this

682
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,519
then i realized that probably all that

683
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,720
stuff i've been feeding my plants out of

684
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,720
that bottle really wasn't alive

685
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,960
and probably had already died because if

686
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,278
you're taking microbes from another

687
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,840
environment especially from the sea and

688
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:36,000
stuff and you're bringing into your

689
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,678
dry environment it's not the same

690
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,240
microbes so they're going to die off

691
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,000
really fast and if they don't they could

692
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,759
start attacking your your ones that are

693
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,278
there and that's not what you want you

694
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,480
want your native um indigenous

695
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:49,839
microorganisms to be in your garden

696
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,798
because that's how your garden's gonna

697
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,639
thrive

698
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,720
so those are some things to be aware of

699
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,200
and how like when i found out about this

700
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,440
like it was pennies compared to those

701
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,960
buckets i was buying i mean it was it

702
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,278
was yeah i couldn't even believe it

703
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,360
but we love this stuff it's amazing and

704
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,440
you just do it you know once you do it

705
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,678
over and over it becomes really routine

706
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,519
and it's super easy and then you get the

707
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,600
hang of it and you start realizing your

708
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,440
temperatures and how to you know you

709
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,599
just do it more practice makes perfect

710
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,679
but they're really simple

711
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,000
um the one i'm going to talk about is

712
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,080
the jadom liquid fertilizer

713
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,640
and this is your liquid fertilizer that

714
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,079
you can make with plant material animal

715
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,960
wastes

716
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,240
um

717
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,079
also it when just water and leaf mold

718
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,079
so your first thing that you're going to

719
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,240
do like what i've got in this bucket is

720
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,240
your five gallon bucket

721
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,839
you need some plant material we're going

722
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,159
to talk about plant material first and

723
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,199
then i'll go into the animal manures

724
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,880
um

725
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,440
and so you get your plant material

726
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,960
you're going to harvest a bucket full

727
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,200
and i didn't finish the bucket because i

728
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,278
wanted to show y'all what i like to do

729
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,200
um so some of these pieces too like when

730
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,038
i'm harvesting you see how these are

731
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,080
dried i just kind of take those out

732
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:03,519
because you know we're looking for

733
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,839
nutrients so that's something when

734
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,960
you're looking for your plant material

735
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,599
to harvest

736
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,679
you want it to be alive and fresh and

737
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,519
look really you know healthy

738
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,278
um

739
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,558
so we're gonna take off some of that

740
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,079
right there

741
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,879
and then you're just gonna cut like your

742
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:23,199
plant material into about like i'd

743
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,039
do two to four inches

744
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,679
and

745
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:27,679
yeah sure

746
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:34,158
just doing two to four inches here

747
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,080
just cut and so i usually just harvest

748
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,600
and then if that's anything that's dried

749
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,839
i'll just cut off

750
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,558
and just do it directly into the bucket

751
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,240
i really like to not have so many steps

752
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:45,839
so if i can just harvest and then just

753
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,798
put it directly into the bucket makes it

754
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,798
easier

755
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,798
and so then you want to fill your bucket

756
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,879
up to where like i've tried to fill this

757
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,960
all the way full and then where when i

758
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,720
press my hand down it's still hot like

759
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,720
it's still there you know there's not

760
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,519
much give

761
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,319
and so after this is filled then you

762
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,319
just fill it with water

763
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,240
and

764
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:11,440
leaf mold

765
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,720
and that's it

766
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,440
so we're going to put this leaf mold

767
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,440
over the top

768
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,240
now

769
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,360
if i had some water over here then we'd

770
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,359
put water over it put a lid on it and

771
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,119
boom you just put that in your garden

772
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:29,439
and that's it that is your liquid

773
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:32,239
fertilizer and so on the plant material

774
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,679
i know we have it on our on the sops if

775
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,599
you downloaded there's a few different

776
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,840
things about the plants

777
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,839
um

778
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,599
not too much on here though

779
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,240
but like right now what i went and did

780
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:47,599
is i did a grass jlf

781
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,359
yeah and the grass jlf is going to be

782
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,439
for your veg

783
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,759
and so what i went and harvested is

784
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,919
anything that was still vegging like

785
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,519
anything that was like already flowering

786
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,038
these grasses over here i kind of had to

787
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,158
go search because some of these are all

788
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,079
flowering

789
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,480
about to go to seed and so those would

790
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,639
be really good during transition or

791
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,038
flowering fruiting times

792
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,440
so the grasses i went and got i had to

793
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,359
um hunt down some miners lettuce and

794
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,038
just some of the other taller grasses

795
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,398
which is nice because you want stuff

796
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,079
that's like have a lot of growth

797
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,079
hormones

798
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,079
so i wouldn't got the taller grasses

799
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,720
nothing that's gone to seed

800
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:27,038
and then this jlf if we make this now

801
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,960
we'll be ready in about 10 days

802
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,359
and that that's going to be filled with

803
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,200
nitrogen it's also going to be filled

804
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,199
with any of these micronutrients from

805
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,000
the soil that's here

806
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,960
um but this is a really basic one we can

807
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,880
get a little bit like more in depth like

808
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,200
you start knowing your plants you know

809
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,120
your nettle your nettle has a lot it's

810
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,759
very high in nitrogen you also have

811
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,839
calcium iron magnesium it has a lot of

812
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,599
nutrients in it so

813
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,879
every year i like to get like a 50

814
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:58,558
gallon

815
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,480
barrel of it made and just do all nettle

816
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,480
because that nettle is really good

817
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,880
during veg

818
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,960
and then also

819
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,600
you're comfrey comfrey's another high

820
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,000
one in nitrogen so all comfrey one

821
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,119
borage borage is i think it's potassium

822
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,839
for that one

823
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,599
so

824
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,519
they're in transition they're so it's

825
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,480
like you know in your plants

826
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,119
what

827
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,679
is in those plants and kind of do some

828
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:26,798
research into that because like borage

829
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,798
and mugwort high in potassium

830
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:31,119
that's really good during transition

831
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,960
time

832
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,199
then we have like anything that's

833
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,440
fruiting or flowering is really good

834
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,240
during of course flowering and fruiting

835
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,120
time so any of your apples coming out

836
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,798
any of your fruit trees blackberries

837
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,798
um

838
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,558
you know just anything that's fruit and

839
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,038
flowering we do a lot of sunflowers

840
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:53,359
sunflowers are really high in phosphorus

841
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,839
so when they're all like in their flower

842
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,199
set about to go to seed to harvest them

843
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,599
and put them in your

844
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,519
buckets or barrels

845
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:04,519
that's a really good one

846
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,519
um

847
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,960
other pla at all parts really like the

848
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,719
the veg time it's gonna be just anything

849
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,399
that's veggie but it's the whole plant

850
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,159
except for the roots we leave the roots

851
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,038
so it can kind of come back

852
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,799
um

853
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,359
but like if it but then once it's

854
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,798
flowering you're wanting to take it like

855
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,158
if these all these grasses start

856
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:31,519
flowering like i'm saying here right

857
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,360
here now this is good because it's not

858
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,679
seeded yet so this would be good during

859
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,278
transition once it's seeded then it's

860
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,840
really good during flowering and

861
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,679
fruiting time and so any of your flowers

862
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,398
you can start gathering spring flowers

863
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,759
now too that can go in for your um

864
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:47,199
flower teas

865
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,000
so let's see

866
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,640
and

867
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,960
i'm thinking about some others yes

868
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,679
cannabis of course we

869
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,319
prune i prove like one of our big prunes

870
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,159
we do is during transition and so of

871
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,240
course it's the best tea during

872
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,399
transition we immediately you know we go

873
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,798
inside and clean out those girls

874
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,158
and you have at least a 50 gallon bag it

875
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,720
depends on how many plants you got at

876
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,480
least a five gallon bucket of all that

877
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,558
and then that's we just turn that into a

878
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,759
jlf you know fill that up with water put

879
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,599
the leaf mold on it and ten to 10 days

880
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,839
it's ready to go

881
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,000
um anything and it's like that with any

882
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,639
of your anything that you are growing if

883
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,359
that's tomatoes if that's peas it's

884
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,720
squash that plant is gonna be the best

885
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:34,398
thing to feed it so squash is great to

886
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,240
feedback to squash

887
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:37,839
cannabis back to cannabis you know it

888
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,839
just goes like that because that plant

889
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,639
has everything the nutritional needs

890
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,000
that that plant needs to grow

891
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,679
um

892
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,319
horsetail horsetail just went and

893
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,240
harvested really high in silica that's

894
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,558
really good for structural support of

895
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,720
your plants so i like to add that in

896
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,879
like pretty much through at owl and it's

897
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,278
another one too that that's another

898
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,039
thing we teach to make is a um

899
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,839
herbal solution that we make out of the

900
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,679
horsetail which is really good for pm

901
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,000
so horsetail is amazing like if you can

902
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,320
find a good horsetail spot go harvest

903
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,240
because it's also good for you too

904
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,240
nettle and horsetail are two of the best

905
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,960
things for our plants but also to the

906
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,359
best things for us also because it's had

907
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,440
so many minerals and vitamins and silica

908
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,558
it's just like packed full of nutrients

909
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,558
that we need as well

910
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,158
so that's the thing with the plants i

911
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,919
mean it's really you can use your

912
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,440
intuition with if you see something

913
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:35,600
flowering like um milk thistle is really

914
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,919
nice right now before it flowers use it

915
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:39,918
for veg it's just filled with nutrients

916
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,559
plus it has growth hormones that stuff

917
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,120
is powerful you know you look at those

918
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,038
plants see like how fast does it grow if

919
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,518
it's growing really fast take that

920
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,278
that's growth like hormones in there

921
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,919
um the milk thistle once it starts

922
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:57,038
flowering great for flower tea

923
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,600
um let's see and then with your animal

924
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:02,319
manures those of course we're really

925
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,558
great for nitrogen i like to do my

926
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,480
strike i tell like a nitrogen shot is

927
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,798
what i do with the chicken manure so

928
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,558
i'll fill either a 50 gallon barrel up

929
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:11,759
or a five gallon bucket depending on how

930
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:13,839
much i have

931
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,398
and i love to start the year with like a

932
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,639
50 gallon barrel of chicken manure

933
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,319
and then we just fill that up and i'm

934
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,480
not and

935
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:25,278
you don't need to fill it all the way up

936
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,000
for the manures the manures you're gonna

937
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:30,240
do about like i do about a third of the

938
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,679
bucket for the manures

939
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,120
and sometimes that's a little much

940
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,120
sometimes you can do about a fourth but

941
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,518
a third i feel like it gets a good

942
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:40,079
strength on there and the same thing

943
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,278
fill it up with water put your leaf mold

944
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,240
and

945
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:47,519
then wait for about 10 days

946
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,440
and one thing to know if your jlfs are

947
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,440
really stinky because they will they'll

948
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,640
become smelly and you're like oh my god

949
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,558
is this thing rancid yes it is

950
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,519
but it's okay it's supposed to be that

951
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,519
way um but if it gets too smelly for you

952
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,440
we're just like i can't take this put

953
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,359
some more leaf mold in it or some

954
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,880
mushrooms i've even used mushrooms that

955
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,199
have gone bad out of the fridge and just

956
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,878
stuck mushrooms in it and it seems to

957
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,078
like really start breaking it down

958
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:15,838
faster and the smell goes away

959
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,119
so that's just a little tidbit i found

960
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:18,960
out

961
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,280
um trial and error

962
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,599
and uh

963
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,599
let's see and so you can also use some

964
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,320
of your stuff you'd use for top

965
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,079
dressings like kelp or oyster shell

966
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,359
and you would do the same thing you'd do

967
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,599
with the animal manures do about a third

968
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,358
to fourth down the bucket and then same

969
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,480
thing again fill up with water in your

970
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:40,799
leaf mold

971
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,280
and you're gonna want those to be in the

972
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,919
same temperature like with your jms you

973
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,599
want that right by your garden where it

974
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,440
all the microbes everything's breaking

975
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,679
down at the same temperature that your

976
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,918
garden's at so we're brewing all those

977
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,240
microbes that we want

978
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,838
and um

979
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,319
yeah i mean we go through this to make

980
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,960
sure another oh another really good one

981
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,359
is blackberry go get that blackberry you

982
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,240
know it's overtaking all of our places

983
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:11,039
and it's really good it's another growth

984
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:13,358
stimulant like that stuff is powerful it

985
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,719
can break through anything and it grits

986
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:17,279
it's strong

987
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,279
so put feed that to your plants that

988
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,000
right there when it's vegging that's a

989
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,240
great veg it also when it is fruiting

990
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,800
but not ready yet

991
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,879
take that for transition so any of your

992
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,599
fruits that are unripe that's another

993
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,960
thing to use during transition

994
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,960
and then of course the blackberry you

995
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,320
can use when it's all the way fruited so

996
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,159
that one's really nice you can kind of

997
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,800
use it through all stages and it's

998
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:40,799
really helpful

999
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:48,239
and we're going to take these and we

1000
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:48,239
usually use these at about a 30 to a 1.

1001
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,880
this one's our the grass we usually do

1002
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,639
about a 20 to a 1 just depends on how

1003
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,920
much nutrients are in the things you're

1004
00:35:54,639 --> 00:36:00,239
doing but usually my gauge is about a 30

1005
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,240
to a 1 on everything

1006
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,719
and the things with these

1007
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:07,199
liquid fertilizers is that they don't go

1008
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:09,519
bad they'll just get stronger

1009
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,199
so if you've had one and it's over a

1010
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,199
year then you're going to instead of

1011
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,879
doing a 30 to 1 you're going to do 60 to

1012
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,399
1 because it's going to be stronger and

1013
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,160
so every year you're going to cut it

1014
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,200
down a little bit more depending on how

1015
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,199
long they've been brewing

1016
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:24,400
um

1017
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,320
what else am i missing anything

1018
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,000
in natural farming we have what is

1019
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,079
called the nutritive cycle theory and

1020
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,760
that's what tomorrow is talking about

1021
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:37,039
fast growing leafy green shoots for veg

1022
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,920
unripe fruits and flowers for transition

1023
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:42,800
and ripe fruits flowers and buds for

1024
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,400
fruiting and flowering it's very simple

1025
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,320
so these inputs are important to make

1026
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,639
seasonally we go out right now while

1027
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,160
things are in veg we go out and gather

1028
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,838
the miners lettuce we go out and gather

1029
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,838
the dead nettle that was only out for a

1030
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,759
little while the horsetail is just now

1031
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:57,119
starting to pop get out in the forest

1032
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,480
and start to know your land start to

1033
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,680
know what these plants are seasonally

1034
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,519
they're going to tell you what should be

1035
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,440
feeding these things this time of year

1036
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,759
that blackberry every farm we go out on

1037
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,440
to consult they have blackberry that's

1038
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,200
the easiest ferment we could all be

1039
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,639
making right now those fast growing

1040
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,639
green shoots

1041
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,400
make fill up a 50 gallon barrel throw

1042
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,838
again throw a couple gallons of leaf

1043
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,838
mold in there that's all you need

1044
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,680
through these others like you can use

1045
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,680
your urine oh yes go ahead

1046
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:32,200
we'll talk about that in a bit

1047
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,200
what was that

1048
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,320
no anything that's like already um dead

1049
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,320
you would you can use that for compost

1050
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,320
or mulch it's really good for that but

1051
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,920
because you're wanting the life out of

1052
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,480
that anything that you know whatever

1053
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,639
that you are um putting in here you're

1054
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,719
taking the life out the mycelium you

1055
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,879
know is like kind of liquefying it for

1056
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:59,199
you and then you're gonna strain that a

1057
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,358
really good um

1058
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:05,118
220 micron um what else is some good mic

1059
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:06,639
some good microns i use some of my old

1060
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,119
hash bags

1061
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:12,159
or there's just a bunch of really good

1062
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,760
um filter bags i found on amazon even

1063
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,920
that kind of go over your whole five

1064
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,000
gallon bucket kind of do a little fun

1065
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,680
research on that

1066
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,159
and then that just makes it really easy

1067
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,759
for you to strain because you can strain

1068
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:25,519
it enough where it can go through your

1069
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,079
fertilizer injectors and all of your

1070
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,920
irrigation and this like you said after

1071
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,920
where we do it through the irrigation we

1072
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,440
do rinse it you know through which is

1073
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,800
straight water because this can get

1074
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,440
really stinky

1075
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,800
and we do add these two together a lot

1076
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,400
is the jms and the jlf the jlf is like

1077
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,039
what you would use instead of like your

1078
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,200
feeds you know when you're doing bloom

1079
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:48,719
veg all that kind of stuff instead of

1080
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,319
having to buy those at the grocery store

1081
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,399
you're making your own that's what this

1082
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,680
is replacements of this is what this is

1083
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,160
for

1084
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,159
and this is a really old technique like

1085
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,239
i've even found it in my herbalist books

1086
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,159
like really old texts where they're just

1087
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:05,358
like grab the plant material fill it

1088
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,960
with water put in some um like i think

1089
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,559
mushrooms and i was like i held in a

1090
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,838
couple books and i was like wow that's

1091
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,358
really cool and some of them didn't even

1092
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:12,480
stay put my ceiling was just like a

1093
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:15,358
bucket and

1094
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,039
plant material so this jadam liquid

1095
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:18,559
fertilizer this is just an ancient

1096
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,719
technique that we're you know we're

1097
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:23,440
taking from indigenous people and from

1098
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:24,639
our ancient our ancestors

1099
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,559
um

1100
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,799
oh okay so i was going into our urine we

1101
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:31,440
can also like pee in these buckets as

1102
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,000
well and then you can put leaf mold on

1103
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,960
it and after six months you can use this

1104
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,039
and that is just straight nitrogen

1105
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,320
that'll just give a good shot you're

1106
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:41,838
going to want to give other things too

1107
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,079
but that night that will be a straight

1108
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,279
nitrogen shot for those plants

1109
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,760
um

1110
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,240
we haven't done any humanure at lunch

1111
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,960
yet but they're half but people do

1112
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:55,679
but we have done horse manure uh chicken

1113
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,039
manure goats you know all of these

1114
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:01,519
others that i love rabbit i love rabbit

1115
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,119
manure that is one thing that we um our

1116
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:04,719
main animal that we're having on our

1117
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,200
farm because it's also high in

1118
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:09,358
phosphorus potassium the nitrogen it's

1119
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,439
it's a really good one you can use all

1120
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,279
the time and you can put it directly

1121
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,280
onto the soil you don't have to wait for

1122
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,359
it to compost

1123
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,519
so that one's a really good one

1124
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:22,159
but yeah this is our our some of our

1125
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,960
things that we do at the farm the jadam

1126
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,838
liquid fertilizer we have 50 gallon

1127
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,920
barrels like a ball by our gardens and

1128
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,318
then we have tons of different buckets

1129
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,760
because sometimes we'll like go on a

1130
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,480
little um

1131
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,640
mission to the ocean and go vet and find

1132
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,559
fish like at the old fish cleaning

1133
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,879
stations and they'll have like just a

1134
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,880
bunch of bones and just grossness and we

1135
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,200
get excited we'll go fill some five

1136
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,920
gallon buckets with that fill it up with

1137
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,078
water and put some leaf mold on it and

1138
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,400
then put it and some place that we don't

1139
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,400
have to walk by very often for three

1140
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,400
months and then it's ready that's like

1141
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,639
your fish emulsion

1142
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,720
and then we've also done kelp we've gone

1143
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:05,199
and harvested stuff at the ocean and

1144
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:07,439
done the same thing with and also oyster

1145
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:09,199
the mussel shells

1146
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,639
we've done oyster shell

1147
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,960
um

1148
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,960
yeah

1149
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,480
oh

1150
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,920
yeah so the dilution rates on this it

1151
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,358
kind of depends it's just about like you

1152
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,240
want to start

1153
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:26,318
at about a 20 to one depends on how long

1154
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:28,479
it's gone for so the least amount of

1155
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:30,239
time is usually about 10 days and then

1156
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,719
you kind of check it and see if it looks

1157
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,719
like it's it's kind of done its thing

1158
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,719
but usually about 10 days

1159
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,358
is you can start to use it but the

1160
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:43,199
longer it goes the stronger it gets so

1161
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:45,119
at 10 at 10 days do it out at 20 to 1

1162
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:46,960
and then like i said as it gets stronger

1163
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,039
i usually do everything at about a 30 to

1164
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,440
one but they've usually been gone going

1165
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,960
for at least a month

1166
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,159
or more

1167
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,159
and

1168
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,679
so if you look at your your sheet you

1169
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:59,358
can kind of see we have some different

1170
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,318
things like urine you want it to go for

1171
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:05,039
six months for at a 50 to one your fish

1172
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:07,599
wastes at a hundred to one

1173
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,599
you can use quartz horsetail is a twenty

1174
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,920
to one most of your plants start out at

1175
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,880
a twenty to one

1176
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,880
and um

1177
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:21,439
the manure the chicken manure is also

1178
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,200
another one that

1179
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,720
i have done it like we have it right

1180
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,519
here where you want it to go for a month

1181
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,759
but i have done it and like 10 days it's

1182
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:33,039
just not as strong

1183
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,280
but i've had to use it and it works okay

1184
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,960
but the month it makes it really strong

1185
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,240
if you can let it go for that long and

1186
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,240
that's at a hundred to one

1187
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,119
and then after the buckets or the

1188
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,519
50-gallon barrels are emptied after

1189
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,680
we're done with that we don't clean it

1190
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:53,679
out or empty them you just leave that

1191
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:55,440
old plant material in there and let it

1192
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:58,159
just keep breaking down and then you're

1193
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,679
just gonna pile on more material and

1194
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,920
then fill it up with water again and

1195
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:04,000
leaf mold and you can continuously keep

1196
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,159
doing that because eventually that old

1197
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,960
stuff completely liquefies and then it

1198
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:09,519
just

1199
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,838
keeps happening so we never clean like

1200
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:14,719
these buckets out when they've like been

1201
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:16,559
designated as our jlfs

1202
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:17,679
and we don't have to

1203
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,400
um

1204
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:23,440
yeah okay is there any questions on this

1205
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,760
any more questions yes

1206
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,159
warhound

1207
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,480
i haven't used horror hounds for the

1208
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:33,279
jlfs just only because i haven't found

1209
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,400
that as much of it and when i find it i

1210
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,079
usually use it for my smoking blends i

1211
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,079
love whorehound it's a really good

1212
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,079
expectorant

1213
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:47,440
oh that's awesome good to know

1214
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,920
i'm thinking horror

1215
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,760
yeah in horror hound it's like a it's in

1216
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,440
the mint family and it's more of a it's

1217
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,000
a smellier herb

1218
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,838
and so it would be good as a jadom

1219
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,679
herbal solution it could be good as a

1220
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:01,679
pesticide because we're going to

1221
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,358
concentrate that and then it would go

1222
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,358
into the plants and i think that would

1223
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:08,159
be a really good jhs that's what i would

1224
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,440
use that one for

1225
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:11,199
yeah

1226
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,039
um there's a lot of different plants you

1227
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:16,239
just look around your grasses your

1228
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:18,400
miners lettuce your cleavers um like i

1229
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:20,000
said the net any of these spring grasses

1230
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,039
that just came out we're now kind of in

1231
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,800
the late spring so now i like to look

1232
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,719
around for like the flowers and the

1233
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,039
flower and the other spring flowers that

1234
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,799
are blooming and summer flowers and i'm

1235
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,400
starting to start making the bloom and

1236
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,880
fruiting ones

1237
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,480
and then transitions will come soon too

1238
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,240
as the fruits on the trees are just

1239
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,480
starting to come out

1240
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:42,879
and so we'll start on those after we

1241
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,880
start pruning the trees a little bit

1242
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,599
and so what's really nice about this is

1243
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,599
it's like you follow the growing season

1244
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,519
like it's very organic it's not like

1245
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,599
okay this is what we're doing today and

1246
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,920
we've got to get it all done you can't

1247
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,519
you have to really follow nature oh it's

1248
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,639
springtime now it's time to get the

1249
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:02,480
grasses for veg okay oh now we're going

1250
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:04,318
in transition oh now we're going into

1251
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,519
fruiting and so you just kind of follow

1252
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,400
with nature

1253
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:11,039
and it's just a very organic system of

1254
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,639
working with it so

1255
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,639
okay

1256
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:15,639
yes

1257
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:25,039
yes

1258
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:27,838
actually yeah we've known some people a

1259
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:31,358
a friend of mine did a rat

1260
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:34,480
i was like okay yeah yeah just same

1261
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:37,119
thing but i would put a lot of leaf mold

1262
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,039
in um but in water and put it somewhere

1263
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,079
you didn't have to smell but yeah you

1264
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:44,279
definitely can

1265
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:44,279
[Music]

1266
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,279
all right shaw yes what was so beautiful

1267
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,440
about these two things we love showing

1268
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,119
them because they're so easy like i

1269
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,000
literally just went out and harvested

1270
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,760
the grasses the horsetail and you just

1271
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,519
the water and you can see the leaf mold

1272
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,839
the leaf mold here is incredible

1273
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,599
and some of your drier regions of course

1274
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,358
where we don't have as many oak trees

1275
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,039
out where we are and it's like you said

1276
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:10,880
we kind of have to go up on the upper

1277
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,039
side behind the trees we kind of have to

1278
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,119
get down far in there

1279
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:17,119
but i've also seen two in really dry

1280
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,599
places you don't always see the white

1281
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,519
striations but you know that they are

1282
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,519
actually there because like you kind of

1283
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:24,639
just as long as you get past the top

1284
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:26,800
leaf level

1285
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:28,639
layer then you will find some even if

1286
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,680
it's just a little white on par of the

1287
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:34,719
leaf then it's there

1288
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,719
so yeah

1289
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:39,199
all right love that's great any more

1290
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,119
questions

1291
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:44,759
yes

1292
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,760
yeah definitely

1293
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,400
i usually i'll just fill a bucket up

1294
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:04,799
with the um unripe fruit the same thing

1295
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,079
within the water and the leaf mold

1296
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,079
mm-hmm

1297
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,079
yep

1298
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:15,358
yeah um i will do separate sometimes

1299
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,759
depending on what the nutritional needs

1300
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,519
of the plants are and also if we got to

1301
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,960
go to the ocean and harvest something or

1302
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:24,400
if we found something but i also create

1303
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,318
we also create

1304
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,639
like multiple plant ones like i have um

1305
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:33,599
barrels set aside that are veg

1306
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:35,920
transition and flowering

1307
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,440
and those are 50 gallons i have 250

1308
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,000
gallons of each

1309
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,519
um actually more at this time but then

1310
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,079
um

1311
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,239
those are all multi and so like the veg

1312
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,480
i'll go and take from we went and did

1313
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:50,558
mala we had a bunch of mala we harvested

1314
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,440
a bunch of nettle and then a bunch of

1315
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,920
just spring grasses we had alfalfa from

1316
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,440
the straw we had late or hey we had laid

1317
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,358
down before

1318
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,800
and so we were able to harvest all that

1319
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:02,558
and put it together i think some milk

1320
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,559
thistle was in there

1321
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,440
and so it's kind of like whatever you

1322
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,359
got

1323
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,200
and that's what i do for our veg and

1324
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:12,400
then i'll do um

1325
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:13,919
certain ones like i said just little

1326
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,079
specific ones

1327
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,480
depending on what i'm able to harvest

1328
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,800
and the same thing for

1329
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,000
transition and fruiting different kinds

1330
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,680
of fruits and flowers all together

1331
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,838
um

1332
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:30,639
yeah yeah just a mixture and i like to

1333
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:33,279
do that for like their main feeds

1334
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,400
and then add in a little mistletoe for

1335
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,880
some phosphorus

1336
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,358

get to be like the cook in the kitchen

1341
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,199

1342
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,119
50 gallon barrels that you mixed all

1343
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:52,639
those herbs and that's just fine i did

1344
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,160
that actually when i first started and

1345
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:56,000

1346
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:58,000
