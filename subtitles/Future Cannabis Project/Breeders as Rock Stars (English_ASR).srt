1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:07,500
what I'm hoping is that there will be

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:10,559
more than one company that will give

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,919
breeders an opportunity to just breed

4
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:16,559
and then that will commercialize their

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,059
genetics and that these companies will

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,239
compete with each other for the rights

7
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:24,118
to those genetics and that the breeders

8
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:27,589
will have basically it'll be like the

9
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:32,149
music industry and that breeders can

10
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:35,700
basically bring their their genetics to

11
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:37,410
these companies and let them compete

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,370
with each other for rights to these

13
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:42,599
genetics that's I don't know how soon

14
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:44,968
that's going to happen but that's what I

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,679
would like to I would like to have plant

16
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,070
breeders really be like the rock stars

17
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:52,350
and be the brand that's what I'm hoping

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,128
will happen and I'm I'm gonna do my

19
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,850
little part to make that happen but

20
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:58,849
can't make it happen alone
