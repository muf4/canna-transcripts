it must have been around 99 and that all

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,519
developed then and then you've been

48
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,359
doing talking trees for how long right

49
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,399
well talking trees became a brand in

50
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,319
2013. okay yeah right on and of course

51
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,920

00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,359
running too so

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,359

cool it's cool watching it happen um

56
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,360
do you why do you farm cannabis like

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,159
what draws you to that energy

58
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,200
i mean in the beginning it was just

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,118
you know

60
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,840
the mystique of like growing your own

61
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,439
plant and

62
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,280
um it was just fascinating you know and

63
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,479
so i understand and i was around like

64
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,919
1998 when i got to grow or witness and

65
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,759
like was in the fold of friends that

66
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,719
were like starting to grow and

67
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,639
um

68
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,680
i was just fascinated by it and so i was

69
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,439
like

70
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,599

00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,400
way from the start

75
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,080
and it just inspired me to like continue

76
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,879
to try and just connect with the plant

77
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,800
and

78
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,359

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,560
you want to talk a little bit about

81
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,319
talking trees farms like what what your

82
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,318
farm's about what makes it unique you

83
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,000

84
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,359
mean um you know it's just been an

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,318
evolution always trying to make it

86
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
better

87
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,359
you know we're off grid you know so

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,719
there's you know just natural

89
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,720
natural challenges there yeah

90
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,120
big natural challenge with all those

91
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:08,878
trees coming down huh yeah i mean i have

92
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,400
like literally over 200 trees 200 trees

93
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:11,919
for the audience they don't know we had

94
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,959
a massive snowstorm at the end of

95
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:17,439
december that wiped out willow creek for

96
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,400
power for like almost two weeks in some

97
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:23,039
places and yeah it was and so 200 you

98
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,599
said 200 trees came down about 200 trees

99
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,919
across the road a crosstalk oh that's a

100
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:31,280
lot of fun getting so uh we've been just

101
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,759
cutting you know chainsaws non-stop all

102
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,439
day yeah that's crazy and uh

103
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,598
luckily he didn't get like too much

104
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,759
damage to like infrastructure that's

105
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:42,479
right um yeah just a lot of work another

106
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,158
challenge but i guess it never ends

107
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,679
but yeah like but with farm management

108
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,919
like do you do you do anything that's

109
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,439
like unique or you find like helps you

110
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,158
know with you know your flower

111
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,799
production that you think is unique

112
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,878
yeah i mean for me it's always just been

113
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,719
like keep it simple you know don't get

114
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,399
too complicated with things

115
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,000
we try to avoid liquids as much as

116
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
possible because i hate plastic bottles

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,639
piling up yeah and

118
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,319
i relate and i just believe in like

119
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,000
keeping simple

120
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,000
you know

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,598
like look at things like from an earthly

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,840
perspective if we didn't have all this

123
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,000
technology and whatnot and so like

124
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,199
nature always knows how to to reproduce

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,439
itself and

126
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,199
and do the best job so try to mimic that

127
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,639
as much as possible of course like we're

128
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,319
trying to get two and three harvest a

129
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,079
year so but like you know we the the the

130
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,399
ethos is to try and be as natural and

131
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,399
organic and sustainable as possible

132
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,918
and of course you know we have to do

133
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,399
what we have to do to produce you know

134
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,560
yeah good product multiple times a year

135
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,560
so yeah we're just trying you know how

136
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,759
many strains do you guys grow like or i

137
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,000
shouldn't say strain sorry we're not

138
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,040
saying strains anymore that's right

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,680
strange is out how many cultivars

140
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,000
flavors flavors varieties oh man so many

141
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,918
way too many wait you got a lot yeah

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,319
yeah hundreds do you feel like hundreds

143
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,918
oh okay so because i feel like that

144
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,439
maybe someone in your position having a

145
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,839
dispensary too you know it's like you

146
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,319
can create these small batches of

147
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,478
different unique flavors that people can

148
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,519
you know cycle through more rapidly i

149
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,038
don't know do you feel like that's

150
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,038
benefited you

151
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,038
yeah for sure um

152
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,879
you know i'll take like two steps back

153
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,719
on this answer because

154
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,360
in 20

155
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,280
or 1920 you know i grew a lot of strains

156
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,120
trying to do like three per greenhouse

157
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,279
we're trying to like come out as a brand

158
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,918

159
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,839
and um you know it worked it's good but

160
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,478

pain in the butt of of surviving in

164
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,559
california market i saw this bulk market

165
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,959
last year like thriving people like

166
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,240
doing great and selling bulk flour and i

167
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,638
was like i kind of missed that

168
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,120
opportunity so next year this last

169
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,199
season so 21. i was like all right we'll

170
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,879
grow less strains

171
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,960
more bulk of the strain so we can get

172
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,120
some cash flow package

173
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:04,318
and it totally backs higher i'm like i'm

174
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,720
not selling any bulk like store it well

175
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,000
we got to package it mark it and move it

176
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
because

177
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,600
that was you know i knew that was coming

178
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,600
but i didn't think it was gonna come and

179
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,280
crash so hard so fast yeah it was pretty

180
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,639
gnarly i didn't think it was just gonna

181
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,478
be over

182
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,720
night season i know right well speaking

183
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,399
of storing how in harvesting i think i

184
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,080
mean it's kind of half the battle in

185
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,239
some ways almost like do you have any

186
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,918
interesting you know things you do for

187
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,600
just like nice climate controlled

188
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,318
systems you know harvesting

189
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,160
methodologies yeah for sure i mean

190
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,680
always try to harvest either early in

191
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
the morning or late in the evening

192
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,240
everyone like harvest right in the

193
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,079
middle of the heat of the day yeah i

194
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,319
feel that um

195
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,279
i'm trying the biggest thing that i

196
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,879
think

197
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,519
is overlooked a lot of times but trying

198
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,439
to like address and control is

199
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,120
even while it's still growing and you're

200
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,918
doing that first run of depths and it's

201
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,319
like middle of july and super hot trying

202
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,598
to shade the greenhouses oh yeah early

203
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,439
while they're still in there to try and

204
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,439
cut those temps down and

205
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,279
preserve the terps so you know it's

206
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,519
extra work so the crew like is pulling

207
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,038
two tarps a day basically

208
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,799
but you know that's an effort just to

209
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,120
like control and

210
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,879
and that goes back to like when we were

211
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,199
trying to hide the hoops and had remade

212
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,319
over them it was like a real like paper

213
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,280
type thin substance um that

214
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,720
like

215
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,519
um

216
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,120
you know defer translucency

217
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,120
and so you would get more of an indoor

218
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,759
look on those depths because you're not

219
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
like just getting away

220
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,840
no that makes a lot of sense because

221
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,759
you're kind of out of tune with the

222
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,839
seasonal way the plant would grow anyway

223
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,199
because you're doing depth and so that

224
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:38,478
was one thing that we've added to try

225
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,400
and like kind of keep those first run

226
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,079
depths from not getting like that too

227
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,279
burnt that's true yeah the summer i

228
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,598
don't people probably don't know our

229
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,159
willow creek summers can get really hot

230
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,240
easily triple digits like consecutive

231
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,400
days so yeah yeah now it makes a lot of

232
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,160
sense and that like little diffusion of

233
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,758
heat probably helps

234
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,439
and just affects the terps yeah the

235
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,960
terps don't burn off as fast yeah they

236
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,038
don't fall right they don't volunteer

237
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,318
yeah that's interesting and then um you

238
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,560
know just trying to create a good

239
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,840
climate controlled um building which is

240
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,000
you know taking a lot of work especially

241
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,359
being off grid and you have to run a

242
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,199
generator and

243
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,560
i just saw that the board of supervisors

244
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,000
are trying to like

245
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,839
tighten that up even tighter so i was

246
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,839
like i texted my supervisor last night

247
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,239
i'm like come to the farm like you know

248
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,560
you're in support of full sun grown only

249
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,400
cannabis but we still need generators to

250
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,120
do that yeah we're out we're out there

251
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,120
like we need power to cure and dry the

252
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,800
canvas properly and in a lot of

253
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,038
instances we might need it to get the

254
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,158
nursery starts going and so

255
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:35,598
you know and it's just one of those

256
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,200
things that has to

257
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,800
yeah it's part of the process and if

258
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,479
you're doing it well it's there's no

259
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,439
it's no

260
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,120
um

261
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,279
it's no more detrimental than just using

262
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,120
pg e power what uh what elevation you

263
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:51,200
guys have uh top is 1600 okay and the

264
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,959
lower end is about 1200 foot elevation

265
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,399
so do you have do you have uh plants on

266
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,719
both tiers

267
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,720
you do do you find any i mean it's

268
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,560
maybe not a silly question but any

269
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,360
difference in micro climate within those

270
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,879
two

271
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,480
levels do you have any deal with

272
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,519
anything or do you feel like it's pretty

273
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,039
similar

274
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,879
a little bit of difference a little bit

275
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,919
of difference a little bit

276
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,519
not too much and because same slope

277
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,838
same style yeah

278
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,440
yeah they just don't get as much sun

279
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,800
there's actually so many different spots

280
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,320
because

281
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,319
there's two i have two properties there

282
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,680
but they're set up like legacy growth so

283
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,399
you never wanted everything in all in

284
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,199
one spot so there's like two miles back

285
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,480
to this patch one mile to this one and

286
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,720
so they're all kind of so they're all

287
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,600
their own somewhat little micro climates

288
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,278
within that 1200 to 1600 foot elevation

289
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,278
that's cool man yeah it's really

290
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,480
interesting um well i mean we can talk

291
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,639
about a lot of things but one of the

292
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,959
things that i was interested in is all

293
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,958
of these packaging well let's go let's

294
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,639
go with the packaging first yeah since

295
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,719
we're on that tip

296
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,720
these are really interesting you just

297
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,200
came out with these and they're 100

298
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,560
compostable packaging yeah yeah they're

299
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,000
not out yet but they're coming next

300
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,399
month so these are the tests these are

301
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,480
the basically that's a production

302
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,639
production run just waiting on the bulk

303
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,120
we had a few samples fedex just to make

304
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,439
sure they cool and what is the the ink

305
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,639
is like soy or something something like

306
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,560
that some

307
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,199
it's pretty water-based yeah water-based

308
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,919
right 100 compostable packaging so you

309
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,800
got these for your eights eights yep and

310
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:23,199
then you also have this

311
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,479
which is a pre-roll packaging that's

312
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,079
also 100 compostable yeah so this part

313
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,360
right here

314
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,519
is this

315
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,200
biodegradable packaging which is pretty

316
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,240
dope yeah i'm pretty stoked on that yeah

317
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,560
it's really cool

318
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,759
i don't see that too often at all in the

319
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:42,639
industry so kudos to you my man for

320
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:45,759
you know taking the time and money

321
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,278
and energy to work towards this we all

322
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,200
need this in the industry and i hope a

323
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,278
lot of people take your lead and follow

324
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,560
through with us so yeah the funny thing

325
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,240
about that is

326
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,159
to develop that what i did was i went to

327
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,799
the co-op and took one of their uh oh

328
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:01,919
yeah the bags their bags i was gonna cut

329
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,359
it up yes it sent pictures to my uh

330
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,439
packaging factory i was like well this

331
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,200
is what i want to do that's so funny

332
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,320
because when i in the back of my mind i

333
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,680
didn't want to say it because i didn't

334
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,278
want to feel like no one knew what i was

335
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,199
talking about but i was literally

336
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,759
thinking this feels just like the co-op

337
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,480
bag so that's really funny to me that

338
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:22,000
you said that yeah that's where i that's

339
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,759
kind of hilarious all right so

340
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,720
we're moving on to your flowers here

341
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,360
yeah

342
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,959
um this is the garlic cookies yeah so

343
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,079
the lao trees box means it's like an

344
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,518
indoor yeah

345
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,359
okay cool

346
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,278
very exciting

347
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,720
the garlic cookies uh the only other

348
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,480
person that had garlic cookies was

349
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,560
hannah

350
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,399
and i i know it's a really hard strain

351
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,639
to grow it's not necessarily hard but it

352
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,720
just takes a long time

353
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,879
so very few growers i know actually are

354
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,639
taking the time to uh it's one of those

355
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,320
strains that you could just it never

356
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,720
looks like it's finished it just want to

357
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,040
go and go oh it smells so good i love

358
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,959

363
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,800
actual uh packaging

364
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,120

371
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,240
talking trees is okay so the gmo is 30

372
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,278
thc

373

awesome that's that's really cool man

377
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,439
yes we we test or we test for terpenes

378
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,079
on all our smokeable products but we

379
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,240
list the top three on all the packaging

380
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,000
so wow you're really growing that's even

381
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,560
a greater feat growing

382
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,200
growing garlic cookies indoors

383
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,638
because of the time yeah but i guess it

384
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,800
stretches a lot so you don't have to veg

385
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,480
as long do you not veg it as long

386
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,399
um or do you

387
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,600
no i mean it doesn't stretch incredibly

388
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,958
that much

389
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,399
um

390
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,679
yeah we just actually pulled a room over

391
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,759
today it was is

392
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,000
looking amazing actually yeah that's

393
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,078
awesome okay so with that now we're

394
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,958
moving on to the lemon royale lemon

395
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:17,919
royal

396
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:20,239

397
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,319
that's like our our talking trees vino

398
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,959
that we hunted out of the swamp boys

399
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,720
seed oh nice yeah

400
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,159
where did you get this uh it was it just

401
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,278
like random seeds are you just like

402
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,879
picked up

403
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,559
we got them at uh probably the emerald

404
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,200
cup two three years ago three years ago

405
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,559
i'd say oh cool um that's the good thing

406
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,839
about being a vendor at the emerald cup

407
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,838
if you're there early enough where you

408
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,839
can like get to the seed lines you want

409
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,760
before the crowds get there i know what

410
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,199
you mean ryan had me do that this year

411
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,039
it's funny

412
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,120
during setup you just go make the rounds

413
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,719
and that was one we picked and uh

414
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,360
we picked a fino out of the seeds and

415
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,399
that one is amazing yeah it's like short

416
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,440
it's got

417
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,480
it's pretty

418
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,399
like

419
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,560
it's hard to describe exactly but it's

420
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,559
like

421
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,159
it almost has

422
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,518
i don't know what is that smell it's

423
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,039
very it's kind of like you can see how

424
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,120
it's smelling it's been sitting in

425
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:13,120
my car for a minute no it's got like a

426

428
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,480
hint of

429
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,359
i don't know can't quite put my finger

430
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240

yeah so yeah so you're not just doing

441
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,078
you're all you're all over the state

stores

444
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,360
awesome that's that's yeah that's

445
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,439
another aspect the distribution side of

446
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,278
it right a lot of work yeah i know right

447
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,880
yeah it's wild well i mean speaking of

448
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,879
like that distribution and like

449
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,639
technical side one of the questions

450
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,759
we've been asking all the farmers is

451
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,959
like

452
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,559
what do you think

453
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,479
if you had to change one thing in the

454
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,759
industry whether it's education or

455
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,839
regulation

456
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,519
relating to production or distribution

457
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,120
or whatever what do you think what would

458
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,399
be the more impactful thing that you

459
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,120
would change

460
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,879
state cultivation tax state cultivation

461
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,480
tax yeah

462
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,320
yeah the taxes have been pretty hot

463
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,800
today it's kind of rare i mean it's

464
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,240
ridiculous like you know and

465
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,240
even on a local level i see the stop

466
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,079
measure s and

467
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,159
i don't mind paying local taxes it's

468
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,159
good for our local community it's not

469
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:37,039
that bad yeah it's that state

470
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:39,120
cultivation tax per pound or per ounce

471
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,958
what they yeah it's

472
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,000
it's killing us it's insane and it's

473
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:46,638
done even before you sell the product

474
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,198
like it's it's tax once it's like

475
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,720
manufactured and yeah it's it's it's

476
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,639
attached it comes due yeah which is

477
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,399
crazy that's insane

478
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,320
it's absolutely insane it's fine it's

479
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,839
mind-blowing because even if you had a

480
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,839
great business or you have a great

481
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,360
business and you want to do things and

482
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,680
do education as part of marketing

483
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,120
whatever you just it's all going to the

484
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,319
government it's all right they take it

485
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,639
it's like everything yeah they're taking

486
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,720
ed they've just funneled off everything

487
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,720
like when the when the bulk price of

488
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,839
pounds are going for 400 and you're

489
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,920
giving 160 in tax right how do you grow

490
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,560
it and or get it manicured for less than

491
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,639
240 that's crazy that doesn't work it's

492
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,638
not feasible and it doesn't exist in any

493
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,879
other agricultural commodity

494
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,680
besides cannabis yeah which is just

495
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,278
ridiculous i know so yeah does

496
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,039
california i mean you probably know when

497
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,360
i would i haven't been up on the other

498
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,278
state's laws or regs but is california

499
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,879
kind of dropping the ball more than

500
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,720
other states like i heard colorado's

501
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,600
better like it's like taxed at the end

502
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,519
at the sale point of sales yeah

503
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,800
well there's two i mean

504
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,159
there's two ways to look at that i think

505
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:52,719
california is a great model for business

506
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,319
the worst model for taxes and i think

507
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,320
other states have maybe not the best

508
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,040
models for business they're catered to

509
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,079
like big mega corporations but the taxes

510
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,919
are way low

511
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,519
there's two ways to look at the

512
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,599
comparing it to different states so

513
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,359
we're the worst on taxes

514
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,078
i think we're probably one of the best

515
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,759
on entry and availability to people to

516
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,558
get into the market

517
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,759
but

518
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:17,918
it doesn't really help if you kill them

519
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,759
i know man it's crazy what do you think

520
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,038
i mean this is just me talking politics

521
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,359
but i mean like

522
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,838
really like truthfully like what does it

523
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,198
take for people for a community to

524
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,759
change this policy you know it's like

525
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,160
does it come to you and me running for

526
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,558
district supervisor or senate you know

527
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,720
like or is that even you know

528
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:39,038
i mean do you have to overthrow the

529
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,558
governor to do this like where did where

530
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,319
do you think it really lies like

531
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,119
collectively collective union like a

532
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,200
union like what do you think well you

533
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,439
know i sent an email to natalie hcga to

534
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,960
ask that question like can the governor

535
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,279
just like do a

536
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,600
you know executive action like right

537
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,119
like this has to change like asap like

538
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,599
fucking tomorrow

539
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,079
like i'm trying to survive here

540
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,879
and she said because of the way prop 64

541
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,558
was passed it's a legislation

542
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,240
i might not word it all right but it's a

543
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,319
legislative thing it has to go through

544
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,679
like assembly and voting and

545
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,439
nothing's going to happen for at least

546
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,960
six months the earliest that it could

547
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,720
change would be july of this year it

548
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,480
would have to be almost like a

549
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,679
collective of voters putting pressure on

550
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,240
individual legislators enough pressure

551
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,640
to where they feel like it's worth them

552
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,079
changing something like that and then i

553
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,600
think also building

554
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,279
communication with the people that are

555
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,199
getting that tax money because that's

556
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,960
another point that someone else made to

557
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,720
me is that like

558
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,558
there's a lot of money going to a lot of

559
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,640
different organizations because of those

560
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,759
state taxes and so they don't want to

561
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,679
lose that money that they're getting

562
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,839
true that's a lot of common there's a

563
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,440
lot of complex stuff it's like well you

564
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,000
want to get a lot now and nothing in

565
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,080
five years or let's balance this out

566
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,319
let's like make sense of it so there's

567
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,839
longevity or and sustainability in it

568
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,279
because it's not sustainable the way

569
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,000
it's set up right now and it won't last

570
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,519
and

571
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,519
everybody's going to lose including

572
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,960
those people that are getting the money

573
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,400
so it's like something has to change

574
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,038
something has to change

575
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,280
and quick you heard it here from craig

576
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,440

577
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,160
clothing company dispensary and farm

578
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,080
he's pretty well versed in business so

579
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,440
yeah i would take his advice so thank

580
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,519
