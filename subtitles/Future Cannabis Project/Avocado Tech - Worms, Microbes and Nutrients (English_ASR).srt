[Music]

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,609
my name is Arturo and tonight I'm here

3
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:30,329
with the man the myth the legend the

4
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:33,420
tech finally the creator of avocado -

5
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:36,780
yes sir yeah so please just tell us tell

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:41,219
us about it yes how it came to fruition

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,480
everything sure yeah just as a grower I

8
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,448
wanted to look for something that was a

9
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,609
little bit more easy I know myself as a

10
00:00:45,448 --> 00:00:49,469
grower and I know that I'm not you know

11
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:52,109
I like my time to be for observing

12
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,969
plants and not for doing busywork and

13
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:55,679
mixing things together and so on

14
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,808
I initially gravitated towards the

15
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,908
living source table just because you

16
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:02,189
know I can hook up automatic watering I

17
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:05,548
can keep a moister root zone and

18
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:07,170
basically you know cut a few corners by

19
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,430
having something good I don't need to do

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,340
you know

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,200
and so avocado came to me because I used

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,200
the system water and called blue mat and

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,299
blue mat is is a gravity-fed drip

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,650
irrigation that operates off a

25
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,509
tensiometer I'm sure a lot of people

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,189
know it but it was a portion of reading

27
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,509
about how to use their stuff where I

28
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:29,758
came across them talking about a

29
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,618
nutrient well okay and essentially you

30
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,349
have a dripper and then below that

31
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,909
dripper you'll make a nutrient well and

32
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:38,188
whatever your specific nutrient is for

33
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,409
the time and so I had seen a few

34
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:42,508
vermicompost videos before you keep

35
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,210
going yeah well so now you actually

36
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,429
creating a divot in your bed sure

37
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:49,949
dropping with dry minutes there yeah

38
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:51,868
that's the principle so over time there

39
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,450
was well you know sucked down to the

40
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:56,578
resolution and have an effect and so

41
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,429
basically I had seen a few people in

42
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:01,709
vermicompost and went worm bin posts

43
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:04,379
talking about avocados and just how they

44
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:07,379
were magic for the worms and so I

45
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:10,590
absolutely love ya and so we all loved

46
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,568
them and basically I just my brain

47
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,250
started cooking and I thought hmmm how

48
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:15,750
can i how can I use these things in my

49
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,818
setup I don't didn't really have space

50
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,979
for a worm bin at the time and I figured

51
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:23,099
that one way to do it was try to compost

52
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:24,389
directly in my containers and so where I

53
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:29,250
kind of diverged from the vermicompost

54
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:30,759
crew was I decided to make a chef

55
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,209
background so yes

56
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:36,310
I started making some flag guacamole for

57
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,408
him you know I've been mixing in some

58
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,090
dry amendments and then I started

59
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:44,078
researching you know what kind of

60
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,789
amendments I could get from nature and I

61
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:47,829
started looking into fruits and forgot

62
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:49,840
one so that very first pod that you ever

63
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:52,000
put down yeah yeah it was that mixture I

64
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,209
believe that was a veg pod because you

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,560
know I was I was I was had a nice group

66
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,150
you know grow getting ready everything

67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,250
was looking prime and I'm like man what

68
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,349
kind of what else can I do to kind of be

69
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,539
hands-off but set this thing you know

70
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:07,959
off I had probably fifth round living

71
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:09,310
soil so okay so you that bed was already

72
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,709
round that bed was rocking it was

73
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,150
definitely rocking and I my warm

74
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,259
population was a little lower than I

75
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,730
thought it should have been so that's

76
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:19,078
where I was researching the vermicompost

77
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:22,658
stuff and and so anyways I basically

78
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,370
took my cover crop and I pureed it and

79
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:26,500
then I added the avocado meat to that

80
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,750
and I believe I was looking for some

81
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,908
calcium good to kind of carry through

82
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,759
food veg into early flour and beyond and

83
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:36,789
so I used the dust of some gypsum in the

84
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,769
bottom of a bag real fine and so

85
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:40,780
basically going light wasn't trying to

86
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:42,400
do anything nothing too crazy but I just

87
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,318
want to see what happens okay so right

88
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,449
now we just have the avocado we have

89
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,878
your cover crop to have some gypsum oh

90
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:51,760
yes sir and then beyond that a little

91
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:54,250
bit of dry kelp luckily we live in Maine

92
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,739
and Maine is the craziest resource

93
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,359
around here is Cal and so we don't

94
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:59,829
overdo it we understand that you know

95
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:01,599
you have to respect the kelp but

96
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:03,310
basically it's a little bit of kelp and

97
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,518
a little bit of malted barley which is

98
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,530
all you know fantastic enzyme yes it

99
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,239
just helps everything break down and

100
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,219
then the last and final thing I decided

101
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,930
to put in and this was the first time

102
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,250
and I moved away from this in the future

103
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,220
and then went back to because I saw how

104
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,199
well it worked was simple Kashi and I

105
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,720
blended that right in and what that does

106
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,000
is that kicks off the micro the

107
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,740
microbiology breaking down yes what you

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,348
put in the avocado and then I just

109
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,050
observed and I just observed observe I

110
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:33,969
did nothing else at that point and just

111
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,740
had a beautiful veg what was your all

112
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,479
set up at that time so what I mean how

113
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,418
many positives you put in

114
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:42,610
I'm sure so basically I used one avocado

115
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:44,948
per plant and I still pretty much stick

116
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,629
to that that style um if you want to go

117
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:49,028
really light you could you could just

118
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:50,259
use a half an avocado I definitely

119
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:52,028
suggest people in their systems

120
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,939
experiment and let's see what works for

121
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:57,069
them but yeah and so just it went great

122
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:59,110
and in the set up I had sort of a four

123
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:01,389
by eight hedge and it just filled the

124
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,479
screen quickly did you have any control

125
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:07,870
to kind of go off of the growth once you

126
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:09,459
hit that bed with that or it was just

127
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,139
more explosive than anything in those

128
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:13,329
past so I didn't do all the plants in

129
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:15,848
the bed okay basically I just tried it

130
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:19,209
on certain ones and I just saw those

131
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:21,878
those plants kind of take over the bed

132
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:23,680
so if I use it on too I think I used it

133
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,599
on too and they were like the the

134
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,199
dominant plants we're gonna be within

135
00:05:25,598 --> 00:05:31,478
the hedge and I was in that and then

136
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,710
again brain keeps on cooking and I was

137
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:33,998
like okay

138
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:35,468
what are we gonna do coming in you know

139
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:37,509
cuz I was doing this by the run it was

140
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:40,240
like a real-time run and so I was like

141
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:42,129
okay let's let's think about let's think

142
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,509
about going into flower here but I was

143
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:44,710
you know in the early veg when I'm

144
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,899
thinking about this and so I'm like okay

145
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:50,978
I'm gonna drop something for in the

146
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:52,959
avocado right around like two weeks

147
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:54,878
before I flip Oh God because I want

148
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,800
whatever is you know being broken down

149
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,430
in the soil takes time in organics and

150
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,379
basically I dropped the pot early and I

151
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,999
got the most site bud sites and

152
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:05,949
branching I've ever seen and these are

153
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:07,569
the cultivars that I had grown pretty

154
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,579
there's no about you know how to grow

155
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:11,110
exactly and they just I mean again

156
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:15,158
there's definitely something to genetics

157
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,020
sort of you know naturalizing or

158
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:18,639
becoming more affiliate familiar with

159
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:20,560
the Gro style that you're applying to

160
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,978
them especially you know in a clone

161
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,329
clonal form and so the edge I just saw

162
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:27,158
beautiful branching to saw an

163
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:29,788
improvement and I was literally doing

164
00:06:27,158 --> 00:06:32,019
less so and I was literally spending

165
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:34,658
nothing if you you know a few dollars at

166
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:37,049
the grocery and everything came from

167
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:37,050
from

168
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,919
all right so we'll get back to that

169
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:41,839
again so let's just go through the

170
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:46,758
actual step now that you've played with

171
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:49,399
it for a while what is your from seed to

172
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,460
harvest how you put how are you using

173
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,769
your avocado right and so I mean part of

174
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:56,598
it becomes preparation you know it's a

175
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:58,038
chicken or eggs internet situation it's

176
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:59,839
part of it becomes prepping for the next

177
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,699
round and you can employ that but let's

178
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,560
just say you're more gamax you have to

179
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:05,329
be a little bit of ahead of time

180
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,490
everything the schedule falls ahead for

181
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:09,829
certain and so let's disco like it's

182
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,470
your first time flipping into this style

183
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:14,810
I would put something down early and veg

184
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,449
you want nice healthy starts of course

185
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,339
always but um you're doing that calcium

186
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:23,300
that nitrogen from your cover crops

187
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:24,709
those hormones from your kelp and the

188
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,750
enzymes from the partly just to get

189
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,218
everything pop it in your Picasa I mean

190
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,360
you can use other there's a beauty of

191
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:31,908
this whole thing is that you can use

192
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,680
whatever you have your disposal in your

193
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:37,579
gross style what works for you but

194
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,530
basically for this you put early in veg

195
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:42,079
because you know two weeks before you're

196
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:44,329
gonna flip you want the next pot going

197
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,068
through and what I've seen before in my

198
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:48,948
you know experience and others

199
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:51,860
experiences and five days the pot really

200
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:53,449
starts to get Rocking ten days you've

201
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,740
got some worms just invading and

202
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:56,509
attacking and what's happening there is

203
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,788
the you know fungi and bacteria are

204
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,348
taking over the avocado meat of the

205
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:02,449
guacamole whatever you want to call it

206
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:04,490
and the worms just come you know come

207
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:06,379
calling it's beautiful thing and you

208
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,810
know by day ten you've got a mass of

209
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:10,759
worms in there there you know combing I

210
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,560
know breathing you know what time it is

211
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,759
but yeah you have this this hub and

212
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,579
that's that's the whole thing

213
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,439
is it creates this initial hub this

214
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:21,528
little micro biome that they hang out in

215
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,509
and just go wild and that is all the

216
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:26,089
micro arthropods all the bacteria all

217
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:26,900
the fungi all the all the worms it's

218
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,908
just it's crazy

219
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:32,809
now when you say early veg is that going

220
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:34,490
down after you transplant is it after

221
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,978
it's been rocking for a little while or

222
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,418
the best time I mean it's up to you to

223
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,940
really time it but I like the time it

224
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:43,009
basically with as soon as I feel

225
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,990
transplant shock is over okay you know

226
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:46,860
it's a beautiful thing just put the seed

227
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,970
in in there as well and you

228
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,110
be able to apply the pot a little

229
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,990
earlier if it's just you know just

230
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,490
popping in pod number two comes two

231
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,740
weeks before a flip-top that's what I

232
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:59,039
like to do it um I feel like resume that

233
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,019
is fast for phosphorous you said and so

234
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,088
mainly phosphorus again you can put

235
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,919
those those those tertiary angry

236
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:06,240
ingredients in there as well just to

237
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,639
kind of get you to goodness keep

238
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,320
everybody happy um but basically yes so

239
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,569
one of my main amendments is I

240
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,579
researched okay what's what's a what's a

241
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,100
fruit or a seed that's high in

242
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:18,929
phosphorus pumpkin seed Yemen is crazy

243
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,940
and it's abundant it's crazy about it

244
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:25,649
you can grow yourself you can you know

245
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:27,149
you can buy it who has yes yeah and so

246
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:30,570
make sure you use organic pumpkins of

247
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,919
course but basically you know you can

248
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,079
buy them store-bought you can process

249
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,899
them yourselves you can puree them whole

250
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:38,849
seed you can you know with the whole or

251
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,528
you can you can buy them processed

252
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,120
already and so you make sort of like a

253
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:44,578
nut butter and then thin that out with

254
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,409
the avocado okay and then add all your

255
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:49,019
other side ingredients as well the I

256
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:51,328
would probably slack off on the kelp

257
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,730
because of just the extra hormones they

258
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:55,769
kind of prevent flowering sometimes but

259
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:59,610
in a specific dry amendments you will go

260
00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:03,089
with um I would go one knots further on

261
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,980
the biology I use a protocol dr. C's bio

262
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:07,470
fox this is what I personnel moves are

263
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,209
done dr. C's bio foss okay

264
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,300
it's I believe it's inoculated on

265
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:14,219
non-gmo soybean and it's beneficial

266
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:16,259
microbes probably analogous to like a

267
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,660
mammoth be looking like that you know

268
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:23,759
you use I have not used members in my

269
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:26,578
garden yet but yeah so in a knock you

270
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,379
know more more inoculation in that one

271
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:29,609
if you have an eye Amal definitely you

272
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:31,769
know keep pumping that up with an IO

273
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,778
I've even experiments or doing no

274
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:35,070
microwatts a fungi in there just to make

275
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:36,958
sure all the relationships are there

276
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,879
because the roots like to because of

277
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,708
that moisture they'll grow up out of the

278
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,870
soil literally into the pot that's why

279
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:45,119
it's a most layer that's what sorry yeah

280
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,578
I so now we need two weeks before the

281
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,828
flip we got pod number two now when this

282
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:52,739
pi3 calm down part three comes down

283
00:10:49,828 --> 00:10:54,689
around day 21 which a lot of people like

284
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,879
to do the Leafs straight you know that's

285
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,089
very popular is to strip a lot of your

286
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,769
canopy at that point

287
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,589
and it makes us to do things while

288
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:03,970
you're doing it exactly so I usually lay

289
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,470
it down then again there's a little bit

290
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,149
I would say recovery period after that

291
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,889
which is similar to the after the

292
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:11,409
transplant shock so you can wait a

293
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:13,749
little bit and that stretch and then yes

294
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:16,058
and so that's this this is not gonna be

295
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:18,040
used right then anyway you know what

296
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:20,669
we're looking for and that is potassium

297
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:22,929
and potassium helps with ripening and

298
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:24,429
the other thing that I wanted to target

299
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:26,349
on was like terpene production you know

300
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:29,438
that's when your Terps start to evolve

301
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,209
and change into a more mature state or

302
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:34,328
whatever you want to call it and

303
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:36,159
basically you can influence that by what

304
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:38,708
we with what you use and luckily there's

305
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,749
a lot of great fruit sources for

306
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:43,359
potassium so think banana

307
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:48,069
you know peel and all you know pureed in

308
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,509
or think mangos is wonderful and you can

309
00:11:48,068 --> 00:11:52,778
kind of the way I look at it is that

310
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:54,339
these all have precursors to terpenes in

311
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:56,438
there as they break down so when these

312
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,209
terpenes are brought down to ground you

313
00:11:56,438 --> 00:12:00,338
know your herb isn't sucking up mango

314
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:02,678
flavor from the mango but all the

315
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:05,019
precursor elements that created those

316
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:07,120
terpenes are there again broken down and

317
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:09,009
then your plant can express it

318
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,009
genetically whatever way it wants to so

319
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:14,470
you can grow some crazy mango herb with

320
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:17,379
mangoes for sure I mean that's that's

321
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,899
definitely a thing but yeah so basically

322
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:25,389
beautiful fruit purees I'm really a fan

323
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:27,039
of figs prunes are amazing and think you

324
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:28,600
know darker strains purple strange

325
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,759
things like that like I know it sounds

326
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,949
silly but they have all the pigment you

327
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:35,709
know base base layers of pigments and

328
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:38,740
terpenes and it just they they make your

329
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:43,739
plant like you know flex definitely so

330
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,970
okay so by day 21 week 3 a flower

331
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,629
avocado Tigers done it's done

332
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,939
that's it all right so I would imagine

333
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:54,399
just from was talking to me knowing you

334
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:58,019
you're you already amended your soil

335
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,970
ridiculously it's now in its fifth cycle

336
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:03,879
that's right we're all about lovin

337
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:06,160
loving cycle man so it's better than

338
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:07,970
besides the avocado check is there

339
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,269
anything else that you do i absolutely

340
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,069
so no so so basically I operate with the

341
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:14,568
law return I feel like if I take

342
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:16,250
anything out of my garden I need to

343
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:19,088
replace it some way yeah you know you

344
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,620
just yeah yeah absolutely and so

345
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:25,459
basically return all the cannabis leaf

346
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:27,889
all the cannabis stalks I will chop

347
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:29,929
varies depending upon its cover crops

348
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:31,278
just to make sure there's health in the

349
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:33,469
garden at all time five something that's

350
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,049
doing you know sickly I'll probably just

351
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,730
chop and put it to ground and it turns

352
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:40,729
over very quickly but that is the other

353
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,079
absolute you know key tenant and and the

354
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,120
other would be the bloom at watering

355
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:46,489
that's the way they all interplay is is

356
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,250
very special the blue mats have become a

357
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,528
very popular and I'm familiar with it

358
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,500
but please talk to us a little bit about

359
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:56,299
your system how it works with you run it

360
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,120
in the tech because it works together

361
00:13:56,299 --> 00:14:01,578
like you actually position your pods

362
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,709
right there complimentary to definitely

363
00:14:01,578 --> 00:14:06,078
um so I have two different you know I

364
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:08,929
have my own like personal retro where I

365
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,278
use just the dripper no blue soak or no

366
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:11,750
hose and everything like that and then I

367
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:15,019
have my green house which I use the the

368
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:17,149
soak so I have kind of you know witness

369
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:19,159
both of them in action I really do like

370
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:22,458
I love the soap but I really like the UM

371
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:25,429
the drip the drip emitter because you

372
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:27,679
position the avocado you know picture a

373
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:29,239
smooth shell and then you have the drip

374
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,370
you know dripping directly on that shell

375
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,558
and cascading down it just creates this

376
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,808
this umbrella of moisture under this it

377
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:38,899
works the same way with the hose - Trudy

378
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:41,149
and I will position my the pods like

379
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:42,620
along the hose and make sure you mulch

380
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:43,938
over them if you mulch over all this

381
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,409
anyway you're gonna get a good moisture

382
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:47,808
content if you're rocking blue mats but

383
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:49,568
um I just feel like that nutrient well

384
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:52,100
principle it's okay you know it's it's

385
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:53,899
it becomes kind of almost like an

386
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,509
incentive in sync with each other when

387
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:58,610
when the plant wants moisture you know

388
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:00,110
the blue mat gives it up and at that

389
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,879
point in time it's almost in a way

390
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,289
asking for food because you know you're

391
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:05,269
getting that trickle down beautiful worm

392
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:06,469
castings down in there that are nutrient

393
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:08,778
rich from everything that's broken down

394
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,610
so it's a lovely thing that's beautiful

395
00:15:08,778 --> 00:15:13,220
yeah so I mean to me it just sounds

396
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:16,159
intuitive it just works very well the

397
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:19,730
fatty miss acids inside

398
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:23,629
everything but to a person who's totally

399
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:26,269
new to it what well how would a Vacarro

400
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:31,009
work avocado tech work to the beginner

401
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:33,350
and why why should you know you can a

402
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:35,389
lot of people are in an innocent a space

403
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:38,420
where they're transitioning from salt

404
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:40,129
based bottle nutrients to organics which

405
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:42,860
is a great time to implement this but

406
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:45,589
I've seen it I've done experiments on

407
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,959
some of my starts which are not in any

408
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:50,959
kind of luxurious living soil some of

409
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:52,609
them and put put the avocado down and

410
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,278
the roots literally will grow up into

411
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,500
the avocado and you if you do have any

412
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,778
biology present springtails or you know

413
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:04,250
they will flock to that and so you do it

414
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:06,470
works even in a in a fairly like a in a

415
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,629
non fungal dominant soil it will still

416
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,339
have a benefit from my experience and

417
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:12,649
and the thing that stoked about it is

418
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:15,230
that it's above ground and so there's

419
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:18,068
very little possibility of root

420
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,720
pathogens and you know anaerobic

421
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:22,250
bacteria being a problem and again have

422
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,350
you fronted to any of those problems at

423
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,208
all I've had pods actually go anaerobic

424
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,310
for one reason or another but be

425
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:30,109
absolutely no problem it's just kind of

426
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:32,599
like they broke down in a different way

427
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,389
like think of Jude ombré says KNF like

428
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,189
one's smellier and I think that

429
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:38,810
depending on how you inoculate it and

430
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:40,278
what you put in I like to add a little

431
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:43,758
sugar to I didn't mention that in some

432
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:45,470
of them but um in the form of I'll use a

433
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,389
little I mean I'm from Maine we use

434
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,810
maple syrup so I put a little maple

435
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:53,329
syrup in there just to kick it off and

436
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:54,888
agave - it's cool um probably stay away

437
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:57,679
from honey you can use your brown sugar

438
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:59,509
if you wanted to but you know I like the

439
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:04,009
I like the idea of using something local

440
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:06,140
yeah now our our relationship

441
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:09,408
brotherhood started at the regenitive

442
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,929
college oh yes sir place changed my life

443
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:13,809
forever so I'm always thinking with

444
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:17,740
general it's just absolutely

445
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:22,509
and it's been a dream of mine to even in

446
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:25,120
this cold climate to somehow orchestrate

447
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:28,649
some hardiness avocados up here and this

448
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,908
was even before I even knew you but

449
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:33,278
staying along the sustainable

450
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:35,980
regenerative lines what would you say to

451
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:36,398
somebody who says you're trying to do

452
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,470
this

453
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:40,658
avocado tech in Maine right how

454
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:43,089
regenerative is and absolutely I've run

455
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:44,799
into it definitely in it and it was

456
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:48,788
really good for me actually because you

457
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:50,138
know I spoiled my herb and so I figured

458
00:17:48,788 --> 00:17:53,888
I'll make it up in other ways

459
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:55,898
you know I'll rock LEDs I'll you know

460
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:57,788
I'll change up what I'm doing to be

461
00:17:55,898 --> 00:18:00,609
sustainable as possible to kind of give

462
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:02,259
them this tree and then I started saying

463
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:05,288
not man I can do better than that and so

464
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:07,749
one of my first step was to hook up with

465
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:09,158
a local grocer who was an organic grocer

466
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:11,350
who was like yeah we're throwing these

467
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:13,259
always you know and then I got I'm like

468
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:15,939
yo when you're throwing those away

469
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:17,558
already and so what I started doing you

470
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,528
know was say these were gonna go in the

471
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:22,359
trash and and that's not without the

472
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:24,339
probable possibility for anybody hooking

473
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:27,490
up with her grocer like that in town I

474
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:29,798
mean it can work and another thing now

475
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,450
what I'm working on now as well is is

476
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:34,450
different options

477
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,340
pumpkins many worm from compost people

478
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,278
know pumpkins they go crazy for pumpkins

479
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:40,749
as well the worms that is and so that

480
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:42,220
could be absolutely be a dome so you got

481
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:44,470
it's the principle of it you've got this

482
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,929
humidity dome that is an attractive spot

483
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,980
for micro life to go crazy feed them

484
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:50,769
while they're there they're gonna stay

485
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,990
and hang out so basically you can divert

486
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:54,788
the avocado techs or whatever you put

487
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,638
your research into that that's good

488
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:59,319
enough to address their bed yeah and so

489
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:03,548
one of my other thoughts was Gork tech

490
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:06,099
you know gourds Norgrove of swords yes

491
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:09,940
and you can absolutely refill that show

492
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:12,128
over and over customs yes and once this

493
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,850
becomes a cycle you can prepare one year

494
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:18,009
in vegetable fruit nut crops put them

495
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:19,538
away for the next for the winter I've

496
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:21,220
been experimenting also with frozen

497
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:22,750
avocado you know that's another way to

498
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,639
stockpile them as they're coming from a

499
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,759
grocer if there's too many and you

500
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:28,429
really don't you

501
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:31,369
many miss a lot of dude with my boring

502
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,930
bitch first I want to do the puree I

503
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:34,969
heard that just freezing all the

504
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,799
material anyway is a good thing the

505
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,390
precursor for your where it can be

506
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,639
you're gonna get a quick breakdown on

507
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,710
the debate would be are you losing

508
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,270
something of the you know the fresh

509
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,950
quality versus the frozen quality

510
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:47,059
because you know the freezing is going

511
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,019
to break down a lot of bonds and

512
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:51,139
whatever your freezing

513
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:52,759
so I've seen good results from it though

514
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,800
I mean I would love this is what I want

515
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:56,720
to get this crowd sources because I want

516
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,149
people to go in on this and I want them

517
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,089
to report back and we need to set a

518
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,740
parameter of best practices and I mean

519
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:06,019
I've been doing it I think I have a good

520
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,390
idea with what it is but but I'd like to

521
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:10,970
see it on scale and I actually am

522
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:13,850
working with some homies out in Colorado

523
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:17,089
a little bit we're implementing it and

524
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:19,969
also Oklahoma excuse me who are using it

525
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:23,209
at scale and people have dropped me

526
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,100
lines from Chile and South Africa and

527
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,500
you're not we Cali in there they're all

528
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:29,599
they're experimenting with this you can

529
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,579
find some of the waste bars to add into

530
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:34,129
it just makes it brighter absolutely um

531
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:35,720
use what's local to you I mean you went

532
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:40,610
over pretty well but are there any other

533
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:42,140
tips that you would uh wow I mean I just

534
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:44,389
feel like it's good to highlight the

535
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,490
fact that um you know not only is this a

536
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,410
direct feed method but this can be just

537
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,660
our soil conditioning method in general

538
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,430
I mean you can implement this fully like

539
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,759
I do and it's that's my only way I feed

540
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:57,920
my plants period um which I haven't seen

541
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,839
in previously that's why you know it's

542
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,259
it's it's something that's in the works

543
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,399
but um I think that there's just a

544
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:07,400
million ways you can go

545
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,750
so do okay also so traditionally people

546
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,690
who do no till

547
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:14,059
living soil beds they'll either riah

548
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,279
mend their beds after one cycle two

549
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:18,409
cycles surely you're still real man I

550
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,450
haven't I was in the past before I fully

551
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,670
implemented avocado tech I would get

552
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,230
sort of like a mineral pack or rock dust

553
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,630
sand and put them back through but now I

554
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:29,059
add those through the avocado tech

555
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,890
because I literally have African

556
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:31,559
nightcrawlers and I have red wiggler

557
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,080
worms and they

558
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,849
for like you know layers of the

559
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,319
substrate exactly and they're the ones

560
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:39,990
handing it down to the next and they're

561
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,669
dispersing in so I feel like you know I

562
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,240
can accomplish everything you do in

563
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,519
topdressing

564
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,009
with the avocado tag and as long as you

565
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:48,440
stay consistent on it I've been seeing

566
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:52,559
just a beautiful

567
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,269
you know trajectory so now this goes a

568
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,389
little bit off of just the avocado

569
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:59,519
attack now you said yeah I love it and

570
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,590
that's how I kind of want to look at all

571
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,900
beds it's like it just it's like a fine

572
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:07,500
wine it just gets better over time but

573
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:09,740
I've also heard the thing where the

574
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,000
living soil beds hit a plateau

575
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,500
especially after like mother's like

576
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,200
seven or eight cycles something like

577
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,450
right right do you have any um insight

578
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,430
into that I would say that I I mean I

579
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,549
experienced a little bit of that but I

580
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:25,410
think I think people are quick to judge

581
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:27,059
that something is going downhill and I

582
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,890
think you need a soil test and I think

583
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:32,369
that would be the that will that will

584
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:34,200
cut that fear out and again as more

585
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:35,909
people use this style people are gonna

586
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,039
say wow you better check in on the fifth

587
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,759
round see how it's doing you know or

588
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,039
whatever it might be

589
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:42,480
I'm just saying so I think there's

590
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,119
different protocols just not in the game

591
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,000
right now and people you know are

592
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:51,239
learning you know they're doing and I

593
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,710
feel like yeah it can hit a plateau but

594
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,650
then I think there's ways to pull it out

595
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,420
and correct it and I think that that can

596
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:59,280
be worth it rather than some people just

597
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,050
dump it and let's go for some new things

598
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,299
but I think there's a finesse to the

599
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:05,159
older soil that you can't get in the

600
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:07,079
younger punky soil think your minerals

601
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,090
haven't really fully broken down in some

602
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,519
of your long-term amendments excuse me

603
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:13,230
I'll use moister sell and things like

604
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,240
that that it takes a long time and

605
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,309
there's you know lovely calcium but

606
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,240
there's other principles or your chitin

607
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:25,470
source you know your crab meal or your I

608
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:27,480
used the squid squid quills the bony

609
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,519
part of the inside yeah you know what

610
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,170
squid fishing one day and we got a lot

611
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:32,819
of them and I dried them out because

612
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:35,070
they were just beautiful and then I read

613
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:36,179
an article on chitin and they got period

614
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:38,700
and put it in the bed

615
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,830
and yeah so cool shit like that but now

616
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,809
I like to spoil the herb but I also like

617
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:45,659
to think about it in in in the terms of

618
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:47,129
scale you know and as great same way so

619
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:52,410
I was just thinking my son yes I said

620
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:54,540
earlier so right now what what are the

621
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:56,279
environments that you've been testing

622
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:59,399
your situation I like what you have

623
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:01,529
parameters my friend wants you once you

624
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,290
lay that out how would I look how to

625
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:06,480
technically scale how would it go well

626
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:10,409
so I rock the VPD

627
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,740
you know humid warm we're talking to 84

628
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,810
degrees probably 70 and 70 plus and

629
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,640
that's good pens on you genetics that

630
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:19,289
you're running so sure I think they all

631
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,870
like it a little I like to run it hot

632
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:25,170
because I liked mice mice mainly for my

633
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:27,899
soil I mean the plants can adapt the

634
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,029
soil is I find that it kind of works at

635
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,430
that higher temperature um in a better

636
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:34,980
way the synergy you know I rock LED

637
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:36,450
lights um so I don't have a lot of heat

638
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,950
generated through that so I need other

639
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,640
climate you know control to make sure

640
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,850
Mike heat is on point check your

641
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,580
temperature

642
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:46,859
I do not only because I'm pretty

643
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:48,419
confident through my infrared scope and

644
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:55,079
insects that I know the range that is

645
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:57,450
probably yeah it's one of those things

646
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:59,220
like a lot of is intuition but I'm back

647
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,230
and making sure it's all checked in with

648
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,870
science okay you know I'm saying so it

649
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,730
just feels right to do it this way and

650
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:08,219
I'm just making sure that on the back

651
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,599
end of the science is straight and you

652
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,370
know what another thing I'd like to do

653
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,919
is get some more microscopes on the

654
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:16,469
activity of the avocado tech and again

655
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,029
these it's in development and we need to

656
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:24,210
get a get a handle on what's going on

657
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:25,740
but yeah it's so okay to get back to the

658
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:29,509
second part of the question on the

659
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:32,309
scaling up side of things the shell is a

660
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:34,859
huge part of the dome it's always part

661
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:37,649
of it you know would it just be more

662
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:40,979
man-hours trying to do those handcrafted

663
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:44,340
pods right yeah essentially I mean what

664
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:46,559
you can do is make a large batch and

665
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:48,509
again when you look at all the time

666
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,839
you're taking and manicuring and other

667
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:50,308
men

668
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,158
things you'll have to do this three

669
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:55,798
times in the whole cycle so yeah it's a

670
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,870
little bit of hand work but um you know

671
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:00,119
and the other thing that's worth talking

672
00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:02,009
about is is it's avocado techie in the

673
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:02,969
dorm you could do that in our industry

674
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:05,038
we can afford

675
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,169
Wow yeah I mean because they've comes

676
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,769
back well the least touches on anything

677
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:12,778
you know as possible definitely the you

678
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:14,400
know the lean kind of workload is great

679
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:16,048
and that's the believe me that's why I

680
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,269
developed this so anything that you can

681
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:20,369
do that will you know give you time to

682
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:22,470
observe the plants you know definitely

683
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:24,599
do it but three times is a beautiful

684
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,909
thing and I think that it could work on

685
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:29,849
a larger scale and I think you can make

686
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:31,440
large batches and I think that it could

687
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:33,089
work extremely well and you can end up

688
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,070
with some really unique cannabis because

689
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:37,199
on a larger scale you're gonna you're

690
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:38,490
gonna get a nice source of each one of

691
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,759
your ingredients and that's gonna give

692
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:46,319
your end product of individuality I

693
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,940
always ask is there something that you

694
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,939
prepared to talk about that I didn't ask

695
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:58,370
you about no I don't think so

696
00:26:50,940 --> 00:27:01,169
I mean oh I'm just trying to think maybe

697
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:04,619
we've stopped about mats we've talked

698
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:09,390
about indoor versus outdoor no no no

699
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:12,178
tech okay okay so um indoors you have a

700
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,850
lot more control of course and so things

701
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:16,288
that some things are probably possible

702
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:21,058
inside that may not be as effective

703
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:23,579
outside using a lot of sugars using you

704
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:25,259
know making it extremely you know sweet

705
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:26,879
avocado pod that you're putting down is

706
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:28,500
probably not a good idea outside you're

707
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,778
gonna track and I think that you might

708
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,480
not want to so but again your your

709
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:36,538
multi-layer is your friend um you want

710
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,980
tuck the avocado down below it and you

711
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:42,058
definitely want to charge these avocados

712
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,829
to outpace pests you want you know

713
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,240
inoculate them with your fungi with your

714
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:47,278
IMO and these things will disappear

715
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,509
incredibly fast if you've got enough

716
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,599
worms in your bed they will disappear

717
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:52,740
incredibly fast and so you just have to

718
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:54,538
think about that the other thing we

719
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,700
talked about is for outdoor cultivation

720
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:59,369
maybe making it a little IMO style cage

721
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,460
to put over your your section now again

722
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:04,849
on large scale this may be

723
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,778
not extremely feasible but if you again

724
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,119
if you charge it and use your

725
00:28:05,778 --> 00:28:10,429
multi-layer I think you definitely get

726
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:14,629
that that pod calm before there's an

727
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:16,278
issue and and keep it moving and let's

728
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:20,419
just get it out there everybody needs to

729
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:24,169
give it a try absolutely said put your

730
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:24,649
own little twist to it yeah just keep it

731
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,990
natural

732
00:28:24,648 --> 00:28:28,158
absolutely so I guess I will highlight

733
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,200
the things you're gonna want to include

734
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,210
in that and that's pretty tech you're

735
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,080
gonna want min a mineral component it's

736
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:37,100
great you know you want a

737
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:39,558
microbiological component it's great

738
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:40,939
fungi of some sort bacteria of some sort

739
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:43,369
and that can be anything

740
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:46,429
recharge mammoth I mean you name it but

741
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:48,288
I highly suggest I most because

742
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:49,490
indigenous microorganisms are gonna you

743
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:52,038
know they're just gonna operate better

744
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:53,690
in your system and and you can get them

745
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:57,319
gone and then again the sugar source to

746
00:28:53,690 --> 00:29:00,350
keep it poppin and whatever your target

747
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:02,808
nutrient is for that particular you know

748
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:05,750
stage I have the plants like how do you

749
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:08,599
like do you like the full vixen humic

750
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:10,788
acids I mean they're they're great again

751
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:13,009
i don't add a lot extra what I do is

752
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:16,490
which I should explain it just build a

753
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:19,730
great living sort of a start you know

754
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:24,679
mint mineral rich just just you know

755
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:26,480
with plenty of aeration and just let it

756
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,130
break down over time you know I when I

757
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,808
concocted it I was thinking how's this

758
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,700
gonna how's this gonna be holding up in

759
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:34,428
five years ten years whatever it might

760
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,740
be and I built it for time you know you

761
00:29:34,429 --> 00:29:39,200
hear a lot of people late in morrison's

762
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,700
one talking about the horizons within

763
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,409
the soil and I wish I had known that

764
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,899
when I built my bed but I think I kind

765
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:48,620
of in to do Italy did you know I put a

766
00:29:44,898 --> 00:29:50,418
lot of pumice shale down on the bottom I

767
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:51,558
didn't really do a silt layer but I

768
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:54,230
think some of the stuff that I'm using

769
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:55,970
is kind of made that happen okay

770
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:58,610
gypsum oh yeah you know rock dust

771
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:59,929
something like that so all I can say is

772
00:29:58,609 --> 00:30:02,959
everything's rockin really really well

773
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:05,149
and I will hopefully in Maine you know

774
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,329
we'll get access good access to some

775
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:09,369
soil testing that's that's easy

776
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:10,779
we're kind of far removed and so we

777
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:13,269
don't have the infrastructure in the

778
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:18,450
industry here newly being RAC and you

779
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:18,450
know getting out of prohibition

780
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:28,899
what is the avocado tech feeling right

781
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:30,640
now strain why yeah um one in my last

782
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,910
run was interesting because I wanted to

783
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,740
do a cultivar that was was hot everybody

784
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:40,750
knew and I wanted to see how it would

785
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:42,789
react and so I got a hold the Mac and

786
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:46,210
the shock of the homie hash on that one

787
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:48,430
and basically I tried that out and it

788
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,720
came out lovely I mean beautiful I

789
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,660
actually grew up the greenhouse and I

790
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,150
grew it inside and just the tert

791
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,350
profiling was was was very loud which

792
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:59,110
I'd heard that it was a little bit muted

793
00:30:56,349 --> 00:31:01,269
but not in this case it had it had more

794
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:04,299
at least with the fuel and some I got a

795
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:05,950
purple female and I got a beautiful one

796
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:09,549
that rose doubt in the end that was in

797
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:12,190
the greenhouses of Mac - Mac 3 in the

798
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:13,839
greenhouse yeah so it's that that we can

799
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,100
maybe show Instagram photo of that but

800
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,709
yeah that was that was lovely

801
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:21,099
and so now I'm still working with my

802
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:23,710
baby is called as a mystery cut we call

803
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:25,659
the SPR not to be confused with sugar

804
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,640
black rose there was some confusion that

805
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,400
it was that one point but I can tell

806
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,500
that it's not and so working with her

807
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,210
and then shout out to my man we've in

808
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:39,339
genetics we collabed on some beautiful

809
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:41,079
crosses of the SPR because I really

810
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:42,639
wanted to get it into seed form because

811
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,019
I just loved it as a cut not wait so

812
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,720
what does it lose what is what's the

813
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:49,599
acronym for them we it doesn't have an

814
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,839
acronym it's just remains SBR for now

815
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:56,230
yeah and so high turpentine profile high

816
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:59,740
Mercian profile my background is in

817
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:01,839
beverage my family business and I've

818
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,000
been trained in wine since I was 21 and

819
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,980
so I gravitated towards the string

820
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,509
because it checked all the boxes it was

821
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:12,789
for the floral had it citrus it had fuel

822
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:14,140
and it was just it was unique you know

823
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:14,819
it was something I didn't smell every

824
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,380
day

825
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:17,879
I do a lot of wine tasting and sampling

826
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,890
and I'm not constantly getting bombarded

827
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,860
with different aromas in this didn't you

828
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:25,320
have it before the avocado I did I had

829
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:28,469
it before the other night and just it's

830
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:31,109
just it's it's yeah it is it's it's

831
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:33,420
transcendent what it used to be you know

832
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:36,329
I can see additional Frost the dish just

833
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:39,509
really pungent terpenes I think it

834
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:41,939
tested in arrows it was a crazy high but

835
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:44,039
it was 23 or something like that for for

836
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,259
its overall cannabinoids it wasn't nuts

837
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:48,000
but question for you so now okay so

838
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:50,089
that's definitely one you have six

839
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,289
cycles in the house and it could have in

840
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:56,549
variety is the spice of life I know

841
00:32:52,289 --> 00:33:01,200
you've done hundreds yeah hundreds yeah

842
00:32:56,549 --> 00:33:05,250
do you notice any certain traits that go

843
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:09,809
throughout the different cultivars or do

844
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:12,299
you it's just overall better growth yeah

845
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:14,429
I mean I would just say that it tends to

846
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:17,369
amplify whatever the expression is so

847
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:18,690
it's able to express really loud on the

848
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:20,909
terpene profile I mean some of that is

849
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:23,670
you know drying and harvesting

850
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:25,110
techniques and etc but I'm just trying

851
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:29,460
to preserve the Terps keep everything

852
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:31,769
cool and dry slow and not get any kind

853
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,690
of danger zone and just you know but

854
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:35,970
beyond that I just feel that expresses

855
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,700
much much more frosty and much more lab

856
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:41,819
and just more vigorous growth in general

857
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:44,850
it's just an apparently I don't even I

858
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:46,649
mean your feet in the soil so it doesn't

859
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:48,509
really matter you said this Jenna

860
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,910
enhance whatever genetically is are

861
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:52,349
shortened I mean you know when different

862
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,240
people taste it I'm sure they can taste

863
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:56,459
the terroir I'm more familiar with it

864
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,380
you know cuz it's in my environment I'm

865
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,819
all around it's like barbecuing and then

866
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,780
trying to eat a rib and it just doesn't

867
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:04,889
taste like smoke you know so this is a

868
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:06,899
scenario where I'd love to get it out to

869
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:09,539
other people to sample it and I've got a

870
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:12,418
lot of people saying whoa yeah whoa loud

871
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:14,579
super loud so um it's interesting

872
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:15,989
because it's not your classic fuel or

873
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:18,569
anything like that it's a very for the

874
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:21,299
SPR it's very complex smell I would say

875
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:23,550
and yeah we're working on some crosses

876
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,589
and seeing what we have there

877
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,750
running the circus freak right now which

878
00:34:25,588 --> 00:34:32,159
is kind of a cool strain I believe it's

879
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:34,769
bred by grumbles beans shout out to him

880
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,710
and basically it's an interesting cross

881
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:41,280
because it's two CBD dominant varietals

882
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:45,000
crossed and they made a high THC progeny

883
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,519
so you basically are rockin with I

884
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,260
believe penny wise and Harlan Linton and

885
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,659
then on the other side it flipped and

886
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:55,710
it's a it's incredibly frosty sort of a

887
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:57,599
lighter colored cultivar and I can't

888
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,449
wait to get it tested see what see what

889
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,849
it's a yeah circus freak so those two

890
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:03,929
I'm working on the SBR cross with sour

891
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:07,880
bubble

892
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:11,519
I think that's bog seeds and dance world

893
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,769
which is a one day that lager mosa cross

894
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,559
with I forget the other one right now

895
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:18,329
sorry about that but um yeah it's uh

896
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:19,679
it's it's a really beautiful planet's

897
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:21,869
maintain some of the attributes from

898
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,549
what I've run thus far of the SBR the

899
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,900
frost the bud structure but it's a

900
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,760
little deeper color a little you know

901
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,200
we're gonna see what we have there if

902
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,720
they have some some pretty special stuff

903
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:32,489
hidden in the cup and then the other one

904
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:36,838
that I run is called Emerald X and that

905
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:39,899
was a Emerald Jack Fino that was again

906
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:41,699
sort of a mystery cross but I know one

907
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,450
part of the winning edge is Emerald Jack

908
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:48,449
and we we pulled a super-loud SuperDuper

909
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:48,868
the loudest Arab I've ever smelled out

910
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:50,669
of it

911
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:52,320
and unfortunately I let that go by the

912
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,000
wayside so I'm in the process now have a

913
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,280
bag of the scene I'm trying to get it

914
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,108
back but we have some beautiful like a

915
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,210
little little heavy lavender

916
00:35:58,108 --> 00:36:02,579
fino Zout of that well almost like

917
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,740
silver purpley looking I'm kind of like

918
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:10,619
the Mac but definitely presents more og

919
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:12,329
classical G looks and yeah and I have

920
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,130
pulled one I call it the stink it's not

921
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:15,869
quite as loud as that original one okay

922
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,960
and again I got some seedlings going

923
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:18,130
right now that I'm gonna

924
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,230
look through and see what we can find

925
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:23,260
but yeah I mean I'm not a breeder by any

926
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:25,329
stretch like juggling what I think is

927
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,859
delicious you know what I mean and I'd

928
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:29,079
have it in seed form so that I can keep

929
00:36:26,858 --> 00:36:31,299
it around for me I mean I go for me you

930
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:33,069
know and so can even get to that level

931
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:36,099
you just gotta get familiar with all of

932
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:38,950
us absolutely and Maine is made as uh is

933
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:41,140
opening up you know slowly but surely on

934
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:43,569
the REC front the medical program is

935
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:47,170
robust it's been around since 99 we've

936
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:49,000
been here well and you know the

937
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,588
caregiver model was was the thing and we

938
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,460
have a beautiful spice of life in this

939
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:56,380
in this state because of that and is

940
00:36:54,460 --> 00:37:00,010
there anything that you want to get your

941
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:02,050
hands on any breeder well you know I'm

942
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:09,310
seeing the beginnings of now I love dead

943
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:11,589
panhead shout-out to him yeah um yeah

944
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:16,750
peach skunk version two I have yet to

945
00:37:11,588 --> 00:37:20,380
get into the coffee crosses from from

946
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:23,108
from kya from the Pacific Northwest

947
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:25,119
routes cats yeah shout out to him

948
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:29,199
definitely love everything he does and

949
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:32,619
I've got a crossing that right now

950
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:34,659
called dirty Starbucks but I would love

951
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:37,240
to look back at the originals everything

952
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:39,969
from me and G I mean the classic so you

953
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:42,069
know who were really tearing it up right

954
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:43,838
now everybody knows who they are right

955
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:47,140
now I'd love to check some swamp boys

956
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:49,059
gear out bug bug but I haven't I've been

957
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,529
sticking in my own stable but I want to

958
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,989
see other people cultivate with this

959
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:55,990
avocado tech so I can see how those fire

960
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:58,659
strains perform with with this channel

961
00:37:55,989 --> 00:38:00,399
yes holler at me tag me check me out of

962

here so yes please give us all your

963
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,780

968
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,309
studio right now actually where we make

969
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:20,588
music so check out the link in the bio

970
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:22,779
on the music as well you know I think we

971
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:24,519
the medicine influences the music and

972
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,589
vice-versa so it's kind of something

973
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:28,659
dope to look at so shut up the Johnny

974
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:31,449
