1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,399
hi y'all doing who want to talk about

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:09,039
what's going on in santa cruz today

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,240
i got uh i got some updates about what

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,839
went on

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,759
and my understanding is that some of the

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,278
properties that were being hit today

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,719
they had search warrants for and

8
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:26,160
others they didn't

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:29,198
and in one instance that i

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,159
i had discussed with somebody they

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,480
basically use the new laws if

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,759
you guys are in santa cruz county and if

13
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,919
you're on

14
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,599
ben rice's email list you would have

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,320
gotten

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,000
the notice about how what they did was

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,520
they altered all of the legislation

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,079
that allowed them to to abate and find

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,920
people

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,320
and they basically took away a bunch of

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,359
our rights with regards to appeals

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,119
they made the kangaroo court even more

23
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,320
of a kangaroo court

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,479
and they've upped the fines so like now

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,280
every gram of concentrate or every gram

26
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,840
of flour

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,760
you can be fined ten dollars for on top

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,118
of that there's a hundred dollar

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,040
a plant citation so

30
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,879
if you have 400 plants then you're

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,880
looking at 40 000

32
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,640
fine so one of the tactics that was

33
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,158
deployed today was that they showed up

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,159
at somebody's property

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,080
who had everything in a greenhouse there

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,439
was no plants outside or visible from

37
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,000
the sky

38
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,000
but they threatened them and said hey

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,799
you can either self-abate

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,200
or we are going to be back in a couple

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,118
days with the search warrants

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,478
and then you'll have to pay a bunch of

43
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,438
the fines

44
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:43,039
so what i want to do is a i want to talk

45
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,199
to everybody out there about being

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,050
prepared for these visits

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,680
and b uh

48
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:51,840
[Music]

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,118
sort of give you guys some of my ideas

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,920
about how to deal with this

51
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,680
or one of them is do not consent to a

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,560
search the problem is that once you do

53
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,000
so

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,920
regardless of what they're threatening

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,599
you

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,280
you've given up a bunch of your rights

57
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,038
you have very little recourse

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,640
if you have consented to a search so no

59
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,479
matter what they tell you

60
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,839
whether they show you a warrant because

61
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,878
sometimes they're showing you bogus

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,959
bullshit

63
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,399
do not consent to a search i think the

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,598
first thing that everybody out there

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,080
needs to be aware of

66
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,199
and what everybody needs to be doing is

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,680
when you see them

68
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,479
walk up to them with your camera on and

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,400
record it

70
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,039
and whether it's live streaming here on

71
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,280
instagram facebook or any other platform

72
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,318
where it can be up in the cloud make

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,640
sure that you

74
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,759
are recording what is going on record

75
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,559
that interaction

76
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,159
because we need to be able to document

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,039
their harassment and their

78
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,598
encroachment i'm not a lawyer i've read

79
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,120
a bunch of stuff

80
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,799
and i've been doing a lot of listening

81
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,480
audible has a great library

82
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,200
of law books um but i think that there's

83
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,158
grounds

84
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,079
to challenge even a consented search

85
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,079
when the consent was made under the

86
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,360
duress of a threat

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,840
and so you know this is something that

88
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,400
we are always told and i'm guilty

89
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,360
as charged as well that sometimes in the

90
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,158
heat of the moment

91
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,480
when you're surrounded by 12 officers

92
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:19,759
with

93
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:21,598
ar-15s uh jacked up on steroids

94
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,039
and and then bulletproof vest and you're

95
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,919
at home with your family

96
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,039
it becomes really difficult to just say

97
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,359
no

98
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,959
but we need to start saying no we need

99
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,840
to start taking the stance and we need

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,640
to stop

101
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,519
allowing them to walk all over us so

102
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,919
as we prepare for this bullshit that's

103
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,640
going to be coming

104
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:47,039
i want to remind everybody out there do

105
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,439
not consent to a search

106
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,519
if if you need to leave the property

107
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,359
leave if they try to stop you or

108
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,519
ask you a bunch of questions tell them

109
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,840
that you were not discussing your day

110
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,879
that uh and if they continue to try to

111
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,640
hold you

112
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:04,719
back ask them if you are uh

113
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,039
if you are being detained and if you

114
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:10,479
aren't being detained and you aren't

115
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:12,000
uh under arrest then you should be

116
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,518
allowed to leave

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,199
but make sure that you document

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,519
everything and that it's really

119
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,719
important to record them because as we

120
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,079
start to coalesce there is no we yet

121
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,000
right now there's a bunch of us that are

122
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,040
pissed and nobody's actually getting

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,079
together

124
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,120
and organizing but i'm hoping that like

125
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,279
given the given the further encroachment

126
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,360
that some of us are going to wake up and

127
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,519
start to smell the coffee that

128
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,120
laying down and taking this shit isn't

129
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,879
going to get us any further

130
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,160
it's it's just going to lead to more and

131
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,959
if you hear what's coming out of their

132
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,240
mouth

133
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,680
and you hear what's coming out of my

134
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,560
mouth and other people's mouths from the

135
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,079
last year

136
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,160
we warned you guys that this was going

137
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,519
to happen this year and they warned us

138
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
they said that they're going to be back

139
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,758
and

140
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,039
the way and based on conversations that

141
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,120
i've had with people that have been hit

142
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,439
this year is that this isn't the end of

143
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
it

144
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,639
and that they're going to continue

145
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,478
throughout this season and they're

146
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,800
coming back next season but guess what

147
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:04,959
we

148
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,280
we do have the power to make change and

149
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,599
the power to make change has

150
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,679
happened in the past in the past we had

151
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,400
to run a referendum those things are not

152
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,000
cheap

153
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,758
and in the past we've been blessed to

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,918
have big donors and maybe

155
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,120
a lot of those big donors have moved on

156
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,959
to other counties

157
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,478
and you can't blame them because this is

158
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,279
not a climate for

159
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,879
any sort of business to thrive in but

160
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,000
that doesn't mean that we don't have

161
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,560
what it takes to make things happen

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,680
if there was over 300 properties that

163
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,519
were hit

164
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,720
and each one contributed

165
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,159
dollars to a legal fund that's a hundred

166
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,360
and fifty thousand dollars

167
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,240
a hundred and fifty thousand dollars

168
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,360
goes a long way that would allow us to a

169
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,720
um run an initiative or b

170
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,680
file lawsuit i don't have all the

171
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,560
answers but

172
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,478
but i'm just trying to brainstorm and

173
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,879
try to figure out what it is that we can

174
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,159
do

175
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,079
as a community uh to stand up against

176
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,080
the oppression and the encroachment

177
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,439
and i think that that's really going to

178
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,680
begin with us

179
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,439
unifying and even if that's just

180
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,038
something small like forming like a

181
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,600
mountain land owners

182
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,599
mountain homesteaders organization where

183
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
we can start addressing

184
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,199
more than just the cannabis concerns

185
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,759
because i think that when you just talk

186
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,560
about

187
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,400
everything in with regards to cannabis

188
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,839
it falls upon deaf ears

189
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,599
but there's a lot of us out there out

190
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,318
here that have made this our home

191
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,720
and we care about a lot more than just

192
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,039
being

193
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,759
the right to grow clear about fire

194
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,959
safety

195
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,000
and community safety and standards and

196
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,318
health and

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,038
there are a bunch of topics that that we

198
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,439
as growers in the community can

199
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,199
can get around yes we do need lobbyists

200
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,839
but but you know who the best lobbyists

201
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,240
are

202
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,758
we we when we job together we are the

203
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,199
citizens of this county

204
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,199
we are the ones that need to

205
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,598
unite and make our voices heard so that

206
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,720
when we get together

207
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,159
uh we form a voting block it would be

208
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,919
awesome to have

209
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,000
full-time professional hobbyists but the

210
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,799
re i mean lobbyists but the reality is

211
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,800
is that

212
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,560
is that a lot of the money has dried up

213
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
because of the encroachment

214
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,478
because of the seizures because of the

215
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
chopping back of the plants and so a lot

216
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,879
of us are struggling

217
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,839
and so we don't have the money to just

218
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,918
fight them

219
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,839
the same way but we can fight them in an

220
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,439
asymmetric warfare

221
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,279
by finding commonalities with other

222
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,079
organized groups

223
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,879
working to support their causes if in

224
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,639
exchange for them

225
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:45,759
supporting our causes and even if we all

226
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:49,038
if there was 300 of us and we all

227
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,160
and we all uh committed to donating 50

228
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,560
bucks a month

229
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:58,160
to a cause in in a year we've saved

230
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,000
we've already saved uh 300 apiece 300

231
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,240
times 300 that's 90 000

232
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,759
that goes a long way and we need to stop

233
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,560
playing the short game we need to go to

234
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,038
the long game

235
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,759
they like they've been fucking with us

236
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,279
for years

237
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,439
and they will continue to do so so

238
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,959

to get that off my chest that we need we

269
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,159
need to unify

270
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,440
we need to organize we need to start

271
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,600
talking about things

272
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,120

273
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,639

not consent to a search regardless of

277
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,160
whether they have a warrant or not

278
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,639
and make sure that you record your

279
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:39,039
interaction with them

280
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,759

their encroachments the more the game

285
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,680

together we don't have to have the game

287

288
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,839

289
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,240
to work on getting it together and

290
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,800

291
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,000
just taking small actions so again i'm

292
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,319
going to repeat it one more

293
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,399
time or probably the 10th time since

294
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,399

306
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,759
to squeeze you so exercise your right to

307
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,959
remain silent

308
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,159
exercise your right to not consent to a

309
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,199
search

310
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:44,399
um and record everything

311
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,120
and spread the word run tell that

312
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,200
as i contemplate and discuss this with a

313
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,078
bunch of other people i will be

314
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,079
becoming more vocal and active in in

315
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,559
sharing my thoughts

316
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,838
uh with regards to how we can defend

317
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,599
against their encroachment i want

318
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,440
everybody to remember that

319
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,120
while it seems like they're winning

320
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,040
they're actually scared there have been

321
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,560
cases that have come up recently

322
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,039
where the da and the sheriff's office

323
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:12,399
have been purposely withholding evidence

324
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,838
and even against judges wishes why

325
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,839
the only time that you do that is if you

326
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,920
have something to hide and why do they

327
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,800
hide it because they're scared to lose

328
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,919
power so if you do wind up in one of

329
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,159
those situations

330
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,599
i encourage you not to just take the

331
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,480
dismissal

332
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,959
push push if they're trying to hide

333
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,320
something

334
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:35,119
it's worth getting and i'm sure that the

335
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,560
community will be here and if it isn't

336
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,159
i'm looking for and we'll find a way man

337
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,078
much love to all of you thank you for

338
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,000
