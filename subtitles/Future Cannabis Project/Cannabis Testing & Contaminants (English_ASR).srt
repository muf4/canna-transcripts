2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:17,359
testing changed dramatically the skill

3
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:19,710
level of the operator prior to testing

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,800
there was really no way to ascertain

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,439
what was on the cannabis and many of the

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,330
varieties in cannabis today if one wants

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,698
to chemically drive them nutritionally

8
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,889
speaking into a very high level of

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,809
production they become very hyper

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,140
sensitive to environmental issues such

11
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:40,229
as molds and funguses and pathogens such

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,390
as pests and so what you find is that

13
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,099
the amount of cannabis that was

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,308
chemically treated might have been maybe

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,629
88 90 percent of the total and so when

16
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:50,218
we started to really get into testing

17
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:52,109
you started to realize that the

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,550
predominant amount of cannabis grown not

19
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:55,320
just in Humboldt but in the industry in

20
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:57,049
general was actually contaminated with

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,159
products that were meant for

22
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:01,349
horticultural purposes not edible

23
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,839
purposes so ornamentals things you would

24
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,299
use to control the shape of a mom pack

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,340
of betrayal' growth regulators things

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,140
that are designed to create appearance

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,270
and a flower but never meant for human

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,829
ingestion mica butanol which is an equal

29
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:17,099
20 which is designed that to keep

30
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:20,060
powdery mildew off of roses unbelievably

31
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:22,769
concentrated in cannabis and so these

32
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,530
pesticides and fungicides and growth

33
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:27,989
regulators they all started to reveal

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,269
that we had an educational deficiency

35
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:32,310
and I think that what you really got to

36
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:35,069
see was that the growers in Humboldt

37
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,409
County a lot of them were able to start

38
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:39,868
to realize that they would not have an

39
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,880
ability to exist in the future if they

40
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:43,680
didn't start to change their practices

41
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,899
in terms of how does one work with this

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,368
on a regulated level and it was tough

43
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,040
because we don't know what to use as a

44
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:52,078
regulated level so what we did was we

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,280
took Oregon Standards because Oregon

46
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,139
pretty much had a pretty comprehensive

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,180
coverage and it was pretty restrictive

48
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,829
so probably three four years ago we

49
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,080
started looking at Oregon's levels of

50
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:03,149
what they were trying to put into play

51
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,950
and Oregon helped us really start to

52
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,740
understand better like what was the new

53
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,909
allowances of what could be used what

54
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:13,680
was legally allowed to be used and you

55
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:15,479
started to see cultivators start to

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,370
really get into best practices the

57
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,489
integrated pest management concepts took

58
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,980
off the beneficial insects to go off

59
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,350
people made a huge change into organic

60
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,329
methodologies of cultivation because

61
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:30,870
organically driven plants typically have

62
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:33,200
less problems and so it's interesting

63
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,180
but the testing change the production

64
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,819
methodologies not just that customers

65
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,640
get cleaner pot now but there's also a

66
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:43,349
cleaner production methodology in it so

67
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,729
the whole knowledge level increased

68
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:47,180
dramatically that's why I always give

69
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:50,299
Samantha Miller such a shout because

70
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,830
Samantha Miller went on a one-woman show

71
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,290
driving the importance of testing why

72
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,480
you use this how you use these testing

73
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:59,429
methods to improve your production and

74
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,319
now to keep us alive in an industry

75
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,150
that's highly regulated meaning that if

76
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,250
your product doesn't pass the lab test

77
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,860
you can't sell it and so for so many

78
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,020
people who didn't really take that

79
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,540
initiative early they're gonna have to

80
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,590
make the changes now but for a lot of

81
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,629
people in Humboldt

82
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,009
they really made the changes and they

83
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,599
made the changes because they would get

84
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:20,729
the lab results back and they would see

85
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,739
that they were dirty and it started to

86
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:24,780
make an awareness that people don't

87
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,969
understand residual so they don't really

88
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,169
understand half-life of nuclear products

89
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:29,759
and they don't understand residual

90
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,679
contamination from pesticides and

91
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,229
fungicides and exactly how long it takes

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,030
for that material that was sprayed on

93
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:37,919
your cannabis plants to dissipate to a

94
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,409
level that's considered safe and non

95
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,030
detectable and all of a sudden it was an

96
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:43,530
incredible education and people started

97
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,750
to realize that they not only was

98
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,209
selling cannabis that was saturated in

99
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,250
toxic they were living in saturated in

100
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,539
toxic production zones because they were

101
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,639
the ones applying it they're the ones

102
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,900
using it and so all of a sudden the

103
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,208
awareness started to increase

104
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,810
dramatically and you started to see

105
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,969
people may

106
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,449
better common sense decisions just based

107
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:05,340
off of this is in good period and so the

108
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:08,250
testing allowed people to really start

109
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,959
to make educated choices on what we used

110
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,150
in production because prior there really

111
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,459
was no real information and everyone

112
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,829
would say I think it's all gone there's

113
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,149
no residual left and with testing you

114
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,639
found out that you were really running

115
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,409
almost toxic levels of it and so it

116
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,449
started to really key in all these

117
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,419
producers that used it and because I own

118
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:29,550
a dispensary live two of them but their

119
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:30,990
drop-offs for labs which means that

120
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,030
people bring me their products and we

121
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,569
send it off to the lab for for

122
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:37,918
examination so for the nine years that

123
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:41,129
I've been running dispensaries I've seen

124
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,779
between ungodly number lab reports and I

125
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:45,180
know from the lab reports that we've

126
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:48,629
seen an incredible change in what the

127
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:52,590
contaminants are and what kind of drove

128
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:55,560
a lot of it was was concentrates see

129
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:57,539
concentrates became you know almost 48

130
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,168
percent of California's market as of

131
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,840
right now

132
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:04,379
and because concentrates concentrate all

133
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:06,478
things present concentrates started to

134
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,240
reveal residuals in a way that flour

135
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:12,329
testing never did so flour testing let

136
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,939
us understand was it clean as flour but

137
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:17,579
concentrate testing let us understand is

138
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:20,850
it clean as genetic source material

139
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:22,529
meaning where your mom's clean you had

140
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,750
to go all the way back to the material

141
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:27,669
used to create the material you use to

142
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,129
create your product because the

143
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,960
the extraction process concentrates to

144
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:34,480
such a degree that it pulled non

145
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:36,609
detectable amounts from the flower and

146
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,960
made it clearly detectable and clearly

147
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:42,520
non allowable for consumption and so the

148
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,500
concentrated industry is what really

149
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:47,319
started to force people to fix the

150
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,850
problems in the in the back end of the

151
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,579
business because the flower production

152
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:54,250
they they have clean but the mothers had

153
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:57,459
been historically so dirty so for us at

154
00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:00,160
the shop we had by didn't organic

155
00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:01,839
cultivator for a while but I would love

156
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,580
to use the tools that other people get

157
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,919
to use but we realized that at some

158
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:07,300
point when regulation is kicked in

159
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,890
everyone would be under such a

160
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,560
microscope that if we didn't really

161
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,419
practice completely and understand fully

162
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,540
how do you actually control these

163
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,819
problems to a workable degree because

164
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,200
you're not gonna get a sterile system in

165
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:22,120
organics right it's gonna be a

166
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,189
population of beneficial and predator

167
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,439
and so both of them prey and they're

168
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:28,149
gonna work on each other and so

169
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,279
ultimately it's trying to learn what is

170
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:32,169
the allowable balances and to get

171
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,849
customers to understand this to get

172
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,939
people in the real world to understand

173
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,770
it no chemical pesticide fungicide

174
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:42,160
growth regulator issue had really

175
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:45,129
created an artificial world of an

176
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,340
unattainable appearance an unattainable

177
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:50,079
production amount an unattainable

178
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:52,629
ability to have certain cultivars of

179
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,129
certain climactic situations so it

180
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:56,439
allowed people to get around a

181
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:58,569
tremendous amount of true agricultural

182
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:59,829
skill and practice and I think that a

183
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:02,170
lot of humble guys really really

184
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:05,180
practice they went up so all in all

185
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:16,420
testing changed this area dramatically

186
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:16,420
