1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,909
man gray wolf - like ya of man open like

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,519
there was a fierce board a there's a

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,550
couple guys who are like awesome in this

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,219
tech community - because they have

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:17,310
openly like upset a lot of people but

6
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:20,519
like kept this small band of people in

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:23,518
the technology side side of cannabis or

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,989
specifically in processing kind of

9
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,639
hanging on to each other like we all

10
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:28,799
follow each other not AG we see each

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,920
other at all these events there it's not

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,380
a huge group of people and so gray wolf

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,170
and he doesn't even he's not even on

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,120
Instagram which is yeah but he he's an

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,730
old codger that that he's been designing

16
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:47,459
closed loop systems for well he he's an

17
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:50,729
engineer and the closed loop systems

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:54,149
he basically Oaks open source them on

19
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:56,578
the internet so people could so it would

20
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,989
destroy the ability to make patents

21
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,058
around them so then people could

22
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:02,570
actually yeah make the machines

23
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:05,308
themselves so he open-source them very

24
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,728
to just make sure that people would be

25
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:11,298
able to make closed-loop butane designs

26
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:13,859
and don't know if you're familiar with

27
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:19,229
connoisseur concentrates the mister

28
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:23,849
extractor it's a it's a about to say

29
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:26,158
something that might cause drama there

30
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:28,828
we you might there was a big video

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,868
series about how this company had owned

32
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:32,368
all these patents and they tried to

33
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:34,049
patent this stuff but it's really

34
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:39,659
they're not enforceable patents and

35
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:44,479
there's kind of Supercop kind of they

36
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:48,299
they got it and he was he's made a

37
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:53,609
pretty funny video series of him up and

38
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:58,259
this big no drew that's all i know him

39
00:01:53,609 --> 00:02:00,170
as drew and with a couple of pretty

40
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,759
blondes and him in front of a desk

41
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,250
overseeing like LA or something and he

42
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,459
talks about and he gives

43
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,080
an hour-long series about how he's he

44
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:11,810
owns all the patents he's gonna be the

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:16,880
future of the industry and it was like

46
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:22,819
it was pretty cringy yes it was a

47
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,949
groaner yeah the whole thing yeah and I

48
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:27,139
believe that he's actually the gray wolf

49
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:31,129
has been sued for some of the stuff they

50
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:33,500
put out he's had to deal with no

51
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:35,750
actually

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,340
skunk farm had gotten bought from

53
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,439
another company and there's some really

54
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,030
ugly stuff going on around the open

55
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,459
sourcing of that but people have

56
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,159
attacked gray wolf for what he has tried

57
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,870
open source and he's been like copied

58
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,930
all over the industry like if you see a

59
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,180
closed-loop butane extractor like

60
00:02:50,930 --> 00:03:05,450
something on it's probably like taken

61
00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:08,780
from one of his designs almost

62
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:12,738
everything out there is based on a

63
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:15,199
terminator design the terminator was you

64
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:17,900
know a bunch of try clamped spools you

65
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,268
put the material in the small ones they

66
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,430
have passive passive ones that use high

67
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:26,120
you could just put in hot water and ice

68
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,519
and recover your butane but it started

69
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,250
out with just a small little Turpin ATAR

70
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:34,759
series on scum farm research comm and

71
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:37,370
then eventually he started showing an

72
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,379
automated mark to version that they

73
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:44,989
worked on to where it was all pneumatic

74
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:47,449
valves and then they and then they they

75
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:49,069
brought it as the mark 3 was the basic

76
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:51,979
design that everybody's been working

77
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:54,199
that the early design for the mini

78
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:57,949
closed-loop to everybody worked on these

79
00:03:54,199 --> 00:04:00,738
are hydrocarbon closed-loop extraction

80
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:03,319
systems so just getting the oil off the

81
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:06,950
plant yeah so basically zero business

82
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:09,829
you have a column you pack the the

83
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:12,409
material in the column you pass butane

84
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,990
through the column at the bottom it's

85
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:16,500
all collected with oil under vacuum and

86
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,680
then you heat

87
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,790
that and you heat that bottom pot and

88
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,129
then you would pull all the solvent out

89
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:29,189
and then recover it with some type of

90
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:33,509
condenser or a pump that was the fun

91
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:38,120
days of using a peon HVAC recovery pumps

92
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:41,189
and then eventually it moved to TR 21

93
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:47,519
HVAC recovery pumps and then you had

94
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:49,259
companies come in like with the camera

95
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,889
over the name of the company but the CM

96
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:57,300
e pol series of these little stainless

97
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:59,039
boxes for recovering like most of the

98
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,259
pubs like that was a that was the first

99
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,910
approved one I believe there's that and

100
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,129
then there was the pneumatic Haskell's

101
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,930
that were built around that as well but

102
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:09,269
eyes were these most of the pumps that

103
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,040
were used for the first at least five

104
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:12,899
years four years are doing it we're all

105
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,870
like the same kind of pumps you would

106
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:17,429
pump freon into your AC system like

107
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,319
that's the only thing that really fit

108
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,910
that marketplace and a lot of the

109
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,279
technology that you would use I would be

110
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,010
a lot safer was kind of like you had to

111
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,409
go through I was passive they mean a lot

112
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:30,569
of people you could just add heat and

113
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,220
add cooling and one slide trouble like

114
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:34,379
going to specific companies and saying

115
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,270
hey you know this is our company and

116
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:37,529
this is what we do and they wouldn't

117
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,209
even they wouldn't sell us anything

118
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:40,679
they've like no you don't fit the

119
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:43,439
criteria of people that we sell our

120
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,840
products to with like pharmaceutical

121
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,959
supplies you know like even inert you

122
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,819
know getting via bees yeah yeah getting

123
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,209
butane and mass you know like all these

124
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:58,050
limonene yeah and trying to do it

125
00:05:54,209 --> 00:06:00,228
legally you know so yeah as much as

126
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,228
possible
