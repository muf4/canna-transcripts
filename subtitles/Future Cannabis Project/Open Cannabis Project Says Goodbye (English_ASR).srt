00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,099
hi I'm Beth Schecter I'm the executive

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,859
director of the open cannabis project

4
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:18,789
which as many people know is closing on

5
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:23,170
may 31st 2019 I'm joined today by Dale

6
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:26,950
hunt who is on my board and also who is

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,900
a patent lawyer and botanist

8
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:32,859
we're at the cultivation classic we just

9
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:35,859
had our first and last legal advocacy

10
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:37,689
legal and advocacy clinic you know part

11
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:40,509
of the reason we decided that we wanted

12
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:43,748
to do this clinic is because you know as

13
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:44,920
open cannabis project has been has been

14
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:46,600
happening for the past year and a half

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,329
one of the things that we've identified

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,960
as a real need is a need for connecting

17
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:55,210
growers and breeders with with lawyers

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,030
and legal resources lawyer fees are

19
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,460
expensive and so part of what we wanted

20
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,728
to do with this legal clinic is to

21
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,530
really create a resource that made legal

22
00:01:03,728 --> 00:01:07,989
content legal educational content

23
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,579
available to breeders and growers make

24
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:12,399
it available make it really affordable

25
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:16,209
it was a you know 12 to 24 dollar

26
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:17,890
sliding scale donation all of those

27
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:20,828
proceeds are going to the craft cannabis

28
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,868
Alliance and to vote hemp OCP is not

29
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:25,298
taking any of those donations at this

30
00:01:22,868 --> 00:01:27,099
time or ever because we're going away I

31
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:28,420
felt like it was a success and for

32
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:32,199
people who aren't there you know we

33
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,539
covered licenses and patents for strains

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,270
including some open source options we

35
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:40,149
covered interstate commerce and we

36
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:41,798
really talked about hemp and FDA all of

37
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:43,450
these all of these matters all of these

38
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:47,229
laws are really complicated and they

39
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:52,270
surround us every day and they impact us

40
00:01:47,228 --> 00:01:54,670
every single day and you know part of

41
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:57,748
the Botto 'pn cannabis project closing I

42
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,009
mean as people know there has been a big

43
00:01:57,748 --> 00:02:02,739
controversy that has been involved in

44
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:03,849
FiOS and that absolutely and you know

45
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:05,108
coming to light with some of the

46
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:08,318
information that came through on that

47
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:10,840
was a big reason why we closed that's

48
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,250
not the only reason though another

49
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,409
reason just had to do with like ongoing

50
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,060
financial difficulty which I think had

51
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:17,469
to do with people not trusting us which

52
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,060
then had to do with this controversy

53
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:20,389
which was all the more reason to just be

54
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,550
like

55
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:26,059
that doesn't seem like a battle that's

56
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:28,640
worth fighting but really also on top of

57
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,729
that part of the reason why we decided

58
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:34,159
to close is because the conversation is

59
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:38,000
shifting and what we are realizing is

60
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,560
our reality in cannabis is shifting part

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,759
of what's happening right now is that we

62
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,310
are grieving the death of an ideal an

63
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,049
ideal that mainstream cannabis would be

64
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,550
a reflection of the people who brought

65
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,130
it here that's not what's happening and

66
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,480
because that's not what's happening we

67
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:56,209
have to take off our rose-colored

68
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:58,219
glasses and do a better job of working

69
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:01,909
together and organizing ourselves and

70
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:04,489
that involves not only one looking at

71
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:06,469
the landscape very realistically it also

72
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:08,870
involves understanding what the law is

73
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:09,319
and understanding what the law is is

74
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,060
hard

75
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,280
understanding how technology works is

76
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,789
hard understanding genetics and genetic

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,819
data is very hard and so it is you know

78
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:22,609
it's it it's understandable why people

79
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:24,379
don't get it at the same time if we are

80
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,420
going to organize from the ground up and

81
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:28,459
if we are going to really try to succeed

82
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:30,349
right now then part of what we have to

83
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,299
do right now is we do have to have

84
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:34,819
educated conversations and we do have to

85
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:36,140
understand the law and so you know we

86
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:38,120
have in order to have these educated

87
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:41,238
conversations we need to have lawyers

88
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,459
help us to understand like what the eff

89
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,110
is actually going on in this country and

90
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:47,060
the state and this jurisdiction

91
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,170
everywhere and the fact that things are

92
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,400
different by state by state in

93
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:52,518
jurisdiction my jurisdiction just

94
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,590
doesn't help so you know our hope had

95
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,909
been prior to this legal clinic that

96
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,519
this would be a key part of our

97
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:00,560
programming going forward and even

98
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,569
though we're going away there's

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,009
definitely still demand for this and we

100
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,019
are talking to lawyers who are

101
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:07,399
interested in helping with legal clinics

102
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:09,950
like this

103
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,250
we had also begun a project where we

104
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:15,469
were putting together standard open

105
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,839
source and also commercial licenses for

106
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:19,970
breeders and growers who wanted to

107
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,369
license their strains that work is also

108
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,900
going to continue and it will likely

109
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,300
continue with new partners and new

110
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:28,189
directions and certainly be as you know

111
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,400
Democratic from the ground up as

112
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:32,750
possible but in any case you know that's

113
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,408
a very but you know talking about legal

114
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,788
resources

115
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:36,978
breeders and growers is a different

116
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:39,649
conversation than open source your

117
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:41,808
information open source sure strains you

118
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:43,009
know not to say that open source is

119
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:44,838
really giving away your stuff for free

120
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:49,550
but a lot of people see it that way it's

121
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:51,139
just a different I had an idea just at

122
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,860
lunch and I thought hey let's put this

123
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:56,929
in front of a camera because I have said

124
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,598
in fact I said this at Emerald cup when

125
00:04:56,928 --> 00:05:01,579
the panel that we were on that there's a

126
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:07,550
fundamental difference between open

127
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:10,218
source copyright open source software

128
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,278
and open source seeds and I think that's

129
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:15,678
the problem with everything people have

130
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:18,408
have promulgated so far with open source

131
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:21,258
seed licenses and that is that people

132
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:22,728
are doing that in some way that sort of

133
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:25,338
like an alternative to intellectual

134
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:28,908
property protection and here's the

135
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:32,149
difference with open source software

136
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:34,459
that is that starts with a fundamental

137
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:37,848
pre-existence of intellectual property

138
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:40,179
rights because software software has

139
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:43,569
copyright as soon as you create it

140
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:47,149
copyright exists as soon as you create

141
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:48,949
software and that's because there's an

142
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:51,319
international convention to that effect

143
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,879
on the other hand people don't have

144
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,990
intellectual property as soon as they

145
00:05:52,879 --> 00:06:06,349
create a plant right that's the problem

146
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:11,059
and so it's it's yeah you have to have

147
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:13,988
more process right right and so if you

148
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:17,029
just optimistically or altruistically

149
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:19,518
put your seeds out there in some sort of

150
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:21,738
an open source system there it's an

151
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,149
honor system it's a trust system and it

152
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:27,618
requires some kind of community

153
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:30,348
operation a cooperation that is only as

154
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:32,599
strong as all of the members cooperating

155
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:37,579
in that system so this thought I had at

156
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:40,278
lunch was this this whole copyright

157
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:42,110
system didn't exist until there was an

158
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:46,158
international convention to that effect

159
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,080
and that's only a generation old maybe a

160
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:50,800
little bit more than

161
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:52,329
generation exactly exactly when I was in

162
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,569
law school or just coming out of law

163
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:57,788
school that was relatively new at least

164
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:59,468
in the u.s. it used to be that you had

165
00:06:57,788 --> 00:07:03,188
to register your copyright before you

166
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:06,279
had any copyrights so why not

167
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:08,349
why don't we agitate for some breeders

168
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:11,378
rights that exist as soon as you do the

169
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:14,348
breeding in other words you know we

170
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:19,389
could we could create some massive

171
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:21,490
system where there is this you know huge

172
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:23,530
honor system among everybody who

173
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,780
participates in an open-source breeding

174
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:27,369
system but it's only as good as the

175
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:30,429
least honorable member of that system

176
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,899
and G are there any dishonorable members

177
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,978
of the cannabis community well there

178
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:37,658
there might be a few or you know as long

179
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:41,829
as we're lobbying for change

180
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:44,649
why don't we lobby for some kind of an

181
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:46,899
International Convention for rights

182
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:50,168
inherent rights of plant breeders that

183
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,818
they have a right to the ownership of

184
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:55,990
their cultivars as soon as they're

185
00:07:51,819 --> 00:08:00,370
created just like copyright it might be

186
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,840
crazy but why not I mean that is an

187
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,168
amazing idea and I think that that would

188
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,500
help

189
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:08,079
I wonder though are there I mean now I

190
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,430
know I wondered like law student

191
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,189
questions not that I'm a law student but

192
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,098
it's like okay are there existing is

193
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:16,120
there an existing reason in place why

194
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:18,128
you know inventor ship does not

195
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,408
automatically assigned to other things

196
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:21,550
anyway including plants like is this

197
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:24,069
something that head that has been

198
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:29,560
considered and rejected because of X or

199
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:33,870
Y you know I don't know it's it could be

200
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,860
hard to prove but on the other hand I

201
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,538
don't know maybe nobody's just ever

202
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,829
asked the question I don't want to give

203
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:48,669
myself that much credit for being

204
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:51,129
original but I see one of the one of the

205
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:53,439
differences between a utility patent and

206
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:55,539
a plant patent is there's quite a bit of

207
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,370
debate with a utility patent about

208
00:08:55,539 --> 00:09:00,929
whether what you think you invented is

209
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,669
actually new right and so that's a

210
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:03,838
purpose of a patent examiner you have to

211
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:05,939
go through this whole elaborate

212
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,040
examination process to prove that what

213
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,779
you think you invented is new

214
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,028
you have to they have to this

215
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:13,919
examination they do a search they they

216
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:17,039
look at all the so-called prior art and

217
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:21,088
you establish whether it's new on the

218
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:23,309
other hand if you breed a plant pretty

219
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:25,709
much by statistical definition

220
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:29,909
whatever you do in that breeding process

221
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:34,679
is new the genetic act of doing a sexual

222
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:36,778
cross and creating a new new cultivar a

223
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:39,059
new cross it's not necessarily a

224
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:42,259
cultivar until it's stable but that new

225
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:44,399
strain that f1 is genetically new

226
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:45,088
statistically it's impossible that it's

227
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,120
not new

228
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:49,860
and so that's original and but it's the

229
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,429
same theory of copyright if I create

230
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,649
something if I write something new as

231
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:58,289
long as it's long enough to be new its

232
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,769
original right so the originality is

233
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:03,329
what constitutes that it's it's

234
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:07,559
deserving of a it's being deserving of a

235
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:12,200
copyright and to me at least you know in

236
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:13,409
my post-lunch addled brain it seems like

237
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,500
yeah

238
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:17,730
it seems like at least theoretically

239
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,769
you've cleared the novelty her the

240
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:23,519
originality hurdle there's no

241
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:26,250
examination process needed so as long as

242
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,399
you can establish ownership you should

243
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:32,429
be entitled to your rights just like a

244
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,708
copyright and if you have the automatic

245
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:37,620
existence of some intellectual property

246
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:39,149
then you should be able to have an open

247
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,659
source system that would actually work

248
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:45,659
and so then you know I've been dubious

249
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:47,100
about open source systems for seeds

250
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:51,809
which is why I haven't really jumped

251
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:55,519
into it not because I don't support it

252
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:55,519
just because of its workability I

253
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:02,059
I mean I'm in favor of it in concept

254
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:05,120
it's just I've been dubious about its

255
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:08,000
workability because it's only is because

256
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,810
it's only as workable as its least

257
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,149
honourable member but you know this this

258
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:17,989
could work in this in a very similar way

259
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:21,259
to open-source software well that is one

260
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,580
idea there are many ideas out there many

261
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:26,090
ideas out there and I know that people

262
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,500
have thoughts feelings we've heard from

263
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,300
a ton of people who've said that they

264
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,360
are sad that open cannabis project is

265
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:34,729
closing we hear you

266
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,759
we're sad too and I think we're also

267
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:40,940
ready to let go of some baggage and move

268
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,159
forward and some nimbler ways and to do

269
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:46,400
so from the community up and so for

270
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:48,259
people who are interested in thinking

271
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,919
about these ideas being part of the next

272
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:54,919
step one go to open cannabis project org

273
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:58,819
slash surveys there is one very simple

274
00:11:54,919 --> 00:12:01,159
survey now that we are going to be

275
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,330
putting out some more going going

276
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,949
forward because it's simple sort of

277
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,970
sunset survey right now and if you have

278
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:09,440
thoughts about what we should do when

279
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,810
after we close we'd love to hear them

280
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,970
and you know if you have just general

281
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:16,939
thoughts send us a note at info at open

282
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,680
cannabis project org we look forward to

283
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,380
hearing from you and to building

284
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,719
something new together it's already kind

285
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:25,830
of the seeds are planted things are

286
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:36,239
happening

287
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:36,239
