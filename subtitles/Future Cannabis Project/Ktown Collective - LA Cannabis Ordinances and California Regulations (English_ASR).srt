2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:15,540
city of Los Angeles can't even get their

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,190
original pre-ics license properly we're

4
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,788
all struggling to meet a deadline in

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,410
August to have our annual licenses and

6
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,720
you that's just waiting for the you know

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,000
the Department of cannabis regulations

8
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,009
in Los Angeles once it goes from Los

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,460
Angeles kicks it up I think the state's

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,570
a little bit more ready to accept it but

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,308
because everything's based on a

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,890
municipality and where that's going

13
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:39,539
that's where there's just a big tangle I

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,480
know there's been a lot of

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,689
investigations for politicians taking

16
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,398
money under the table trying to direct

17
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:49,500
licenses into different people's hands

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,079
you know there's a lot of dirty money I

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:57,539
think we're seeing that all over the

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,609
country where politicians are not doing

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,070
the right thing and everyone wanted to

22
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,140
say oh here's this social equity program

23
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,000
and everyone's got a chance and I'm so

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,219
sorry about your injustice that happened

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,890
to you and same thing happened to me I

26
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:13,170
was arrested in 2012 why am i any

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,489
different in the amount that I went

28
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,890
through and what I lost

29
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:19,289
why is my social injustice any different

30
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,750
than someone else's I mean that's not

31
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,729
fair well your your pre-ics so it's not

32
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,500
even relevant to you yeah because I

33
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:28,140
could go back and get more licenses and

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,180
I can put put them under my name and I

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,219
would be my social equity partner yeah I

36
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,960
would love to be partners with me I've

37
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,868
been partners with me in cannabis for

38
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:41,699
over 12 years so I make an excellent

39
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:43,500
cannabis partner but okay so specific so

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,359
you're you're still operating with a

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,040
temporary license right now we still

42
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,409
operate with a temporary license we

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,920
actually submitted to put in our annual

44
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:55,770
license with the DCR believe last April

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,109
this past April a few weeks ago it's

46
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:59,429
still in a process I wouldn't see them

47
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:04,680
doing anything with that application

48
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:06,689
before July 1st maybe they said 60 days

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,030
and then they wanted another 30 days and

50
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:11,459
then that license gets kicked up to the

51
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,419
state our state license was extended out

52
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,209
to August right now

53
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:18,579
so as we get to that August deadline in

54
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:22,150
2019 the steadily they'll have to issue

55
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,620
another temp or the city will actually

56
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,750
do stuff in will actually start to get

57
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,480
go through the licensing process and are

58
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,459
all the pre IC o---- people in LA kind

59
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,500
of in the same boat as you every once in

60
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,479
the same way there's no permanent

61
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,818
license of admission to anyone in city

62
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,299
of Los Angeles and so when you all sit

63
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:43,539
down and talk shop on this topic what's

64
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,760
kind of the it's laughable it's really

65
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:49,030
laughable it's embarrassing it's

66
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,159
laughable you would think that with the

67
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,830
amount of knowledge that sits in a room

68
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:56,379
because Herb Wesson is also president of

69
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,200
City Council her Westman him his office

70
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:01,539
and his staff have been so with the

71
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,369
doors opened for everyone and us to come

72
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:05,560
in and talk about problems and how the

73
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,750
ordinance needs to be crafted and

74
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,819
changed and things of that for it's open

75
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,469
doors is that they've been like that you

76
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:14,708
do run in still to the council people

77
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:17,590
that put a roadblock up and instead of

78
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:20,349
seeing where the positivity and how

79
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,090
things could grow and the tax revenues

80
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:24,280
that everyone is so busy trying to go

81
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,859
after being able to collect those tax

82
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,299
revenues for the benefit of the

83
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:29,829
communities I mean everyone's already

84
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:32,530
trying to reallocate where the tax

85
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,450
revenues go that are better derived from

86
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,340
cannabis I mean Gavin Newsom was on the

87
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:39,009
news last week saying he'd like to take

88
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,340
the legal cannabis revenues and pay for

89
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:44,019
diapers I mean and you know how many

90
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,450
places do you want to take you know you

91
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:47,950
squeeze a turnip you can't get only get

92
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:50,828
so much blood out of something but

93
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:53,048
specific to LA so first of all how many

94
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,620
pre ICO shops are there who are waiting

95
00:03:53,049 --> 00:04:00,760
to get everyone no one's got a permanent

96
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:07,349
I believe it's about note JP about 135 I

97
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:10,090
believe there's not a live process no

98
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:12,129
and think about everyone said the reason

99
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,109
that they license to the pre-ics was

100
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:15,669
because we had the experience we had the

101
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:18,189
paperwork in order we had everything

102
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:20,620
together so those applications were

103
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:22,389
probably the easiest to source some of

104
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,009
them may be missing certain documents

105
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:26,339
that you had to go back just because of

106
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:29,139
an attrition overtime or moving

107
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:30,638
raids and everything that we were thrown

108
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:32,348
at us for all these years

109
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,750
documents got lost but they've made

110
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:37,389
exceptions for them what's holding up

111
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,720
this the Department of what cannabis

112
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:42,908
regulations in Los Angeles I really have

113
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,889
no clue though two times I've visited

114
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,810
down there to pick something up or or

115
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:49,598
get a pass or give us admit some

116
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,339
paperwork no one was there I literally

117
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:55,930
sat in a lobby it was like an empty

118
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:58,029
office it's it's it's I guess if the

119
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,280
sometimes you need to get a business

120
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:02,408
person in a room when you're trying to

121
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:05,019
organize like an industry because it is

122
00:05:02,408 --> 00:05:07,449
a business so that you have some kind of

123
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:09,668
leadership direction on that it's not

124
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:12,250
always just a policy driven thing and

125
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:14,258
still got to have the nuts and bolts in

126
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,379
the engine to make the car drive right

127
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:21,598
so what's the worst case scenario that

128
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:23,800
they don't get their act together and

129
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:27,279
the worst case scenario if they don't

130
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,500
extend the temporary licensing so I the

131
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,000
city the city and the state if they

132
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,250
don't extend that out if they can't

133
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,218
process their paperwork on time they're

134
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,379
gonna have to make another band-aid and

135
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:40,209
California seems just like that's their

136
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,370
favorite thing to do let's have another

137
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:44,649
band-aid well it's not work worried

138
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,389
about traffic and infrastructure and

139
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:48,310
things like that let's just knock it out

140
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,348
and take care of 18 months three years

141
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,300
we'll figure it out in five years what

142
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:54,218
we messed up then and that's such a

143
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,069
crazy way I mean they're a businessman

144
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:59,050
builds business from the foundation and

145
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:02,050
you have grassroots and you really build

146
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,699
a foundation that's part of why the pre

147
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,430
I cos I've been in the position they are

148
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:08,139
I've had Koreatown collective since 2008

149
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,408
you don't think I have a big foundation

150
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:13,180
and people really respect and come back

151
00:06:11,408 --> 00:06:15,009
to us because we explain the medicines

152
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,718
we explain to them what's going to

153
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:19,090
happen where we try to help them with

154
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:20,860
their experience we really question to

155
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:24,038
ask what is it that you're looking to

156
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,408
treat everyone was talking about adult

157
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:28,810
use in recreational most of those adult

158
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:30,519
use recreational patients really needed

159
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,490
cannabis and they're really giving up

160
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:35,769
some of their other pharmaceutical drugs

161
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:38,439
the whole part of where we were supposed

162
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:39,620
to be going with prop 64 was education

163
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,180
and knowledge and

164
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,240
powering the people to be able to make

165
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,160
better decisions so that they would have

166
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,290
easy exposure and easy access to

167
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,389
cannabis so that they're like to improve

168
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,370
their lives and all they're doing is

169
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:54,168
making it harder and harder with the

170
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,959
taxes that are come on it's basically a

171
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:58,609
sin tax a person that needed cannabis to

172
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,009
survive every day so they weren't on

173
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,860
painkillers or opiates or taking other

174
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,810
kinds of drugs they can't afford their

175
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,060
cannabis anymore by the time you tax it

176
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,280
they can go find a guy in the street and

177
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,220
go get it from their guy and not pay the

178
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:16,219
taxes but we don't see the support from

179
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,080
the policymakers and the government to

180
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,720
try to get rid of that and to get rid of

181
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:25,509
the a little shops and uh and illegal

182
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:28,039
guys so taking into account the

183
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:31,279
traditional heat like real patients like

184
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:31,879
the little old lady arthritis people

185
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,918
with cancer

186
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,319
what are those cuz you know them

187
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,689
personally what are those people telling

188
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,069
you specifically they come to our store

189
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:42,139
they come to us right in there they've

190
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,969
got tears in our eyes because we can't

191
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,819
even give them free stuff anymore

192
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,200
we can't even pass along the samples yes

193
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:49,879
I'm fortunate because some of the

194
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,379
companies I do will leave me samples

195
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,329
behind in there they'll do them at a

196
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:55,668
discounted price whatever and then we

197
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:57,469
discount them to our patients so whether

198
00:07:55,668 --> 00:07:59,149
they come in and they get something in a

199
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,250
regular size I can give them another

200
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:04,038
size for a dollar we've tried to come

201
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,319
around those things my partner and I we

202
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:08,329
kind of circumvented the whole THC

203
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,459
process drew a line in the sand and

204
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:12,649
opened a tee a CBD store two doors down

205
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:15,379
called the antidote because so many

206
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:17,060
people that have a stigma about THC or

207
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:19,490
cannabis and didn't know what it was

208
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,470
well now they can come get some pain

209
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,918
relief and get different types of things

210
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:27,260
and have no worries about having a

211
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:29,149
psychoactive effect of what's going on

212
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:30,800
but actually get that cannabinoid into

213
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:33,399
their system tell balance and regulate

214
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,219
their system so it seems like from a

215
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:39,379
retail operational standpoint that CBD

216
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:42,560
business has a lot is a lot more

217
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:48,019
unencumbered to just be a retail their

218
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:49,578
CBD the CBD store it's like back to my

219
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:51,620
hope again where I used to spend my time

220
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:52,969
in k-town and we were vertically

221
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,460
integrated and we

222
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,320
we literally took our clone to cut our

223
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:01,670
clones and we grew them all the way out

224
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,379
we grew them all the way out so that

225
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:06,289
whether it turned you you left with

226
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:07,549
flower in a jar or you had an edible or

227
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:09,439
you had a concentrate and we were

228
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:11,990
vertically integrated that's what I

229
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,520
recreated going back into CBD world do I

230
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,330
know I got to move fast

231
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,980
yes we created a skincare company

232
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,200
there's no one else in the space like

233
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,000
what we have right now do I know to run

234
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,280
fast and go fast and get it out there

235
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,019
and market it and brand it yes I do do I

236
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,939
think the regulations will be there in

237
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:31,279
three to five years a hundred percent

238
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,710
but the good news is is that I'm coming

239
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,659
from THC world so I know I already know

240
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,940
the rules and regulations so all the

241
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:39,500
testing and all those little things

242
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:46,760
you're supposed to be doing along the

243
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:50,750
way we're already doing in CBD world is

244
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,309
it more fun in CBD world yes I can't

245
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,320
think I'm not dealing with the bullshit

246
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:59,599
I have three to five years to not deal

247
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,920
with the bullshit I'm sure I'm sure the

248
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
government wants us to figure out how to

249
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:06,199
get their piece of that market as well

250
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,639
I'm not sure how they're gonna do it I'm

251
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,129
not sure how they're gonna track and

252
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:12,049
trace the THC because we've been in

253
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:13,519
place to track and trace every single

254
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:15,589
thing and they still don't have their

255
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,409
metric system ready to go and I'm not

256
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,790
going to be their first guinea pig

257
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:26,389
there's obviously a lot of talk about

258
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:28,219
the unlicensed retail shops really I

259
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:30,139
don't really see them as much but you

260
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:35,240
know I'm on my same path every day I

261
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:37,370
know that the LAPD is hard at work and

262
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,009
kudos to them because they actually

263
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:42,110
understand the cannabis industry in Los

264
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:44,960
Angeles better than anyone else they've

265
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:48,019
gone from our worst nightmare and our

266
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,519
enemies to our biggest supporters I mean

267
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:53,569
I can tell you the one to my district

268
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,610
have been amazing and supportive of me I

269
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,620
think that they have every right to go

270
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,970
in and shut them down they've now they

271
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,669
can work with the power company so they

272
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,440
go in they just cut the power first and

273
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:05,599
then they're like they take everything

274
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,569
but the unlicensed

275
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,930
are not your personal biggest pain point

276
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:14,149
as a business operator I don't I don't

277
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:15,828
feel the pain from those those shops I

278
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:19,458
think it's unfair because they're not

279
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:21,138
paying the taxes that's very unfair but

280
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:24,049
there's so much unfair in this world

281
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:28,039
like I can't tackle that that's really

282
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:29,479
LAPD and the city has to do that and

283
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:30,259
they're not going to get anything

284
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,819
straightened

285
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:34,339
that's this whole thing when everyone

286
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:36,019
wanted to just legalize cannabis they

287
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:38,449
didn't like think about maybe we should

288
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:40,730
fix the system we had first so we'd have

289
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:42,349
some infrastructure to build on and then

290
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,209
go forward but everyone was such a know

291
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,009
her E and government wanted the tax

292
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,778
revenues and they ended up shooting

293
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:51,289
themselves in the foot are you going to

294
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:53,208
be doing delivery yes we are we're

295
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:54,588
setting it up we're first launching our

296
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:57,198
delivery we're going to partner with

297
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:59,149
someone and it'll be like top tier stuff

298
00:11:57,198 --> 00:12:01,099
so they can get a lot larger amounts and

299
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:02,600
then we'll roll out right behind that

300
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,269
we'll roll that where you can get

301
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,069
deliveries from k-town Direct and that's

302
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:09,500
where your brands that's where your

303
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:11,059
loyalty that's where all 12 years of

304
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,039
everything I've done in my community

305
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:14,629
will make me different than everyone

306
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,958
else because people will trust what I

307
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:20,208
put in them back also on-site

308
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:22,399
consumption when they finally approve it

309
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:24,528
for us we would go next door we're next

310
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,438
door to hookah bar so we've already

311
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:30,139
spoken to because you know it's like

312
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:32,299
five places on one lot so we've already

313
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:35,629
spoken and because I ended up being the

314
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:37,818
mayor of my community block I just like

315
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:39,379
said you have this in that you know they

316
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:41,719
don't run the hookah lounge really in

317
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:44,269
the daytime I said you got this part I

318
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,980
got my part and shook hands and just

319
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:48,769
wait for the licenses to come out for

320
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:55,899
the city of Los Angeles which I don't

321
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:58,029
think will be anytime soon 2020 No

322
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:00,009
I don't know even though I'll have an

323
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:02,439
annual license by 20 times that day

324
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:04,360
something I'm sorry but Los Angeles is

325
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,060
your biggest market it's got the most

326
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,370
people it's really embarrassing it's I I

327
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:10,569
think that we need to fix the things

328
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,139
we're doing before we start creating

329
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:16,810
more stuff yes I'm on the board of

330
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:19,899
glocca and SEC the Southern California

331
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:22,629
that's Adam Spikers group he's great

332
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,009
he's I will tell you and this is you can

333
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:24,759
quote me on the this if you're that's

334
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:27,309
still running

335
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:30,330
Adam Spiker really has done more to

336
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:33,639
bring cannabis in the cannabis industry

337
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:35,170
not just the dispensary owners which are

338
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:37,269
still like there and that's why I'm on

339
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:39,659
the board but the manufacturers the

340
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:42,519
cultivators and the politicians together

341
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:45,759
better than anyone else and I've been

342
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:48,039
part of the Calaca since 2008 I'm on

343
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,509
their board now and although we were

344
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:51,669
ordinance and things like that you

345
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:54,309
always had so much internal fighting

346
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:56,799
within the industry and this industry is

347
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:59,259
not gonna survive if it doesn't come

348
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,379
together and act as a community it's its

349
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:04,809
own village and Los Angeles really needs

350
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:08,470
to get their act together because so

351
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:11,469
much is being lost from California Los

352
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,970
Angeles because of the revenues I mean

353
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,860
how do you not have these businesses up

354
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,779
and running in downtown LA already I

355
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,950
mean all that income would be coming in

356
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:20,110
there all those employees would be

357
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,670
spending money in those local stores

358
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,649
they would still be to the gas stations

359
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:26,079
there to the little grocery stores to

360
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:29,439
all the food shops to all the food

361
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,450
trucks I mean it's crazy like and I will

362
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,570
tell you that Ron galperin who's the

363
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:37,000
City Comptroller he gets it and he's

364
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,770
probably done more behind the scenes to

365
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,929
get the engine going than anyone else

366
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:44,199
there I mean her blessings been there

367
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:47,529
but he has his own motives as well but I

368
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,320
think pure motives Ron galperin is like

369
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:52,629
a great he's been a great advocate for

370
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,310
the cannabis movement could you talk to

371
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:57,860
a minute about Blanca

372
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:59,088
and because you you you've been involved

373
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,970
with him for a long time right

374
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:03,709
so um and I've been really interested

375
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,360
for a long time and so I've been writing

376
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:08,359
about in covering the different groups

377
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,879
since 20 just 2015 but even since then a

378
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,568
lot has happened what's keeping blocker

379
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,899
together and what is it doing now I mean

380
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:20,120
I'll be honest it's really a framework

381
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:23,028
the people that the board members or the

382
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,028
winterly holding it together there was a

383
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:28,009
division that happened and when we

384
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:30,528
finished after they did prop D and

385
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:31,999
everyone had come together there were

386
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:35,659
some compromises made that shouldn't

387
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:38,839
have been made back in 2013 I believe it

388
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:40,818
was it was when we voted prop D and

389
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,279
there was a split there was there were

390
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:45,799
some splits that were made and there was

391
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,808
another group that ucba and they split

392
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:51,429
over here and then you had your old

393
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:54,558
traditional Galactica members over here

394
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:56,688
glocca came about and started to embrace

395
00:15:54,558 --> 00:16:01,458
more of the industry in the village and

396
00:15:56,688 --> 00:16:02,750
taking a look at things item by item

397
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,938
you couldn't just throw everything into

398
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,068
a basket you can't just arbitrarily say

399
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:09,318
no one else can have a delivery license

400
00:16:07,068 --> 00:16:11,389
that's not the way we live in the United

401
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,588
States of America no matter what so you

402
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:13,549
still have certain principles that you

403
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:17,660
have to uphold

404
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:20,299
but the glocca became more to try to

405
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:23,448
involve themselves we became part of the

406
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:25,458
SCC which was at of Spikers group ucba

407
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:27,620
still operates over here by themselves I

408
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:30,258
don't have any issues whatever because I

409
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,269
always lived in Milan hula-hoop so I can

410
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:34,339
go to them and talk to them I understand

411
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:36,230
what they're trying to do but also there

412
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:37,399
are a lot of them are micro licenses so

413
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,438
they have their own brands that they're

414
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,299
trying to do they're cutting their nose

415
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:43,009
off to spite their face because who's

416
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:46,909
going to take their brand outside their

417
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:49,959
own little hula-hoop and what's the

418
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:52,789
purpose it's it's not going to work so

419
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:54,558
Adam has been like a real big spearhead

420
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:56,419
of trying to work together but there's

421
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:58,578
so much backstabbing and people don't

422
00:16:56,419 --> 00:17:02,628
realize that you can't a lot more flies

423
00:16:58,578 --> 00:17:04,879
with honey than you do vinegar that it's

424
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:08,269
it's the right thing so Glock is like

425
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,319
kind of holds on a lot of us did going

426
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:12,288
to the SCC

427
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:15,408
so we're there and very supportive I

428
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:17,148
came onto the board at SCC because I was

429
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,470
supposed to represent the dispensary

430
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:20,778
owners and try to get everyone to

431
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,149
understand like if she there's a reason

432
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:25,699
why she's doing this and giving my time

433
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:27,198
and I kind of like fallen off sometimes

434
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:29,899
had some personal stuff going on in my

435
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,950
own life and then I'm like no Adamson so

436
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:32,949
much if I can help him
