1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,260
[Music]

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,850
I'm gonna give you a quick update on

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,990
what is happening out there in the world

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:25,500
[Music]

5
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:27,899
so the county so for those of you who

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,370
know Jonathan's vet CO and Angeles

7
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,799
Emeralds have been working really really

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,899
hard on the county they put in a

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,969
fantastic working group together of

10
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,250
people from all sides of the table and

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,500
they spent I don't know something like

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,960
eight weeks and five six hours a day

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,560
really really breaking this down and

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,700
they made an incredible incredible

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,100
recommendation to the Board of

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,530
Supervisors so that those

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,840
recommendations are really awesome and I

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,329
gotta say there are some parts of it

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,620
that people aren't going to agree with

20
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,259
but there are some great parts of it as

21
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:03,089
well so I think we're gonna hopefully

22
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:04,920
hopefully see some good stuff come from

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,890
the county the not good stuff is gonna

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,998
happen - let me give you a quick idea of

25
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,590
what's happened in the county so they're

26
00:01:11,998 --> 00:01:15,358
gonna expect it right now they're

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,920
expected to vote on these regulations

28
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:19,138
December 19th

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,909
the reason that they're waiting so long

30
00:01:19,138 --> 00:01:22,679
is because they're not really going to

31
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,770
take any kind of applications for

32
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:27,629
licenses until like July June or July of

33
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:30,748
next year so if you are in

34
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,489
unincorporated parts of LA County your

35
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:34,858
application process is gonna start

36
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:36,778
somewhere around December January and

37
00:01:34,858 --> 00:01:39,658
you're looking at licensing somewhere

38
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:41,009
around summer so as opposed to the

39
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,779
cities which are moving a little bit

40
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,578
quicker and are gonna start taking

41
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:46,670
applications some of them as soon as

42
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:48,958
some of them now are taking applications

43
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,368
the county is gonna hold off for a

44
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,950
little bit so any of that

45
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:54,959
unincorporated LA County that stuff's

46
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,399
gonna hold off but you know keep tabs on

47
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,200
it if you don't know what's going on

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,939
reach out look up Angeles Emeralds

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,560
online and you can get in contact and

50
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:02,848

51
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:09,810

52
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:11,430
to find out more Angeles Emeralds like

53
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:16,620

55
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,659
okay so that's the County oh and one

56
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:23,399
good thing about the county there has

57
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:26,669
been a recommendation that was passed

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,319
for a pathway for existing operators so

59
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:31,049
should you or any of your clients or

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,060
contacts or friends have that have been

61
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,410
operating you know as legal as you can

62
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,390
in LA County

63
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:38,699
unincorporated there will be a pathway

64
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:42,629
for them to get to applications so

65
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:45,269
that's gonna be great okay LA City LA

66
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,250
City has issued all bunch of regulations

67
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,250
and that's in there they're just in

68
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,219
discussion right now this Thursday the

69
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,960
21st is a Planning Commission meeting if

70
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:57,719
you want to learn more about it go

71
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,240
online and look up La cannabis task

72
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,039
force you will find as much information

73
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,860
as you can they have newsletter they

74

75
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,170
can go and you know participate and

76
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:13,259
support so that is LA City that's the

77
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:15,359
short story of LA City where we are

78
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,979
right now West Hollywood was Hollywood

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,780
people like rob myself we've been

80
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,909
working very very hard in the City of

81
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,740
West Hollywood to get them to you know

82
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,810
create some really good policy and I

83
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,760
think we've done quite an excellent job

84
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,229
I have to say and I think we're gonna

85
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,449
have some incredible policy here in West

86
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:32,849
Hollywood we're gonna see on-site

87
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:34,289
consumption lounges actual individual

88
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:36,090
lounges we're gonna see on Kai's on-site

89
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:38,759
consumption for retail we're gonna see

90
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,259
delivery we're gonna see infusion places

91
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,429
so that if you want to have a making

92
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:42,929
this up if you want to have a cupcake

93
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,420
place and you want to have a commercial

94
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,260
kitchen in the back and infuse you could

95
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:47,849
do that you won't be able to do your

96
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,679
extractions here probably but you can

97
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:51,419
certainly do your infusions here so this

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,040
city is gonna probably have some really

99
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:55,349
really forward-thinking cannabis policy

100
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:58,049
where the ordinance itself the draft

101
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:59,219
will be read in early November so you

102
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,230
know we got a couple months before we

103
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,909
actually have that but we pretty much

104
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:04,139
know what's going to be in it so I just

105
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,579
want to congratulate the City of West

106
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,979
Hollywood for doing really an excellent

107
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,510
job and hopefully leading California in

108
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,509
great policy yes

109
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,560
so the question is how is Hollywood

110
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,890
addressing social lounges as opposed to

111
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,149
what with those just in regards to the

112
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,769
state right okay

113
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:32,229
so the simple question a simple answer

114
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:34,719
to that is the state is not going to

115
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,280
issue on-site consumption licenses they

116
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,140
will adhere to it but they're not

117
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:39,879
actually there's no license you can get

118
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,079
from the state for on-site consumption

119
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,829
you'll be able to get that from your

120
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:48,149
city if your city issues them so as it

121
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:51,519
relates to its two full Joel its its

122
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:54,759
standalone consumption lounges like this

123
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,069
is a bar right standalone bar would be

124
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,990
like this except no alcohol so that

125
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:02,019
would be one way to do it the other way

126
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:05,139
to do it is if this place as an example

127
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:07,060
was able to apply for a retail license

128
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,759
excuse me a a consumption license and

129
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,100
somehow worked it out with alcohol

130
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,480
beverage Commission with ABC that's

131
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,920
gonna be the challenge but I think that

132
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,030
the city is gonna have a lot to do with

133
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,009
that the city is gonna come and take a

134
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:21,759
look at who wants licenses if it's a

135
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:23,349
hotel bar spa yoga studio restaurant

136
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,029
whatever it is so this is gonna be

137
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,340
figured out but I think we're gonna see

138
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:28,719
that first in this city and hopefully

139
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:30,369
they'll set some good standards for the

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,600
rest of the the rest of the states so

141
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,000
we're really really happy about that

142
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,439
because we all need let's face it even

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,569
though it sounds fun to have one we

144
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,610
actually need safe places to consume if

145
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:41,019
you're gonna sell you have to have a

146
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,360
place to consume and if you have

147
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:44,859
tourists where are they gonna go they

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,020
can't go to a hotel because it's not

149
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,670
legal there so you have to provide a

150
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:49,839
safe place for people to consume

151
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,430
otherwise you're sending them back out

152
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:55,959
under the streets so we don't want to do

153
00:05:51,430 --> 00:06:00,040
that okay finally I just want to bring

154
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:01,959
up a B 1578 which some of you know is

155
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,300
the assembly bill that was put on by

156
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:06,699
Assemblymember Rob Reggie Jones Sawyer

157
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,050
who's from South LA and he created a

158
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,969
bill that has already passed the

159
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,699
California State Assembly which is

160
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,230
basically keep Trump and sessions out of

161
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:16,269
our legal cannabis business it's a

162
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:18,160
federal non-cooperation bill it's

163
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:21,789
already passed the assembly we needed to

164
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,710
pass the Senate it's currently in hold

165
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,750
it took in a holding position it's not

166
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:28,209
dead by any means we're gonna either

167
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:31,360
know at the end of next week or in

168
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:31,629
January if it's going to pass through

169
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,189
this

170
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:36,069
if passes through the Senate we're in

171
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:38,350
great shape what's gonna happen is at

172
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:40,360
that time when it whether it's next week

173
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,370
or in January there's going to be a call

174
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,860
to action and we're going to need to get

175
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,780
engaged and start calling getting on the

176
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,699
phone and calling all these senators

177
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:51,849
from California and telling them how to

178
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:53,649
vote so if anybody wants to be a part of

179
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,689
that list and you want to contribute

180
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:57,939
when the call comes

181
00:06:55,689 --> 00:07:00,009
there is a special list up at the front

182
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:01,480
where you checked in it has nothing to

183
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:03,310
do with the mailing list it won't be a

184
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,590
mailing list thing it's just so I

185
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,810
actually can have your information and

186
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:10,000
know who to contact when we get that

187
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,500
call so if you want to be involved you

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,689
want to do something sign up on that

189
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,250
list and then I'll hold on to that and

190
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:17,170
let you know when I get that call

191
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,089
because we really really need to keep

192
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,580
those guys out of our legal cannabis

193
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:24,729
business once we're licensed they should

194
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:26,889
have no part of this so just keep that

195
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:30,640
in mind so that's a be 1578 so that's

196
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:33,699
coming soon okay

197
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,219
beyond that the state is going to issue

198
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:38,649
emergency regulations in sometime in

199
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,080
November there's going to be a five day

200
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:42,879
comment period for that that's it so

201
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:44,829
once those new regulations come out if

202
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,139
you're interested in commenting you have

203
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:50,529
five days and then after that it's all

204
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:53,019
over for at least for a while so keep

205
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:54,909
don't if you're not on any lists get on

206
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:56,379
lists and find out when this stuff is

207
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,810
happening so that you could be a part of

208
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:05,219
it

209
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:05,220
