1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,079
I see Barcelona's international I mean

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:18,990
the epicenter of grow and the whole

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,698
social scene in the culture of Europe

4
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:22,528
and correct me if I'm wrong I really

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,939
feel it's coming out of Spain now I mean

6
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,649
like Amsterdam almost feels like the

7
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,359
tourist trap compared to the

8
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,070
experiential in Barcelona right well

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,199
yeah it's it's true there's so much

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,609
stuff going on in in Barcelona there's

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,649
all these tears whether it's the coffee

12
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:36,479
shops or as medical or if it's the CBD

13
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,660
grows or whatever it is there's all this

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:42,539
you know it it it it's burgeoning right

15
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:44,250
now and there's a field in Barcelona

16
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,659
that you used to have in Amsterdam now

17
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,189
having been to Amsterdam for a long time

18
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,859
but I did live there for a couple years

19
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,869
20 years ago and it was a magical place

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,488
and I think Amsterdam had like 400

21
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:55,948
coffee shops and now they have maybe

22
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:58,198
maybe only 200 because what happened was

23
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:00,058
in Holland specifically the Christian

24
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,729
conservatives which is the actual name

25
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,890
of the party that came in power they

26
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,469
which sounds really dread in a lot of

27
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,090
ways but not a bad now that's a play

28
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:10,408
them down but the thing that they do is

29
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,868
they try cutting off the tail and so the

30
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,760
head right is what from my understanding

31
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:16,560
they were trying to okay all the local

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,329
growth so to end to help people

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,890
understand we should back up actually

34
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,420
just got back from Canada and Prague

35
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,299
which you know we started talking about

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,728
Barcelona which spannabis I would say is

37
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,470
the top you know spannabis and you have

38
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:30,179
Mary Jane you have cannafest but I

39
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:31,920
stopped by an Amsterdam I know you spent

40
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,320
some time there working with the High

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,210
Times crew it spent some time in Berlin

42
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,250
before going to Prague but Amsterdam

43
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:39,809
yeah with about half the coffee shops

44
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,790
shutting down in the last three years I

45
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,829
mean it really is a different I still

46
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,990
love it I mean I have to say I still for

47
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:47,789
sure mr. dam Holland is a phenomenal

48
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:49,408
that all of the Netherlands I am a huge

49
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,880
fan of me too but you're right it's just

50
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,130
not like it's kind of lost some of the

51
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,099
magic yeah it's lost its lost a little

52
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:58,739
shine and and and what's really

53
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,839
unfortunate is that it hasn't it really

54
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:02,609
hasn't because it's being everyone it's

55
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,469
such a misconception that pots legal in

56
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:06,239
Holland right yeah it's not there's a

57
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:08,159
five grand possession law I think that

58
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,618
jacket right but growing's not legal

59
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,719
selling its only quasi legal yeah yes

60
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,330
across the the threshold of the so

61
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,159
coffee

62
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,870
so it's kind of like America we we saw

63
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,579
all these states started legalizing but

64
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,469
our feds never did and then Canada just

65
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,580
just crushed us fit with the federal

66
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:23,139
with the Pope with the pub coast

67
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,120
federally right well that's what's

68
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:26,769
happened to Amsterdam is it Holland in

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,780
general is they they've never really

70
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,090
know the weed thing has just been it's

71
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,060
hard to explain how that culturally like

72
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,890
like happens in Holland where where pot

73
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,539
use is actually lower in Holland than a

74
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:40,000
lot of other places where it's where

75
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:41,409
it's illegal yeah um you know you it's

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,610
still stigmatized you can't like in the

77
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:44,530
west coast now you go to a work party

78
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,850
you have beer you smoke a joint you're

79
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,020
at a work party you certain smoke a

80
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,009
joint at a work party you Holland you

81
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,230
still can't do that it's still

82
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:53,829
stigmatized right which is which is

83
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:56,259
which is ironic yeah and so all these

84
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,410
other places like so for example Berlin

85
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:01,840
right in Berlin you can go and you can

86
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:03,579
smoke a joint right at the outside cafe

87
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,530
and nobody's gonna say nothing I've

88
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,230
actually smoke joints inside posh

89
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,969
restaurants in Berlin like you ask it's

90
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:12,009
like it's like 10:00 at night there

91
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:13,240
might be only 30 customers there or

92
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:15,039
whatever but it's like a nice restaurant

93
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,320
I won't mention the name I almost want

94
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,859
to but I won't but but I won't

95
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,859
I won't but uh

96
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:27,049
it is Berlin is definitely tiered so it

97
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:30,199
feels more yeah and it feels it feels

98
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,670
more legal in in Berlin that it almost

99
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,500
does actually in Oregon where it's

100
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,030
totally legal because smoking you can't

101
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,830
smoke publicly yeah so there's another

102
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,330
caveat in America you can't smoke

103
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,160
outside and public in Europe they have

104
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,610
such a smoking culture already already

105
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,560
that that's smoking anything outside you

106
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,480
just his aunt is almost allowed right

107
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,129
it's just smoking outside it's what

108
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:51,409
Europeans do with their coffee with

109
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,879
their beer and so on it's tradition so

110
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:55,219
then we have all these areas and so

111
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,139
Germany is now taking over the game

112
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:59,449
because they legalize medical marijuana

113
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:01,609
Spain has got the whole underground

114
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:04,909
thing like Amsterdam even never quite

115
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:07,010
had or comparable you know Switzerland

116
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:09,439
you know Switzerland is selling

117
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:15,019
Switzerland is selling CBD but just at

118
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,560
the bodega at the keys yeah the

119
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,480
pre-rolls

120
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,430
exactly yeah so everything is coming

121
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,400
online right now with Europe it's a

122
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,810
shame that Colin didn't parlay well you

123
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,819
know you know I don't think it's too

124
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,470
late but but in one way it is because

125
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:28,728
there are small markets so they could

126
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,979
peril a whatever they want but they'd

127
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:32,930
have to be really really smart and say

128
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:35,089
okay well we're gonna take these green

129
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,470
houses that were made for tulips and now

130
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:37,339
because they can grow a lot a lot of

131
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,190
shit inside

132
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:46,489
oh that okay when you fly in you're

133
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:50,029
dripping yeah all of these green all

134
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:52,519
these green house not your old school

135
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:55,728
well we know when it comes to dikes and

136
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:58,099
greenhouses the Dutch have got us like

137
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:59,329
like they they live underwater they got

138
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,729
to figure out how to keep out of the sea

139
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:03,228
and they live in a super cold rainy ass

140
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:05,449
climate where they need to learn how to

141
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:07,339
grow shit but they they they import a

142
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:09,319
ton of food to or export a ton of food

143
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:11,389
to Europe so if they switch that up a

144
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,829
little bit and and and and concentrate

145
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:14,478
on cannabis I think they still could be

146
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:16,370
in the game but right now they're not

147
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,379
they're not really in the game like like

148
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,228
Germany or Spain or even Switzerland is

149
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:23,120
now in Prague yeah we have these

150
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:25,909
cultural epicenters that are kind of

151
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,939
coming up in mainland Europe and it's I

152
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,900
think it's not a coincidence that

153
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:31,219
Berlin's kind of become this hotspot

154
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:33,229
epicenter now

155
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,330
moreso electronica and the EDM

156
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,890
where God's at but now it's just become

157
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:39,529
a more of a hip spot like the hipsters

158
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,149
are gravitating towards Berlin and then

159
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:42,589
you look at to your point the cannabis

160
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:44,359
scene there yeah it's only medical now

161
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:45,709
but there's some the HOF and some of the

162
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,840
other guys are actually putting a big

163
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:50,389
effort into moving things further to a

164
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,739
legalization yeah it's a hot spot sit

165
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:54,199
same with Prague I mean Prague

166
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,790
interesting one of in in Europe I think

167
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,709
it's odd they kind of talk about cities

168
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,819
this one didn't get bombed that went it

169
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:00,529
this went it you know they kind of

170
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,329
reference what happened you know world

171
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:04,099
war post-world war cold war

172
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,329
now Prague it's a they're a little more

173
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,310
timid they're a little more because of

174
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:08,419
the Cold War I notice that it's not like

175
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,860
Barcelona and where you walk down the

176
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,449
street and everyone's happy but I mean

177
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,040
said that they very much have a culture

178
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:15,110
in a little bit of an epicenter of their

179
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,879
own there oh so Oh frog really

180
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,500
interesting no Prague's amazing and then

181
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,839
actually I spent a lot of time in

182
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,850
Slovenia and you know so the capital of

183
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,000
Slovenia Ljubljana you could go smoke

184
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,350
weed and a lot of bars in Ljubljana you

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,750
know you go right there and it's just

186
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,939
like Ljubljana is like a baby Prague you

187
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,889
know and so the Balkans are opening up

188
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:36,230
now you go to down to Croatia you have

189
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:38,329
to be you have to be more careful people

190
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,509
are kind of like they kind of definitely

191
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:43,519
have that that Eastern European kind of

192
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:45,560
like this is the Thor this is there's

193
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:49,069
this Authority that will get you whether

194
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,870
it's a real or perceived thing I still

195
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:52,370
sat in Tel Aviv as much as I mean I

196
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,040
quickly tapped into the underground

197
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,420
scene in Tel Aviv and and will admit

198
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,750
that there was consumption going on in

199
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,650
public spaces and at the right cafes but

200
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,350
you're right there's still there's still

201
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:05,060
definitely this 7 million people they

202
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,530
have a medical program there's only 30

203
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,269
thousand people on their medical program

204
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:09,889
yet some of the figures are showing up

205
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:11,750
to 20 percent of the populace consumes

206
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:12,949
I'm like this is something needs to

207
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,170
change here right I'm a political

208
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:17,240
landscape right because it's just like

209
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,699
here where we've got 64 percent of the

210
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,920
population in the US that are pro

211
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:23,300
cannabis and now to some point or

212
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,759
another about 40 percent of the states

213
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,800
of legalize but what does it was it take

214
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,689
to get to that true watershed for us

215
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,889
like Canada like you said they flip

216
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:33,290
Trudeau came in on it

217
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,279
right but Canada was just like alright

218
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,170
come on

219
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,269
I think the UN's credibility on the drug

220
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,139
treaty is just being is being decimated

221
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:41,329
right

222
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:43,519
and I think that that is really the the

223
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:46,459
key to the I think that's really the key

224
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,859
to the to the issue was like or to the

225
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:52,370
to this issue is that we don't think

226
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,598
about this UN treaty as America as folks

227
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,370
from the united states right

228
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,658
people are like oh what about the UN

229
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,310
treaty were like what about it

230
00:07:56,658 --> 00:08:00,079
we don't we oh we got it legalized or

231
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,699
the UN treaty well we don't even know

232
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,680
what that is we don't even care it's not

233
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:05,509
on our radar before you go but you go

234
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,189
over Europe and they're like all we

235
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:09,139
cannot legalize well we have this but

236
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:11,270
there is a you and Geneva treaty that

237
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:12,710
says we cannot and you're like what are

238
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:16,098
you talking about you know just legal I

239
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:17,930
see what happens and basically compare

240
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:19,788
comparable II speaking to some of those

241
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,800
mainland countries were speaking of in

242
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:23,389
Europe it seems like Spain and Portugal

243
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,770
I'm important we I think we're just

244
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,478
talking about it's Portugal fully to

245
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:28,519
court relations that is the shape of

246
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,050
drugs and then goes on top of that we're

247
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,639
launching a medical program for cam it's

248
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,918
like that is such a forward-thinking

249
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,778
compared to the rest of two rights a bit

250
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,838
stuff here a bit more stringent side of

251
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:40,788
the European Union right was a UK exempt

252
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,649
they're in their own people just want

253
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:44,419
control the Authority wants control and

254
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:47,089
so they're gonna have their control no

255
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:48,110
matter what and so if it's not pot it's

256
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:50,089
gonna be something else

257
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,379
so they you know and that's one thing

258
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:53,870
that that's why you have all this quasi

259
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:55,578
legality is because because of the UN

260
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,570
treaties and because of these these

261
00:08:55,578 --> 00:09:01,879
these mores of society or if you will

262
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:04,010
vote you can't you've got to do it like

263
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:05,659
a background like wink-wink style

264
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:09,169
and that's just how Europe has rolled

265
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:12,379
for four years and but that all being

266
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:16,179
said the wave is so strong and the whole

267
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:21,799
UN thing the UN treaty is being is being

268
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:24,278
questioned at least and and it's falling

269
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:26,958
so you add just as we went to 62%

270
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:28,759
legalization after a relatively short

271
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,609
period of time what twenty years ago we

272
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:34,159
or maybe at thirty eight thirty five I

273
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,539
don't know that's maybe and you look at

274
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,539
the stats in the eighties was great well

275
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:40,490
the same thing is happening for Europe

276
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:42,740
so that wave is coming it's it's

277
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:46,039
happening right now in Europe and

278
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:49,730
they're gonna be every country is gonna

279
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:51,528
have their own respective real market so

280
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,000
I think it's only a matter of like you

281
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:55,129
know five years

282
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,129
before the whole thing if europe's just

283
00:09:55,129 --> 00:10:00,980
it stumbled I just did a an article on

284
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:02,750
the legalization it still wrote for six

285
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,129
years moonlighting and everyone smiled

286
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,809
pick up the pen and I just did an

287
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:08,090
article for a hero Gro magazine on the

288
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:09,649
legalization of Canada it's exactly what

289
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,060
I was talking about is you know yeah

290
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:13,159
it's one thing for Canada to be the

291
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:15,379
first g7 country I mean PIRG way was the

292
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:16,699
first was the first country respectfully

293
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:19,070
but that more so being a third-world

294
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,870
country for a place like Canada to

295
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,280
legalize I feel like well what does that

296
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,049
really mean you know what's the big what

297
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:26,269
I'm like well okay we're talking about

298
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:27,740
it from a Canadian domestic scenario

299
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:30,259
they have thirty six point five million

300
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,139
fifty three million less people in that

301
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:34,730
entire country than California right so

302
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:36,230
it is kinda wheelie it's not so much

303
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,509
about the population look at they are

304
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,909
the second largest country in the world

305
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:42,169
only behind Russia but I try to explain

306
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:44,269
to people in in this article

307
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:46,250
it's the export game I said everywhere I

308
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,929
go there's crops on there's Canadian

309
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,340
crops on the ground in South America

310
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:51,469
specifically Colombia is very dominant

311
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,480
in Portugal they have plants in

312
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,830
quarantine in Australia I mean they're

313
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,570
in Europe you've run into a mushroom

314
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,310
everyone quits well everyone's trying to

315
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,560
scale their wheat the growing in

316
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:01,429
southern Europe to sell it to northern

317
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,769
Europe right now

318
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:05,569
so they know if you have a grow in

319
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:07,159
Germany or wherever you know it's like

320
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,220
it's gonna be more expensive than if you

321
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:12,549
have a growing in Greece or matter or

322
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,930
Italy or Spain I mean it's basically

323
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:16,429
inexpensive people don't understand some

324
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:18,409
of the East Slovenia and Eastern urine

325
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:20,539
company Eastern European company is is

326
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:22,279
probably more expensive to live in at

327
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:23,509
least some areas of it than Spain yeah

328
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,939
you know when people understand the

329
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:31,669
whole demographics of the world are

330
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:33,770
changing and so what and so and so like

331
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:35,389
if you like Bosnia if you go growing

332
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:37,579
Bosnia that's no I don't think I don't

333
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:39,949
know Fame was doing that yeah but Bosnia

334
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,540
everything is like Bosnia is got a lower

335
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,870
standard of living and low you know

336
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:47,679
lower higher look like like like like

337
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,600
salary versus standard of living then

338
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,338
then China you know what I mean so we

339
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,350
wouldn't we wouldn't we would thats kind

340
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:56,030
of intuitive to some folk so basically

341
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,339
what I'm saying is how Canada's like

342
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:59,600
goes to goes to Columbia to scale well

343
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:02,390
the Europeans are going to Southern

344
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,139
Europe to scale and and that's great for

345
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:06,990
these like Greece's Greece's

346
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,990
they're getting ready yeah so does Italy

347
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,399
I talked to her yeah but I think it's

348
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,289
great that these guys I mean you think

349
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,078
about it and I just got side two I said

350
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:18,778
you know Georgia the first former Soviet

351
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,519
Union Republic country they started a

352
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:23,458
medical program you mentioned Germany

353
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,740
switch I mean they're just it's it's as

354
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:27,659
pivotal shift where you actually have 45

355
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,980
countries around the world that have

356
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:30,778
either one legalized or two

357
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,480
decriminalized weed so do your point I

358
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:35,220
think the UN and and several of these

359
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,620
groups need to recognize on global scale

360
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,690
you can't continue to chastise and

361
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,060
suppress this plan because at the end of

362
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,320
date it's a miracle plant I thought it

363
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:47,399
was you know kind of cliche to say that

364
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,110
but it's very true but it's it can and

365
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,610
it's a threat on the textile industry

366
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,320
it's a threat on the pharma industry

367
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,360
it's a threat on the recreational

368
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,610
alcohol tobacco industry to a certain

369
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,740
extent it is but what other plant what

370
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,480
other matter out there exists that can

371
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,100
cover off on all those bases you know

372
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,528
it's insane nothing like Jack here used

373
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,790
to say I don't what'd he say he said I'm

374
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:07,110
not know I don't know if hemp will save

375
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:09,120
the planet but it's the only thing that

376
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,519
can yeah that's and that's the thing

377
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,948
about the southern European countries is

378
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,629
that they're they're they're they're

379
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:17,309
gearing up to export all their stuff and

380
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,500
it's not even legal in their own country

381
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:21,239
so you're finding this this like well

382
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,129
we're gonna grow we're gonna export but

383
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,659
yet it's not legal legal here I mean

384
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:27,028
we've we've seen examples like that

385
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:29,069
around around the world otherwise that's

386
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:30,419
you know a hot topic that came out

387
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,820
there's a bit of confusion around the

388
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:34,319
legalization of CBD maybe being dropped

389
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,829
to schedule five of course we learned

390
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,089
from the DEA not from from the FDA that

391
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:41,759
approved that that was only applicable

392
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:43,709
to one specific company GW out of

393
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,569
England that's a perfect example if the

394
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,879
perfect exhibit right GW Pharmaceuticals

395
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,100
the largest exporter of medical cannabis

396
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,708
is located in England where they didn't

397
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,149
until well now as of November 1 the

398
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,708
Parliament just passed it but as of

399
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:57,000
November 1 now have a Medical Group

400
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,819
they'd even have a medical program right

401
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,350
and then you have Dave got g-dub yeah I

402
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,019
gotcha maked not even two months ago

403
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:06,000
Jamaica their first medical crops were

404
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,919
pulled down and sent to Canada to your

405
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,379
point because that Canadians are smart

406
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,059
what's the cost per pound or per kilo

407
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:13,909
right

408
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:16,699
Manufacturing indoor or even a light tap

409
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:18,049
scenario versus outdoor and harnessing

410
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,379
the natural region I want to be

411
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:27,049
surprised if they go to Africa to grow

412
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:29,299
or their I'm sure that South Africa yeah

413
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:32,179
I'm saying nor the Sahara I would even

414
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:33,500
be surprised yeah yeah that's even I

415
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:36,829
think I mentioned before but you know

416
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:39,049
talking to an LP in during grow up in

417
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:41,389
Niagara Falls and they disclose that

418
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:43,699
they have several hundred plants on the

419
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:45,949
ground in Australia in quarantine with

420
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,350
the government for a year it's a 365 day

421
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,180
quarantine on this plant before they're

422
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,790
allowed to drop but that's just saying

423
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:54,319
that before they're allowed to actually

424
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:55,789
utilize them for free so it kind of

425
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,800
pisses me off it kind of pisses me off

426
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:59,779
in one way right it's like you you

427
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,429
motherfuckers want to capitalize on weed

428
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:03,230
but you ain't gonna legalize it for your

429
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:05,059
people is like bumbaclot you know step

430
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,710
up but they can't they can't keep up

431
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:08,629
those veneers for too long just by doing

432
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,250
that alone is actually a step before

433
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:11,720
them to eventually legalize it that's

434
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,429
Australia's an anomaly it's one thing

435
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,230
people I try to explain to people again

436
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:17,659
is is while it is a Commonwealth country

437
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,250
just like Canada so obviously they have

438
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:21,259
the Queen on their paper on their on

439
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,870
their coins yeah but having said that

440
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:25,909
you know they are a little behind they

441
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,549
they are because the fact that there is

442
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:29,629
such an influence from Big Pharma on

443
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:31,779
Parliament and specifically the Prime

444
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:34,189
Minister point to take it's very close

445
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:36,230
yeah you've got you got this Western

446
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,600
influence in the wrong way in the wrong

447
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,210
way but yet they still got some benefits

448
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,790
yeah yeah and the answer to England in

449
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:48,080
some ways yes some ways so I think it is

450
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:54,319
it's it's fascinating man never a dull

451
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:56,360
moment I'll tell you that I mean there's

452
