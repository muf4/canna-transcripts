[Music]

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:15,058
we were talking and you you said oh I

3
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:17,399
you know one of my beds or one of my

4
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:19,019
rooms has 919 cycles on it

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,538
I started trying to kind of crank out

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,890
the math on on what that is and I was

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,368
like well I don't know he's doing this

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,949
of three four years five years that

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,289
you're putting into this medium and we

10
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,840
see that out here outside all the time

11
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,558
but in the indoor environment that's not

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,020
common and they you know come on any

13
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,549
kind of scale it's it's it's even more

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,020
round there's a couple of people you

15
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:46,319
know they're doing this small-scale but

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,020
like what's well what kind of inspired

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,808
you to jump into that I mean it was

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,250
really a number of things getting

19
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:54,808
introduced to permaculture was like

20
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,820
getting introduced to cannabis but for

21
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:58,140
like different reasons the same reasons

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,929
ways cameras helped me I feel like

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,460
permaculture would help the planet so

24
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:04,409
then when we were putting these

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,659
obstacles in front of us with our state

26
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,400
regulations versus trying to you know

27
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,590
bump our heads against them we try to

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,570
work with them the best we can and adapt

29
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,400
you know how we operate how we do things

30
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,289
and Indore was one of the biggest

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,460
challenges we had to face with the

32
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,229
microbial testing they weren't really

33
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:20,759
allowing us to really even entertain

34
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:23,159
outdoor even greenhouse for the most

35
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,840
part so really forced us to put our

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,090
focus on indoors and just being the most

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,340
sustainable regenerative as possible

38
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,920
indoor facility on the planet was kind

39
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,469
of our goal how do I help was it didn't

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,570
do a solo but it was definitely a

41
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,539
journey and we're still learning till

42
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,069
the day yeah so when you kind of when

43
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,140
all this culminate and you actually get

44
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:46,879
in a facility and running it was that

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,379
you more coming from the permaculture

46
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,140
farming gardening background or the

47
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:55,019
indoor cultivation background or neither

48
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,149
so so for me know as I was a medical

49
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,119
marijuana patient I hate to use M word

50
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,180
other than

51
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,260
side of that if that's what they call it

52
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,480
but yeah so I was ahead I was on the

53
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,859
patient program so I was strictly just

54
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,550
growing cannabis oh my god I've grown

55
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:11,080
food as a kid I grew up in a berry the

56
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,010
farming community people like to farm

57
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,690
where I'm from everybody has a little

58
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:14,949
vegetable butter in the backyard so that

59
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:17,770
that's kind of the culture I came from

60
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:19,449
but for the most part I came as a

61
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,010
patient into the industry so my thing

62
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:22,389
was more as a medicine plant medicine

63
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:24,729
and then when I was introduced to

64
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:26,109
permaculture I saw that as again a

65
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,459
medicine for the planet you know it's

66
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,930
kind of thought putting the two together

67
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,540
that's like okay we got this gateway

68
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,860
drug on gateway drug let's make it a

69
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:35,079
gateway drug to sustainability and

70
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,610
permaculture agenda they're farming so

71
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,150
we try to put those two together and

72
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:42,040
really and use cannabis as this you know

73
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,860
this this lead to introduce people to

74
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:47,049
this this save the world method

75
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,730
methodologies you know there's a lot of

76
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,439
research out there I follow I try to

77
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:52,060
follow more lean when some of I think

78
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:55,150
she said in try to adapt as she says to

79
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,330
to endure situations but there's a lot

80
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,670
of things an example as far as I'm sorry

81
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,820
like something Elaine an idea she had

82
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:05,799
that you then like translated

83
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:08,319
we'll just to soil food web in general I

84
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,810
had managed embeds so a lot of the

85
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,069
things that she does outdoors dealing

86
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,879
with the seasons and the seasonal

87
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,989
changes and just a lot of the things

88
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,240
that she's incorporated we could

89
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:22,510
incorporate those indoors just put a

90
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,969
little spin on it you know yeah so

91
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:26,769
that's kind of what I've been tripping

92
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:29,469
off of as we kind of start talking about

93
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:32,320
an actual soil food web and a living

94
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:35,199
soil system indoors is whether it be

95
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,199
pollen ator crops or whatever outdoors

96
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,399
we can bring we can bring things we can

97
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,708
attract things in a way it's a little

98
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,689
bit difficult indoors do you do you

99
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,259
achieve that really by by bringing these

100
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:48,609
things into your garden so it's and we

101
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:50,169
could bring anything into our garden you

102
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,840
know we can we could buy any bug on the

103
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:55,509
planet and bring it to my garden and

104
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,490
that's not really a sustainable model

105
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:58,870
you know the idea is if we do inoculate

106
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,240
our facility whether it be with a

107
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:04,360
microorganism or an orthopod or some

108
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,280
type of predator that that we can keep

109
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,560
it around and sustain it and potentially

110
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,120
even finish its lifecycle so that we

111
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,039
don't have to keep purchasing them so

112
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,920
that's been kind of my goal is is is to

113
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:16,358
not just focus on on what's in nature

114
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,339
but how do i replicate it to where I can

115
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,108
finish not just a plant's life cycle but

116
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,179
all the beneficial microorganisms and

117
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:25,029
organisms life cycles that are also

118
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,889
involved in this process yeah I mean I

119
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:29,259
see that very much in my own garden

120
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,610
spaces I'm I'm gonna purchase something

121
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,129
I don't want it to be kind of a one-time

122
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,569
thing and if it thrives then great and

123
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:37,089
if it doesn't that I need to reassess

124
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:41,019
the situation so you guys kind of just

125
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:44,679
see a similar thing in terms of how how

126
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:46,779
you build these systems and I I guess

127
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,910
you're fortunate on the one hand that

128
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:51,909
that endure for cultivation probably

129
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,610
maybe afford to certain flexibilities

130
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,900
first pest management yes certain

131
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,479
control mechanisms we're able to do

132
00:04:55,899 --> 00:05:00,219
indoors so we run a lot of the same

133
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,579
strategies but again we were able to

134
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,260
catch to track better data indoors

135
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:06,668
because we all have so many variables as

136
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:08,889
the outdoor people do so we've actually

137
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:10,629
covered a lot of ground again just using

138
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,418
the same exact techniques just on the

139
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:14,978
indoor model but yeah my biggest thing

140
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:15,240
right now is again is just not having

141
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:16,649
too

142
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,788
inoculate because again that's not

143
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,469
sustainable if I have to have a bug

144
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:20,879
truck show up every week and drop up

145
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,220
bugs from God knows where they came from

146
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,079
you know so our thing right now is just

147
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,940
to keep things alive I feel like

148
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,620
everybody's real pumped on living soils

149
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,060
and living systems but the truth of

150
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,819
matter is we're all growing in dying

151
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,379
soils and dying systems because we're so

152
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:35,848
focused on the lifecycle or the plant

153
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,639
that we're forgetting that there's

154
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:40,949
organisms in our soil organisms below

155
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,449
our crop our canopy that also have a

156
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,949
life cycle that needs to be finished and

157
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,228
how do we highly keep them and take them

158
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:49,050
into consideration and still maintain a

159
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:50,370
profitable business you know so that's

160
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,250
one thing I've done is just really try

161
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:55,110
to map out a good a good system that

162
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,970
models nature so we can allow all those

163
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,220
things to happen the strong survive and

164
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,659
then they have a place in our system and

165
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:06,270
but everything has a place in system at

166
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:10,649
the end of the day so it was kind of as

167
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:12,598
I've been wrapping my head around this

168
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:15,929
idea and how deep embeds kind of roughly

169
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:17,668
are we talking in moisture systems so we

170
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,829
have our facility right now in proper

171
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:22,198
our flagship facility my buddy Matt

172
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:23,788
Davenport actually back in the day when

173
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,038
did when designing the beds we actually

174
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:28,408
went extra deep we wanted big we were

175
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:30,750
like me and we're this is still so so

176
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:34,439
new like the last soil that the better

177
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:37,079
like the less the less cushion we have

178
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,620
so we basically I think I believe there

179
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:42,779
are 18 or 20-inch beds deep so so there

180
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,610
it's way more soils and I technically

181
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,168
need but again I'm not that good of a

182
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,319
gardener so it allows me to have some

183
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:51,750
flexibility so I don't have to be so so

184
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,120
so on point you know no absolutely and

185
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,649
so so then the reason I asked that

186
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,629
question is now I'm sore anything of all

187
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:02,758
you miss or like way higher and like for

188
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,408
your size of your facility a much higher

189
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,210
amount of medium grant and Kranti you're

190
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:07,889
not switching that media all the time so

191
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:11,879
it's like it's not that it's a big deal

192
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:15,598
on that end but you're LED right and so

193
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,819
how do you feel that have you raised

194
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,728
your room's temperatures to compensate

195
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:22,770
for that yes that's a great question by

196
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:25,588
the way you know people catch that yeah

197
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:28,348
so we run a warmer air temp to back in

198
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:28,800
the day using the hid we typically run

199
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,990
you know

200
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,639
seventy-five our 78 to 80 degrees and

201
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,069
now I get to leave surface temperature

202
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,439
right about where you want to 81 83 kind

203
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:38,848
of range both LEDs they run so much

204
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,319
cooler you have to raise your air

205
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:42,598
temperature to achieve a good leaf

206
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,949
surface temperature so yes we typically

207
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:46,589
run our rooms anywhere from eighty one

208
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:48,210
to eighty three depending on season but

209
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:51,089
yeah that's that's kind of our sweet

210
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:55,769
spot yeah and you know it's it's only an

211
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:57,538
ID it's it's my like only positive I

212
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:59,788
really could throw out there for pot

213
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:00,810
seem like a greenhouse setting it was

214
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:03,779
really when we're talking about more

215
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:07,139
uncontrolled spaces is that allows

216
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:08,698
greater sides in terms of surface area

217
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,110
so we're getting a little bit faster

218
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:14,158
warming up in the media

219
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,870
and so in the indoor setting and LED do

220
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:18,360
you guys feel like your media just kind

221
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,550
of holds a fairly consistent temperature

222
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,288
it doesn't get cold or you know indoors

223
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,509
we haven't seen much change because our

224
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:25,829
beds are off the ground I feel like it's

225
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:27,598
like we're doing a greenhouse project

226
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:29,399
right now well we plan on slamming the

227
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,899
beds on the ground so we're gonna do

228
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:32,399
some radiant floor so radiant bed

229
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:34,679
heating in the beds just to maintain

230
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,360
soil temperature in the winter time but

231
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,129
indoors we haven't seen a problem we

232
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,690
were again we run the same cycle over

233
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:42,629
and over again so they really don't see

234
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,760
much change on the indoors the the

235
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:46,110
radiant heat definitely had changed the

236
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,990
whole dynamic for me as far as growing

237
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,930
in beds to like to put like it's really

238
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,659
exciting and it just seems so much more

239
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:57,419
efficient to actually heat this this

240
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,129
giant sink you know heat sink that can

241
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:04,769
let off that that heat slowly is

242
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:07,980
supposed to but yeah that's that's

243
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:10,559
awesome to hear it is just about making

244
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,180
it work because I know that for like for

245
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,679
some of my people that are trying to go

246
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:15,419
with more regenerative approaches and

247
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,069
endure as they catch a certain flak

248
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,289
sometimes they're like well you're

249
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:21,420
growing indoors it's like but people got

250
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:22,679
work in their confined and so it's it's

251
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:25,708
so interesting to talk to somebody

252
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,269
that's kind of that that's doing

253
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,039
something and like this is how we can

254
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:32,039
meld these worlds and work from there

255
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,958
yeah I could go outdoors I would you

256
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,819
know so I was kind of pushed to the

257
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,929
indoors and you know it's really the end

258
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,190
of the day it's what are your intentions

259
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:39,778
I'm not growing indoors because I think

260
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,800
it caused a better crop I'm not growing

261
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:43,570
no-till cuz I think it has marketable

262
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,599
I'm doing the best I can with what I

263
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:49,030
have so my intentions aren't I would

264
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,490
have grown a lesser quality product the

265
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:53,079
same way and still been just as happy

266
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,379
but just I also happens to turn out that

267
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,470
this process provide creates a superior

268
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:01,090
a superior quality product so that's

269
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:06,160
just more of a byproduct to the whole

270
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:09,940
point of why we do this you know I mean

271
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:11,949
that's also spot-on I really I see that

272
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,090
and it's I think it's a lot more

273
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,480
commonplace for people to wrap their

274
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,700
mind around outdoor being grown in that

275
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:25,120
fashion

276
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:26,530
indoors just it's it's my two separate

277
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,509
worlds coming together in a way that

278
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,459
they like they haven't for me and they

279
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:34,000
are for other people you know I've

280
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:36,490
transitioned from the indoor to organic

281
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,679
living bed through and herb but I didn't

282
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,639
like transition Matt right into an

283
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:46,120
indoor my mind was still on fucking pots

284
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:48,370
and indoors now I'm big fan of beds oh I

285
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,730
do I do like beds indoors I think it's a

286
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:54,399
huge crucial I don't pot as well I'm

287
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:57,960
just too much to manage to micro climb

288
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,959
or micro environments

289
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:05,879
hey buddy I was warned not to pet this

290
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:07,740
cat but he seems like he's friendly yeah

291
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,230
they said they attacked if you touch it

292
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,680
back in 75 see how people pet him I'm

293
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,680
still nervous

294
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:24,028
bring herb Larry Lawrence you got herbes

295
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:27,689
what do you got what do you got you got

296
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:34,578
something you got something some some

297
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:34,579
outdoor mesh what do you what do you got

298
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:46,818
this is you guys yeah yeah this is I can

299
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,818
smell that

300
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:58,698
that's my garlic food and that's some

301
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,699
some seed crop that some friend of our

302
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,560
super lemon kindness to it yeah it's

303
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,360
it's really enjoyable for me like super

304
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,919
not not marketable but unlike all the

305
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,750
marketable stuff I've been like that's

306
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,669
already a few times to talk about that

307
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:23,370
talk about the marketable versus the

308
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:30,139
stuff you like to smoke so how you gonna

309
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:30,139
say where's this mimosa

310
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:51,910
you got so

311
00:12:48,970 --> 00:13:04,330
oh it's far as Oh what I I guess a

312
00:12:51,909 --> 00:13:06,579
little wrong yeah about so I realized

313
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:15,730
this certain hypocrisy that I got going

314
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:18,009
on recently where I like the the strains

315
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:21,490
that I that I grow that I sell the most

316
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:23,409
of I don't really smoke and then I have

317
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,539
these other varieties that I love and I

318
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:27,129
think are wonderful like that but

319
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:30,459
because they have they're less

320
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:33,009
photogenic or whatever their name isn't

321
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,519
hot and I'm the Wright family like they

322
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:38,889
don't they don't have market play and as

323
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,769
such I'm like speaking about how awesome

324
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:43,149
these these strains are and how more

325
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:45,039
people should consume them but I'm not

326
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:46,659
really putting them out to the market

327
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,129
because I got to go through these

328
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:51,819
channels to get distribution and all

329
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:57,909
that stuff and they're saying no that

330
00:13:51,820 --> 00:14:00,460
won't work that'll just sit there what

331
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:02,589
do you see for yourself yeah it's very

332
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,389
similar I mean I remember we first

333
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:07,960
opened up I tried to grow everything

334
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:09,460
that I like and it to be honest it it's

335
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,290
it's it's always changing you know

336
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,150
saying bacon I thought it was gonna be

337
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:15,639
more of a sativa dominant City because

338
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:17,529
it's just the the CEO goes all night you

339
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,419
know so I came out with a bunch of

340
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:22,000
sativas but everybody wanted to get

341
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:23,709
knocked out with oh geez so then so then

342
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,909
we switched up our catalog and started

343
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,620
growing a bunch of heavy indicas and

344
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:27,610
then everybody kind of came around was

345
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,220
tired of falling asleep at eight o'clock

346
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,019
I was asking first además so it's like

347
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,750
you're constantly gonna be behind the

348
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:36,429
ball so that what I found is it's always

349
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,690
have your finger on at least a little

350
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:39,549
bit of the height just just to stay

351
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,540
relevant just get people's attention but

352
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,129
it's also to try to create your own

353
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:43,539
height you know I mean a fights not a

354
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:44,730
fight unless you can create hype and you

355
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:47,009
can sell it

356
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,470
so it's like strange that I like I'll

357
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:51,029
try to pre hype them knowing that you

358
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,129
know the market might not response him

359
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:54,299
well but I'll pre hype it just so they

360
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:55,830
get excited about it for a minute just

361
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:59,779
so I have something to smoke that I want

362
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:02,070
to smoke yeah so you guys so saying that

363
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:03,539
if you got hyping you can sell for at

364
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:08,970
least a minute you know hopefully they

365
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:10,740
catch on sometimes I don't know but I

366
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,210
mean that word it's like it's like

367
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:17,310
anything else so where I was time or

368
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:18,860
something about about hype hype what was

369
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:23,099
the other one wasn't just hype it was

370
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:25,019
hustle hustle so so a hustler is a bad

371
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,779
thing but hustling is good it's all just

372
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:33,960
fucking semantics and so height or

373
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:36,209
personal brand versus reputation it was

374
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:42,180
just when that term people are using

375
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:46,050
personal brand and so I feel that way

376
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:48,569
with with hype is that if something's

377
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:50,219
good then it's good and I'll stand on

378
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,920
its merit but still it needs some kind

379
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,500
of what else do you call high I'm kind

380
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:57,240
of pushing out there so to me it doesn't

381
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,299
mean automatically that it's like some

382
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:06,210
some falsehood some fakeness yeah not

383
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:10,469
necessarily I think I think it more from

384
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:12,389
a from a from a prizefighting standpoint

385
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,810
you know can't sell fight unless you

386
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,809
hypo fight

387
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:25,159
but do you feel like I mean in the

388
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,139
California market basically I need a

389
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:30,289
strip here I talked to they got 20%

390
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:32,960
threshold if it's under 20% THC that's

391
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:35,089
they claim it's not moving needs to be

392
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,740
pennies on the dollar all that yeah

393
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,540
that's the way that the market is being

394
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,039
run right now there because it's so

395
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:42,829
focused on test results

396
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:43,969
you can't touch feel smoke taste so you

397
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,860
has it then look at the test results

398
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,480
that piece of paper and you have to put

399
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,580
all your trust into that piece of paper

400
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,840
that's why focusing on your branding

401
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,940
helps kind of break through that a

402
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,379
little bit but even us in Vegas and you

403
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,630
know we're pretty reputable brand and

404
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:59,330
yeah we try to keep everything above 20%

405
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:01,850
at least total cannabinoids if not THC

406
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,889
it just helps move it just helps me tell

407
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,420
it better on their standpoint you

408
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,129
understand from somebody who knows

409
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,250
nothing that walks in again can't touch

410
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,780
feel smoke they look at the results is

411
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,490
and they don't want to have to sit there

412
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:14,899
and actually work to sell it and they

413
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,380
have to educate somebody that doesn't

414
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:26,480
know something so yeah it's very test

415
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:29,290
results based it still is Tuesday what I

416
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,160
like is originally really did spark

417
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:35,119
education everybody had learned about

418
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,769
terpenes and cannabinoids chemo chemo

419
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,309
VARs and and all these different things

420
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:41,119
and and

421
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:42,649
it sparked a huge huge just knowledge

422
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,179
sharing of everybody just kind of

423
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,630
sharing what they were learning it was

424
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,610
pretty cool but I don't like is that you

425
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,080
know it's gone corporate you know and

426
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:52,669
it's only gonna get worse when things go

427
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,899
federal it's not going to get better

428
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:59,330
Stephanie gonna get worse so it's just

429
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:02,840
it's trying to have an organic company

430
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:05,799
in the corporate industry is can be

431
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:05,799
challenging at times you know

432
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:20,559
what do you think this is beautiful yeah

433
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,850
no this is it checks off the boxes man

434
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,879
it's got definitely got the bag appeal

435
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:25,359
it's got the nose it just just can't

436
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,860
taste it

437
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,079
you can't feel it yet but looking

438
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:32,229
forward to it well I think touching on

439
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:36,279
that point how the distribution and

440
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:38,049
retail model is so broke and that I want

441
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:40,149
to be moving forward in life and when I

442
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:42,639
see like I don't really like my herb

443
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,769
trims before I spoke it but that's what

444
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,720
whatever that's a reality but at least

445
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:48,579
when it was congregated together on the

446
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,950
traditional market or on the medical

447
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:52,599
market that's how we always saw it is

448
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,340
you got your Ethan it was pulled out

449
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:56,679
fresh and it had been hanging out with

450
00:18:54,339 --> 00:19:00,429
its friends now it's all lonely in this

451
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:03,490
little jar and I feel like oxidation all

452
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,840
these things are sped up and I was

453
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,609
looking at some of my product that was

454
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:08,319
dated that it was packaged in September

455
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:10,809
and I was really disappointed and I've

456
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,329
pulled out the same herb when he was

457
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:14,799
over and it would just it was fine it

458
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:16,539
was great and then I looked at this

459
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,369
jarred thing that he had sent me to show

460
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:22,629
me the jar and what was inside I was

461
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:25,059
like oh just not super stuff that's

462
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,500
definitely that's always part of a

463
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,059
problem and I can understand point we

464
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,069
packaged everything before we sell in

465
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:31,659
the eights no less so we do a lot of

466
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:33,369
packaging and it's really crucial that

467
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,290
we make sure that it's at its highest

468
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:36,879
quality when it goes out so we have our

469
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:39,460
packaging room is environmentally

470
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,770
controlled so we're not packaging wet or

471
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:45,220
we're not starting off with cured good

472
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:46,450
flour and then packaging dry dust so so

473
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,829
we definitely control the environment in

474
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:51,160
that aspect I'm just trying to make sure

475
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:53,230
that selling it in smaller sizes as well

476
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,759
makes people burn through it we spread

477
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,740
ourselves out so it's not sitting on the

478
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,480
shelves for too long so we try to have

479
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,430
fast turnover that also helps with that

480
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,200
if you serve somebody up too deep they

481
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,060
have to sit on you know several packs

482
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,350
for six months and then somebody's

483
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:08,019
getting signals laners but sitting in a

484
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:09,339
room at 110 degrees in the desert you

485
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:11,440
then get some freaking complaints Manan

486
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:13,359
sucks we've had them is it again it's

487
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,190
not our fault always but we always try

488
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,750
to just do our best that we can to make

489
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,340
sure that it goes out the best that we

490
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,720
can send it

491
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:20,549
you know we try putting glass

492
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,009
immediately that's a big thing too is I

493
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:25,169
think a lot of people in our situation

494
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:27,480
put in plastic bags and things like that

495
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:33,810
then it just dries out and and it just

496
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:35,880
turns into crap yes you can more than

497
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:38,039
anything in the whole world it's it's

498
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,990
they shut down the licensing system for

499
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:44,789
five years that was the first time they

500
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:47,190
gave him out my wife I know the answer

501
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:49,710
that I would be wrong to fight I mean

502
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,350
there's gotta be over 100 yeah they just

503
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,000
gave out another 66 licenses for the

504
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:55,139
first time in about five there was four

505
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,819
years of the time was last year around

506
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,410
this time they gave him out but there

507
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:00,750
were some issues with it as far as the

508
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:02,640
the judging process was was found to be

509
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,839
corrupt and there were some some weird

510
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,250
stuff going on there so everything's

511
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,990
tight at the court right now so they

512
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,339
have 66 licenses they're just pending

513
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:11,370
until they figure this legal battle out

514
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:14,519
but it's definitely it's a very hard

515
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:15,689
license to acquire you gotta I don't

516
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:17,670
know who you got to know or how much

517
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:19,080
money you got to have I don't know but

518
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,759
it's it's it's not an easy one to get

519
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,769
and say that I know for sure I hear you

520
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:24,629
say that your your package unit so do

521
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:25,920
you have a manufacturing license to do

522
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,170
that or is that just part of your

523
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,910
cultivation rights so in the state of

524
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,620
Nevada they have I think it's like five

525
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,509
million licenses now it's cultivation

526
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:37,169
which allows us to package our own

527
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:38,700
products and then it's a production

528
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,450
which is like making oils and edibles

529
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,180
and things of that nature

530
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:44,130
right testing and then dispensing and

531
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,539
then now they have distribution and we

532
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,130
also have a distribution license which

533
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,299
was really excited about and which I

534
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,680
think a lot of people here's to really

535
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,480
be focusing on except could be that one

536
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,890
connecting factor where a good organic

537
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,910
distribution company like that's how the

538
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,530
alcohol come lose their they have

539
00:21:53,910 --> 00:22:00,029
distribution companies that they sell

540
00:21:55,529 --> 00:22:03,299
all this shit through them sure yeah

541
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:05,490
I mean is tricky because it seems like

542
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:08,639
it really is split up in the back that

543
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,349
we as cultivators can't package unless

544
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,560
we have somehow a manufacturing license

545
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:15,299
we really yeah most of us don't so like

546
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:18,750
do they make it a challenge to get both

547
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:22,589
I haven't delved into it enough to like

548
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:25,159
tell you how hard it would be like I I

549
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:27,048
think it's a lot of 88 compliance

550
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:30,259
stuff which for us in the mountains

551
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:32,720
becomes tricky sometimes like I was I

552
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:34,339
was like like you know an existing

553
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,839
cultivator I was able to work around

554
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:39,069
some of those issues on the cultivation

555
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:41,329
zyv but I'd imagine if I brought in

556
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:43,638
packaging would the co manufacturing

557
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:46,368
like then all of a sudden I would be in

558
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:49,308
a new place they want to see that happen

559
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:50,959
more in cities do you realize that

560
00:22:49,308 --> 00:22:52,638
that's that's a challenge man that's

561
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,069
doesn't really make sense either in any

562
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:59,538
way shape or form I can see how they

563
00:22:55,069 --> 00:23:01,189
could justify their you know end up

564
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:03,109
being a little bit at the mercy like if

565
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,929
we can go and get set

566
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:07,398
separate packaging done but like a lot

567
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:09,528
of times it's done with a destro and

568
00:23:07,398 --> 00:23:11,418
then they're tagging on old sin that's

569
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:13,099
kind of their label with yours on the

570
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:15,350
side and that's just kind of how it

571
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:18,109
becomes as like slippery slope into the

572
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:20,118
whole white label it's definitely

573
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:21,558
causing a problem for branding is a

574
00:23:20,118 --> 00:23:23,648
hundred percent I can see that being an

575
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:23,648
issue

576
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:30,798
that was a big like shift for us to

577
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:34,099
realize like okay we need to do more of

578
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:36,918
our own jarring and marketing even

579
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:38,990
though it costs us it's a we make more

580
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,690
money if we just sell the flour to

581
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:44,079
somebody who's going to put their label

582
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,080
on it

583
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:48,179
but that doesn't that doesn't work out

584
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:50,009
well in the long term now is our thing

585
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:51,750
is early on we had a lot push back

586
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:52,980
everyone to run like more like a

587
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,960
Starbucks model in the bag at first

588
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,279
where nobody knows where the beans come

589
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,259
from you're at Starbucks showed up at

590
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:59,639
Starbucks and that was kind of what they

591
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:02,548
were going for but we get in pushback

592
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,710
like no we really need you just to put

593
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:06,089
it in our glass jar and not just to

594
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,829
preserve the quality of it but just to

595
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:09,659
protect our brand and I want to do my

596
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:11,039
life what's that they wanted to do bags

597
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,480
oh yeah at the time everybody was bags

598
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,240
yeah but no one's even thinking about

599
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,640
doing drugs but yeah that was a big

600
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,470
thing was was hey we really had a fight

601
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,110
to have our own brand and not just be

602
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:25,350
selling beans to Starbucks and they

603
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:26,849
protect us because if people don't if

604
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:28,829
people weren't asking specifically for

605
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:31,139
GOP these days we wouldn't be in shops

606
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:33,240
you know it means so it didn't really

607
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,610
help her help us at that time but it's

608
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:41,519
definitely we're benefiting it from of

609
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:44,369
today for sure really that's really cool

610
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,769
and it's just gonna have this this reach

611
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:55,229
because it has that truth in the way

612
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:56,819
that people know it is buy I got a lot

613
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:59,220
of people that I think do a really good

614
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:01,710
job they all kind of seem to share so

615
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,839
many similarities in the indoor world

616
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:07,169
like I've kind of seen this focus on

617
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:10,019
certain tiles of salt growing and all

618
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:11,880
the models kind of is is the same in

619
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:13,558
these facilities that I visit and sort

620
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,809
of think about like your facility where

621
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:18,928
maybe some of the technical aspects are

622
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:27,509
similar but like that you're bringing

623
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:29,280
more yeah most most outdoor guys only

624
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:30,690
kind of my farm they they they they geek

625
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,759
out way harder than they thought they

626
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,230
would they think maybe they go thinking

627
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:36,269
and be like are they kind of you know

628
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,039
suspects and they going like oh my god

629
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:40,440
this is like this is this is dope this

630
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:42,240
is this is on point with everything you

631
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,169
know III heard but didn't think was

632
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,269
possible

633
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:47,799
life extreme weather like instead of

634
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:52,929
keeping everything perfectly with

635
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:54,788
advance two legs stress attack I don't

636
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:55,980
have to test it because it'll happen

637
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:58,239
eventually

638
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,528
something's gonna break yeah anything I

639
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:01,659
can't have it will happen so yeah

640
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:03,730
example today I just got news that our

641
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:06,820
power shut off and we lost power which

642
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:09,128
is very weird for the position voice is

643
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:11,019
rare yeah it's rare for us because we're

644
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:12,579
located between two power lines so

645
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:14,739
typically one goes out there the one

646
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:15,849
picks up so I still haven't got a call

647
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,470
back but they got fixed I know

648
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:18,488
everything's good but you never know

649
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,629
wasn't happy got be prepared for

650
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:22,028
everything I'd be able again just be

651
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:23,618
able to be flexible be able to adapt and

652
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:27,368
just respond creatively to change you

653
00:26:23,618 --> 00:26:29,769
know so we started five years ago or

654
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:32,678
four and a half years ago five ish with

655
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:33,999
an older light Lumet X they really did

656
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,038
better quality light back then but it

657
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:38,230
was have that blue bold purple pink

658
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:39,519
stuff but it was a good light man we got

659
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,778
really good using it and we had everyone

660
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,239
two rooms a lot warm with that light

661
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:44,349
with the to avoid photo bleaching I was

662
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:46,960
making probably how's that light and

663
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:47,980
running cooler temperatures but we got

664
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,629
really good with it and then just

665
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,159
recently I've been looking for a couple

666
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:53,199
years to replace him took on up datum

667
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,778
because technology and how it is you

668
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,548
know it's next year the LEDs maybe 10

669
00:26:55,778 --> 00:27:00,519
times in this year's are these and so on

670
00:26:57,548 --> 00:27:01,358
and so forth so who knows but I recently

671
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:04,989
found a company that I'm really

672
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:07,449
confident with post they they out build

673
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:11,319
their CFO say I'll build their LEDs that

674
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:13,419
they make the most gnarly fo HSE and

675
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:14,230
they just out build these LEDs like

676
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:15,879
they're just gnarly

677
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,980
they're like the the biggest strongest

678
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:19,748
powerfullest most well-built LED I've

679
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,639
seen on the market they're they

680
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:22,929
overpower them in my situation overpower

681
00:27:21,638 --> 00:27:23,888
me a little bit which is good for me

682
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:25,778
because they don't have to run a full

683
00:27:23,888 --> 00:27:27,928
full bore and I can always turn them up

684
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:31,269
later years if they do start to lose

685
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:33,730
their abilities so yeah we're harnessing

686
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:36,380
LED right now have been from day one

687
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:39,349
what

688
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:44,900
the guy there's a guy I think from like

689
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:47,119
Oregon God like his price per pound dad

690
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,980
like indoors price per pound way down

691
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,709
and he was like speaking at events

692
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:53,110
what do you measure stuff and like what

693
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,509
you're getting your price per pound down

694
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:58,879
yeah I mean but we're always evolving so

695
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:59,869
that there's no real we know for the

696
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,560
most part money I don't want to say it

697
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:02,179
wrong

698
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,980
with my wife list here to answer this

699
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,640
question she's the one that has all the

700
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:09,490
books and all that stuff but yeah I know

701
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,070
it's it's you gotta you gotta have a

702
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:16,279
have a competitive bottom price and in

703
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:18,169
no-till indoors LEDs our facility I

704
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:20,089
guarantee is is efficient as anything on

705
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,670
the planet so I know our costs are

706
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:25,549
extremely low not just on just

707
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:27,200
electricity and but also employment like

708
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:28,849
I'm really efficient with my with my

709
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,769
employees I have two women that run a

710
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:31,819
12,000 square foot grow on the

711
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:34,220
cultivation side they don't tell the

712
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:36,950
trimming but there's two women run three

713
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,289
huge rooms and just being a super

714
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,210
efficient able to execute proper tasks

715
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:43,099
at the proper time and not waste time in

716
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:51,950
the wrong areas is then really key for

717
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:53,569
us to maximize honestly just we've been

718
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,069
in for five years now we're gonna try

719
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:56,419
the same thing every time makes my new

720
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:58,039
adjustments every cycle the for the

721
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,570
better and we just kind of worked out

722
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:01,369
all the kinks just made as efficient as

723
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:02,869
possible that's really how you save

724
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:04,939
money too is if I had I could do the

725
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:07,399
same thing I did five years ago I had

726
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,380
six people running the exact same three

727
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:14,019
grow rooms that I have two women running

728
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,020
now so it's it's it's unbelievable

729
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:22,710
we use air conditioners yeah it's indoor

730
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:25,028
so just traditional their business

731
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:26,110
that's uh definitely something that I

732
00:29:25,028 --> 00:29:27,490
changed a little bit the future that I

733
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:30,519
think there's more efficient ways to

734
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:35,558
cool rooms but you know fact what are

735
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:36,940
you well right now are 2.0 in our

736
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:38,440
greenhouse that's kind of our two point

737
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,370
of it actually our we have a future

738
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:45,788
build out like water-cooled systems

739
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:47,558
what's the one I found came in with even

740
00:29:45,788 --> 00:29:49,960
coming right now but other generator

741
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:52,148
driven systems the natural gas

742
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,069
generating systems are really efficient

743
00:29:52,148 --> 00:29:56,439
and actually kind of a cleaner more

744
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:57,638
greener way to cool a building so we

745
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:04,600
kind of look into those looked into one

746
00:29:57,638 --> 00:30:06,219
of those for a project in Michigan well

747
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:07,509
honestly with LEDs in the amount of

748
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,600
Brewster first place we have I really

749
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:12,579
think with a le I'm sorry our solar

750
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:19,990
panels in future we can take a big dent

751
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:21,908
of our power usage I mean the only thing

752
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:24,878
we don't have a lot of his water I mean

753
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:29,860
so what type what type of greenhouse are

754
00:30:24,878 --> 00:30:31,000
you so the state kind of made us jump

755
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:34,000
through some hoops they made us attach

756
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,859
our greenhouse compound to our existing

757
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,019
indoors so we have to enter our indoor

758
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:39,668
dress out its into it into our

759
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:41,019
greenhouse the corridors yeah it's

760
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:42,639
pretty pretty crazy but at the end of

761
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:44,470
the day it's it's actually I keep our

762
00:30:42,638 --> 00:30:45,819
greenhouse safer and cleaner I guess you

763
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,589
know then people just walking in from

764
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:49,569
the outside so I can't hate too much

765
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:51,278
it's a hoop they may have drunk through

766
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:53,408
that it's ultimately they keep more bugs

767
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:55,690
out I guess but we end up going with the

768
00:30:53,409 --> 00:31:01,419
Agrotech greenhouse we just did for work

769
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:02,860
four days but there's a thing should I

770
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:11,110
say positive pressure Agrotech

771
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:17,528
greenhouse oh yeah yeah I've you've been

772
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:19,508
inside one yes yes right now so we did

773
00:31:17,528 --> 00:31:21,909
three separate Bay's so there's three

774
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:23,649
separate burrows owns and then positive

775
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:25,509
pressure and wanted to keep pests pests

776
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,189
out but also pollen we got a lot of hemp

777
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:29,288
in our area a lot of people don't open

778
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,179
pollination males females not Poland not

779
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:34,179
calling their males so for us it's just

780
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:37,679
one way to reduce the potential of you

781
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:37,679
know cross contamination was hemp pollen

782
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:47,219
[Music]

783
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:56,288
yeah we did it won't be done for we're

784
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:59,019
hopefully we'll be done by summer it

785
00:31:56,288 --> 00:32:01,589
will help me be done by something we

786
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:01,589
already broke ground
