[Music]

2
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:14,369
we ended up coming into an existing

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,179
space that was being used for cut

4
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:20,669
flowers a lot of pests were here when we

5
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:23,129
arrived and ideally you want to get to

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,750
the point where sprays become pretty

7
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,608
much unnecessary and that can be done

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,890
it's a combination of a handful of

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,859
different things first in my mind being

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,308
cleanliness keeping everything you

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,770
keeping your your environment clean it's

12
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:40,769
kind of the first step to that and the

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,829
health of the plants strong healthy

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,550
plants with with high Brix levels don't

15
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:51,049
tend to attract pests nutrition has an

16
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:54,929
effect if there's that there are

17
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:58,378
specific triggers that will send out

18
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,689
signals basically for pests kind of like

19
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:02,939
ringing a dinner bell

20
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:03,978
so you can actually draw them in based

21
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:08,250
on what you're doing

22
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:09,868
if they are here preexisting and and

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,688
trying to get rid of them

24
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:15,329
spraying becomes one of the options that

25
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:18,089
you can consider depending on the level

26
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:21,179
of the outbreak the conditions that

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:26,280
you're working in and the choice of

28
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:30,560
things to spray one of the reasons that

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:35,118
the industry is going to be subject to

30
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,799
such a substrate restrict regulations is

31
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,450
the absence of those regulations has led

32
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:45,720
to the use of a lot of things that are

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:48,060
not safe ornamental and you're seeing a

34
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,188
lot of a lot of people especially this

35
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,859
last year with the some of the lawsuits

36
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:55,589
that have been going around a lot of

37
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:58,379
that surrounding the use of things that

38
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,478
are not registered for this particular

39
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:04,039
use they're not registered to be used on

40
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:08,810
anything that's going to be consumed

41
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:13,879
they are ornamental only the choice of

42
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:15,560
things to spray that are safe for safe

43
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,699
for the considering where the plants

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:23,060
going to be on the plants going to end

45
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:27,399
up being consumed adding flame to that

46
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:29,509
even changes the game once again because

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,400
introducing some of the some of the

48
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:34,639
stuff that is used and considered

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,620
organic fruit for fruit and berry and

50
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:41,689
stuff like that production when you burn

51
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:47,719
it it changes it changes the consistency

52
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:50,599
of it to where it can become harmful to

53
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:55,009
human health I guess would be become

54
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:59,900
toxic so the the choice of things to

55
00:02:55,009 --> 00:03:03,439
spray yeah everything from horticultural

56
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,620
oils to just straight poisons I tend to

57
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:10,849
gravitate towards the horticultural oils

58
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:14,530
they have in addition to whatever kill

59
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:17,810
rate the substance itself might have

60
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,969
there's a smothering effect as well a

61
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,549
lot of things mites and things like that

62
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:24,139
can be easily smothered if you add any

63
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:27,530
sort of put any sort of oil or anything

64
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:32,809
on powdery mildew you'll see it just the

65
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:35,330
powdery mildew falls apart so I tend to

66
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,219
lean towards things that are a little

67
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:42,469
bit more based on horticultural oils

68
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:44,719
than chemicals one example would be lost

69
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:50,509
coast plant therapy we've been using

70
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:54,379
this one for a few months now and it's

71
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:59,048
been working very well it's easy to use

72
00:03:54,379 --> 00:04:01,459
its effective and it's non-toxic it's

73
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:03,379
completely safe to be in contact with it

74
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,780
you don't have to get all dressed up

75
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:10,310
this is peppermint and soybean oil

76
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:13,009
primarily peppermint oil soybean citric

77
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,348
acid the biggest challenge with a lot of

78
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:16,738
these things

79
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:20,769
and how effective their going to be is

80
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:22,870
determined by coverage how efficient

81
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,610
you're able to distribute this across

82
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,629
the plant material or over the plant

83
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:31,479
material things like backpack sprayers

84
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:36,029
can be really inefficient for even

85
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:39,339
coverage in an enclosed space like this

86
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:42,129
ideal in my mind is to be able to use a

87
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:43,899
fog one of the ways that you can do that

88
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:45,879
or one of the ways you can get close to

89
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:48,839
doing that that's still a little bit

90
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,490
more of a kind of hobbyist or Gardner

91
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,859
Gardner level not necessarily a

92
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:58,240
commercial level solution is these

93
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:03,430
atomizers which of course you see all

94
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:06,879
the hydro stores a little bit more

95
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:10,110
effective i feel except for the the

96
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:13,029
spray is all coming out in a direction

97
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,840
these things are spitting out a stream a

98
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:20,739
jet doesn't really doesn't really stay

99
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:24,069
suspended long enough for the air to

100
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,408
kind of move that around and and fog

101
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:27,728
everything out with the with a fogger

102
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:30,879
the idea would be that you're you're

103
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:34,449
kind of gassing everything almost your

104
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:37,658
your coverage ends up being a lot more a

105
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:39,759
lot more even and lighter you can go

106
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:42,069
through a lot less material as well not

107
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,110
have to spray anywhere near as much in

108
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:47,620
order for it to be effective

109
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,259
ideally but I like to be able to wait

110
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,509
till the end of the day and come in and

111
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:54,908
shut everything down and gas the whole

112
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:58,840
house and then come in in the morning

113
00:05:54,908 --> 00:06:01,629
open it up and be using something that

114
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:03,908
that's soft enough that you don't

115
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:05,408
necessarily have an issue with people

116
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:10,060
walking right back into the greenhouse

117
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:14,968
and horticultural oils are kind of a

118
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,968
nice soft choice for that

119
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:22,939
so yeah this is basically just shooting

120
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,939
out in one direction

121
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,139
the authority getting dark underneath it

122
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:29,459
you know that's all dropping to the

123
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:35,009
ground right here

124
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:37,049
oh yeah right there yeah so you have

125
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:38,579
that spot directly underneath through

126
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,139
your spring with the majority of the

127
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:41,819
material it just kind of fell to the

128
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,779
ground and you can see while I'm doing

129
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:48,389
that it comes out just a little bit

130
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,429
finer than a backpack sprayer but

131
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:52,979
underneath for your spring you're seeing

132
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,900
this whole wet spot right so all that

133
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,939
material is getting shot out but then

134
00:06:54,899 --> 00:07:01,379
the majority of it is kind of coming to

135
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:04,350
the ground really fast ideal would be to

136
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,519
have all of that stuff stay suspended to

137
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,370
where the circulation the air

138
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,560
circulation can push that around and we

139
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,689
end up with coverage in spots that you

140
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,639
wouldn't be able to hit directly so

141
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:16,259
instead of coming in and you know trying

142
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,219
to get up underneath the plant and spray

143
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,629
the underside of every leaf which is for

144
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,810
your coverage for efficiency and the

145
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:29,100
product you use and is as a factory

146
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:32,639
a lot more efficient or the the coverage

147
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,050
is kind of efficient together so to be

148
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,590
able to take that and put it in a little

149
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:40,079
bit finer particle to where our air

150
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:41,729
circulation would push that stuff around

151
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,418
in here and stay suspended in the air

152
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,100
for a while

153
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:46,049
means that you would have a lot more

154
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,210
thorough coverage what I was gonna ask

155
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,740
does that imply that a fogger creates

156
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:54,299
finer particles than an atomizer can

157
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,079
it's that's my understanding of them now

158
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:01,110
is that a fogger is producing a finer

159
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:04,680
particle the table in the stay suspended

160
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:08,160
longer got it so who is fogger do we

161
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,759
want to try out DRAM is the one that

162
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,680
we've been looking at the most right now

163
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:17,639
they make two products they make a pulse

164
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,800
fog which comes in two versions one of

165
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,810
them lends itself to organics the other

166
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,350
one is a little bit easier to use of

167
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:28,579
