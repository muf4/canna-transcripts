1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:08,240
[Music]

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,839
I have become a little bit more

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,440
politically active and interested and

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,599
have had a chance to talk to State

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:17,039
regulators and other lawmakers so former

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,399
lawmakers uh had come across my path

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,000
they were interested in what labs were

8
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,919
doing saw that this could be a place

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,759
where they might be able to help Uh

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,039
current lawmakers craft laws and

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,720
regulations and understanding local

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,320
state level politics is what they were

13
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,198
an expert at and they were the ones that

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,079
kind of first got me out there and

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,760
saying you need to talk to a state

16
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,840
regulator you need to go talk to the

17
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,960
Department of Consumer Protection in in

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,920
Connecticut their legislature just said

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,960
they need to Define pharmaceutical grade

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,520
medical cannabis and no one knows what

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,079
that would be so definition is certainly

22
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,760
an exceptionally important part of the

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,320
law and it's really an exceptionally

24
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,039
important part of all the conversations

25
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,079
we have and why many arguments really

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,480
happen certainly the same in legal

27
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,679
context so when I hear that someone has

28
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,679
to be tasked with pharmaceutical grade

29
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,159
what does pharmaceutical grade represent

30
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,599
well it really goes towards label

31
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:07,719
integrity and accuracy and how you go

32
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,118
about building up that label so that's

33
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,719
testing and I think a lot of people

34
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,438
think well testing is to see what's

35
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,560
there but really testing is to build an

36
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:16,879
accurate label into understanding all of

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,920
the pieces and content that goes into

38
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,519
that label being a representation of

39
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,759
what the product is and assurance that

40
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:26,158
it's clean and the same quality so my

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,438
first goal was talk to different state

42
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,439
Regulators there were some that were

43
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,319
asking me to explain

44
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:34,279
how testing's done where in the supply

45
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,839
chain it should be done and some of them

46
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,439
were very you know very astute very good

47
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,240
questions very informed already about I

48
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,118
can't set a limit to zero because

49
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:45,000
analytical equipment is so sensitive it

50
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,478
will find something at per per trillion

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,519
level and then it's not zero that showed

52
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:50,478
that they were definitely very

53
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:52,000
interested in understanding the details

54
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,078
they they were learning the types of

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,078
questions to ask so when someone that

56
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,478
has you know Real World experience and

57
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,399
has been doing it in a very unregulated

58
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,798
system we've seen all the different

59
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,920
types of products that everyone's tried

60
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,880
to shove cannabis into we have an

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,680
appreciation for what types of things

62
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,758
The Regulators should look to control

63
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,560
where they can allow things how labels

64
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,079
should be built up and most of the time

65
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,239
it's been questions along the lines of

66
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,599
where do I test what am I testing for

67
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,239
what should be required on the label um

68
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:22,399
how often should you test how is

69
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,360
sampling accurate how is this testing

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,120
accurate and how do I protect public

71
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,440
health and safety it's a consumer

72
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,360
protection standpoint another good

73
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,719
example was in the state of Illinois I

74
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,640
had friends that were there that were

75
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,840
interested in working with the lab said

76
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:38,598
I can get into the regulators and talk

77
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,598
to the the Department of Agriculture is

78
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:42,359
where that one was at um and they

79
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:43,959
they've created a bureau of medicinal

80
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,400
plants I couldn't have been more excited

81
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,519
to hear that I thought that was very

82
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,039
forward looking beautiful type of

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,599
approach they were very interesting as a

84
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,400
group they lined eight different people

85
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,039
up in the room and said can you talk to

86
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,560
us for about an hour hour and a half and

87
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,000
just tell us you know what you know give

88
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,318
me a presentation about cannabis from a

89
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,959
scientific perspective perspective we're

90
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,238
interested in testing and we just have a

91
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,319
lot of questions at the end of that they

92
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,878
were like thankfully you were here we

93
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,719
had gone to Colorado and thought the

94
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:11,439
whole world was THC we thought that's

95
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,158
all that there is in this plant you've

96
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,919
really opened our eyes and understanding

97
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:16,318
of there's a lot of other compounds of

98
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,679
Interest there's a lot of other non-

99
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,439
psychoactive uses of this plant if we

100
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,120
were to regulate this in the wrong way

101
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,079
we won't allow it to reach all of its

102
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,439
full medicinal potential and that

103
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,599
understanding and education was very

104
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,438
beneficial in how we can craft our

105
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,560
regulations where a Testing Lab should

106
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:33,199
sit what its function should be and

107
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,318
throughout their process of developing

108
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,560
the regulations lots of emails and other

109
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:38,839
calls were back um and we do that as a

110
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,438
free service I mean it's just a

111
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,039
community service that has to go out

112
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:44,799
there to give the right information to

113
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:46,280
the right people so typically it's been

114
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,280
either there's an event where The

115
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,680
Regulators ask people to show up they'll

116
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,280
ask for labs to come around the State of

117
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,599
Washington's Liquor Control Board did

118
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,840
that while they were crafting the rules

119
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,959
let's get anyone who's a lab and tell me

120
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,759
if there's someone that we're missing

121
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,239
who should be here around the table to

122
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:02,878
talk about how do we establish limits

123
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,799
what types of quantities are required

124
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,719
for testing and how do we go about

125
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,799
setting these regulations up the right

126
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,680
way what you quickly learned though is

127
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,599
regulations can only be written if the

128
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,480
law was written in the right fashion and

129
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,238
there's always a little bit of a rub of

130
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,918
what is in the law cannot be changed

131
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,560
very easily it's very difficult and

132
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,918
timec consuming to change that

133
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,800
regulations are a little bit more

134
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,639
fluidic and and dynamic and you can

135
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,199
change those on a quicker basis it's a

136
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,680
little easier to go back and change some

137
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,840
of those things lawmakers need to set up

138
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,560
a really good Broad based framework and

139
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,959
then Regulators can tighten that up and

140
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,879
control that and make sure it's going in

141
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,359
the direction everybody wants in the

142
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,000
best interest of society with the best

143
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,240
interest of the consumer protection in

144
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,800
mind lawmakers that say well wait a

145
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,879
minute I'm going to try and write half

146
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,038
of the regulations into the laws if they

147
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,959
miss something or get it wrong you end

148
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,159
up with this horrifying scenario that's

149
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:53,839
like why did you make it in this fashion

150
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,479
now I can't change that until I get

151
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,359
another legislative session someone's

152
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:58,918
got to approve it it can go through all

153
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,560
these committees until it has to get

154
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,240
there this part should not be included

155
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,160
inside of the actual law it should say

156
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,960
regulator go do something like this and

157
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,560
the regulator can Define exactly what

158
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,918
that should be so it's interesting to

159
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,639
see different states take different

160
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,240
approaches different lawmakers have

161
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,759
different interests in terms of how much

162
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,478
control they might want to exert over

163
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:20,840
the regulator um and it's a very complex

164
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:22,918
picture and it's different in each and

165
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:24,560
every state what we're benefiting from

166
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,159
now is that we've see all these

167
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,759
different states look at each other

168
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,039
figure out which ones have learned which

169
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,720
lessons and as new ones come on online

170
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,560
you can see them kind of formalizing

171
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,039
sophisticating themselves and benefiting

172
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,000
from the experience of others they're

173
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:39,519
they're also understanding hey I can go

174
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
talk to these people there are a lot of

175
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,959
people in the community willing to try

176
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,639
and get these things done right people

177
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,239
like ourselves have been screaming for

178
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,639
regulations tell us exactly what to do

179
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,319
have us help you tell us what should be

180
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,560
done and we'll just go do that so that

181
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,120
your shorts being done the right way we

182
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,439
know exactly where the rules are and

183
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,759
where the lanes are and we can stay

184
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,360
inside of those too to do that though is

185
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,720
really a a whole community effort we

186
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,479
have to help them understand the

187
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,319
principles they need to know they have

188
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:06,959
to ask the right questions from that and

189
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,560
then they can craft regulations and be

190
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,478
willing to know they might need to

191
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,319
change those over time and we are seeing

192
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,439
Colorado and Washington and other states

193
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,439
change them currently California is

194
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:19,240
talking about changing laws so that they

195
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,839
can appoint a regulatory body um and

196
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,560
then have The Regulators actually go out

197
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,159
and write the right rules so that

198
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,759
everyone can follow them the right way

199
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,280
the new law laws being proposed in

200
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,879
California are definitely in a positive

201
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,318
direction they probably are a little

202
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,120
overreaching and that they shouldn't

203
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,720
have all of that in the law some of that

204
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,519
should be left to the regulator it might

205
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,560
make it very difficult to change later

206
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,198
down the road I mean let's look at past

207
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,759
history right it's taken about 19 years

208
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,400
to get here since they said they were

209
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,080
supposed to do these types of things um

210
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,519
what happens when it's wrong or we found

211
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,758
a flaw inside of that in the law how

212
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,680
long will it take us to get the

213
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,240
legislative body to change that it'd be

214
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,680
better if they took a little bit of a

215
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,519
step back and said let's make

216
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,240
regulations along these lines um then

217
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,959
the regulator can change in a much more

218
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,038
fluidic fashion as opposed to lawmakers

219
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,918
saying I make all the all the grand

220
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,000
rules of the land it's a little bit of a

221
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,918
an ego thing in my opinion it's kind of

222
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,720
entertaining to watch so it seems like

223
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:12,758
the laws are sort of like the broad

224
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,160
picture and the regulations are sort of

225
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,120
the the fine tuning and nuts and bolts

226
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,520
of the interpretation exactly you could

227
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,800
say like the laws are we're going to

228
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:21,240
play a soccer game and then The

229
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,840
Regulators are here's all the rules

230
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,598
here's the timing here's the size of the

231
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,758
field here's the number of players that

232
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:27,759
you've got um and here's the you know

233
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,080
all the things we're not going to allow

234
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,199
you use your hands unless you're this

235
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,878
one guy that would be what the regulator

236
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,639
does and then they're like well we need

237
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,879
10 people out there plus one guy with

238
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,840
hands and because of the Field's so big

239
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,319
so um but if the lawmaker said we're

240
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:42,359
going to play soccer with five people

241
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,360
per side and the field is going to be

242
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,720
you know this large it wouldn't work

243
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,439
that well and it would take a while to

244
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,440
go back and change

245
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,980
[Music]
