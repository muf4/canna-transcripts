2
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:12,480
breaking news and the LA cannabis scene

3
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:14,548
today tell us about it okay well the

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,329
city of LA has had a long and sordid

5
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:22,170
past trying to regulate cannabis measure

6
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:23,669
M passed in March of 2017 and there have

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,140
been a lot of businesses that have been

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,900
trying to figure out how they're going

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,949
to get their business licenses we've got

10
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:33,629
a set of the prop D businesses that are

11
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,750
still working their way through the

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,070
application process they haven't even

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,679
submitted their annual license

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,808
application so there's a bit of a

15
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,269
backlog we've got the phase two

16
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:47,039
operators who are the growers and

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,670
manufacturers and distributors so the

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,550
supply side of the cannabis market in LA

19
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,980
that have applied and are still waiting

20
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:57,869
to be processed and then everybody's

21
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,988
sort of on pins and needles about when

22
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:03,179
the new retailers can apply so this

23
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:05,308
morning the special rules committee

24
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,019
heard a number of recommendations that

25
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:10,500
were put forward by the department of

26
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:13,739
cannabis regulations and the breaking

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,530
news really deals with new cannabis

28
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:19,379
operators retailers delivery services as

29
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,469
well as some very interesting details

30
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:32,789
that will impact Phase two so the supply

31
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:34,950
side well okay so in LA we don't have

32
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,079
any sort of like hard caps it's not a

33
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,350
hundred dispensaries or a hundred

34
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:43,618
growers they're only a hundred a hundred

35
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:45,089
thousand square feet of canopy what we

36
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,149
have in LA is something that's called

37
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,680
undue concentration which requires

38
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,810
what's called a public convenience and

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,590
necessity process so what all that

40
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,180
basically means is in LA we have City

41
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,070
Council members that want to be able to

42
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,469
have some kind of say in who gets

43
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:05,218
licenses especially on the supply side

44
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:09,049
but also for retailers and so as part of

45
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:11,639
sort of the mess or goop that goes into

46
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,760
passing a local ordinance or any sort of

47
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,579
law different regulators

48
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,259
city council members and their staff

49
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,780
give direction on what they want those

50
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:22,938
rules to look like and they make the

51
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,009
sausage in certain ways and one of the

52
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:28,039
big ways that the sausage was made was

53
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:29,810
there was in particular one City Council

54
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:32,060
member a woman named councilmember Nury

55
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,098
Martinez who has a lot of growers and

56
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,568
other supply side operators in her

57
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:37,969
district and by the way there are 15

58
00:02:35,568 --> 00:02:40,219
city council districts in LA and so she

59
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:40,878
said to her Wesson the council president

60
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:42,348
yep

61
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,818
I'm down with passing this cannabis

62
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:45,949
ordinance but I want to make sure that

63
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:47,539
we have some control right on the number

64
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:50,238
of operators that get licensed in my

65
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:54,138
district particularly again supply side

66
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,900
growers and retailers of course and so

67
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:59,389
what was put in was there are different

68
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,620
community plan areas in the city of La

69
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:03,500
so the city of La is like absolutely

70
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,230
enormous I mean it's like it's crazy how

71
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,509
big la is its sprawling sprawling

72
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:10,789
sprawling and so you know you've got

73
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:12,679
these 15 city council districts all

74
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:14,750
these different community plan areas

75
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,840
within each council district and based

76
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:20,568
on the population numbers they the city

77
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,878
will issue or go up to kind of a soft

78
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:26,598
cap on how many licenses per population

79
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:28,989
so all that's to say that for growers

80
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:31,548
who are in this phase to supply-side

81
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:34,669
grandfather the folks who supplied these

82
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:38,359
prop D dispensaries what what they're up

83
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:40,519
against or what they might be up against

84
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:45,290
in me alone no longer be up against are

85
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:48,289
these soft caps so people applied under

86
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:51,650
this phase to process hey we we grew for

87
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:54,769
these prop D shops and they submitted to

88
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,120
the city they got their temporary some

89
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,980
of them are operational or not

90
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,919
operational but what they've been up

91
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:03,408
against is this fear that man I'll go

92
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,030
through this this process I'll get an

93
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:06,439
inspection by building and safety I'll

94
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,209
put all this money into my tenant

95
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:09,590
improvements I'm committed to going

96
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:11,840
through the process in the City of LA

97
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,459
but I'm then gonna get to this public

98
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,799
convenience necessity undue

99
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,139
concentration potentially like basically

100
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,668
a wall that's what they're afraid of I'm

101
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:22,728
gonna put all this money into my place

102
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:24,029
and you know kind of really invest in

103
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:26,370
the process in the city of El

104
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:29,039
but then they're gonna be too many

105
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:32,160
basically too much canopy square footage

106
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,920
in my particular community plan area and

107
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,620
it looks like they may not be subject to

108
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,930
these PC end caps anymore and for we

109
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,550
like myself and a lot of other folks who

110
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,310
have been working very hard in LA

111
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,790
especially for the supply side folks

112
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,280
who've been operating in LA for years

113
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,200
and years not not in the dispensaries

114
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,479
not kind of out there to you know kind

115
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,329
of public facing this is a really big

116
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,129
deal so I you know we're crossing our

117
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:01,769
fingers we've kind of done a lot of

118
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:04,379
advocacy to get up to this point and we

119
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:06,120
have a lot of support within the city

120
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,779
within the department of cannabis

121
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,280
regulation I think you know for for it's

122
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:13,168
really great to see that the Department

123
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,750
of cannabis regulation is supportive of

124
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:17,609
the industry and of these phase two

125
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,050
operators and understands that you know

126
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,669
they're trying people have really

127
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,189
invested in this process and want to get

128
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:24,389
license so I'm really thrilled about

129
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:27,120
this it's great

130
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:31,050
almost news hopefully we'll see what

131
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,509
happens on Friday specifically talking

132
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:37,110
cultivation is that the part of the

133
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:38,639
regulation or the the license category

134
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,810
that you're focused on right now and

135
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,949
you're saying that they're currently

136
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,990
only four so you've got different phases

137
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:49,889
of Licensing right you've got phase one

138
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,960
prop D shops they could apply as a micro

139
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:54,810
business so fully vertically integrated

140
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,609
or four licenses distribution

141
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,310
manufacturing cultivation and retail

142
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,500
right so they could do one two three or

143
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,329
four of those counts or a micro business

144
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,500
yeah and those are the properties and

145
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:07,740
they're about a hundred and ninety of

146
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,689
those businesses that are in the

147
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,460
licensing process because just think

148
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:14,069
about this like you know the City of LA

149
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:16,439
enormous City trying to regulate

150
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:17,849
cannabis for the first time ever also

151
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,579
trying to implement a social equity

152
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:22,979
program also the Department of cannabis

153
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:25,079
regulation by the way is its own

154
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:27,089
Department it's the smallest department

155
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,279
in the city of LA what's kind of crazy

156
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:31,019
is when the city came up with the

157
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,089
cannabis policy instead of putting the

158
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,209
Department of cannabis regulation within

159
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:37,728
another larger department that are

160
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:39,709
human resources and other kind of staff

161
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:41,629
and support they created a whole new

162
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:43,310
department so this is a department

163
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:45,348
that's like a baby department that's

164
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,788
trying to regulate cannabis deal with

165
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:48,379
the social equity program and then have

166
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:50,329
all the other bells and whistles of any

167
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:53,629
other department in the city they have a

168
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:56,060
huge task really ahead of them we've got

169
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:58,490
a lot more work to do right so you've

170
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,079
got phase one properties that are in

171
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,879
that system they're in the queue they're

172
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,788
working their way through the queue then

173
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,219
second the city said we want to license

174
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:10,219
the people who made the products that

175
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,380
were put on the shelves of these prop D

176
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,720
shops right so the folks who are

177
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:17,000
eligible for this phase two were people

178
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,250
who were growers manufacturers or

179
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,288
distributors that have been operating in

180
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,110
the city of La since before like

181
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:26,689
basically since before January first the

182
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:30,680
phase two operators are growers indoor

183
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:31,969
growers type six manufacturers they

184
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,590
could also apply as a type seven

185
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,000
manufacturers people who are making

186
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:38,478
different sorts of edible products

187
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,689
people who are distributors yeah well

188
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:44,538
like black star so Bryant Mitchell he's

189
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:46,339
someone who's very well known and speaks

190
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:48,110
kind of at a lot of different events

191
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:52,279
he's someone like he's a Phase two

192
00:07:48,110 --> 00:08:01,069
operator and and so they're they're half

193
00:07:52,279 --> 00:08:02,839
so Phase two we think you know I don't

194
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:04,718
remember how many people applied under

195
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:07,549
Phase two it could have been as many as

196
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:09,288
six hundred but I'm not sure I'm not

197
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,629
sure how many people applied under Phase

198
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,918
two and and that could be actually less

199
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:15,589
than that because I think some of them

200
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,870
applied for three different licenses and

201
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:20,829
are you focused on I couldn't tell if

202
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,780
for cultivation you would rather have

203
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:27,589
the more the merrier or you'd like to

204
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:30,079
restrict the canopy space within the

205
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:31,939
city of La here's the way I view it so

206
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,129
I've been working with cannabis

207
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:36,950
businesses in the city of La basically

208
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:38,899
since like 2009-2010 I had a lot of

209
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,028
clients who were indoor growers for

210
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:42,950
example in LA who are manufacturers who

211
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:45,439
are distributors they looked at this

212
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,180
whole licensing process and the history

213
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,170
of the way that the city of La treated

214
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:50,049
them

215
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:53,929
other you know any cannabis company

216
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:56,479
looked at the enormity of regulation of

217
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:58,969
taxes and I would say eighty percent of

218
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,829
the folks I used to work with said see

219
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,259
you later I'm not I'm not engaging in

220
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:05,689
this this is crazy even though I qualify

221
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:08,088
some of them would also have been social

222
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:10,550
equity qualified for the social equity

223
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,500
program they just didn't have a lot of

224
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:14,059
trust in the system to be perfectly

225
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,480
honest so are they staying in the

226
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:19,698
traditional market are they I just seen

227
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,440
operation or we're not asking yeah I

228
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:23,419
don't know I mean I don't work with

229
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,579
those folks anymore because I'm a

230
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:28,159
business corporate regulatory attorney

231
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:30,109
so I work with people who are who are

232
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,990
going through a licensing process and

233
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,789
kind of taking that leap of faith on so

234
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,740
the point is a lot of your former

235
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:40,099
clients have stopped staying in touch

236
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,480
with you the logical conclusion is that

237
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,759
they're not going through this process

238
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,589
yeah probably not and maybe and some of

239
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,409
them I've heard from have gone through

240
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:52,070
that process in another jurisdiction but

241
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:54,019
there's just been a lot of the city of

242
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:57,170
LA has been very challenging on a number

243
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:59,600
of levels it's it's night and day

244
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:01,789
working with the city now as a cannabis

245
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,889
attorney and advocate is very different

246
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:07,338
today than it was for many years today

247
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:09,259
the city in large part at the Department

248
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:11,390
of cannabis regulation is wonderful to

249
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:13,490
work with I mean you've got you know a

250
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:15,379
really great Department that you know

251
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:18,589
has a lot more work to do but they are

252
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:20,929
very responsive to the community today's

253
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,970
hearing was a good example of that how

254
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:25,489
they're gonna process the new retail

255
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,930
applicants and social equity applicants

256
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,360
is a good example of how they're really

257
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:32,299
trying to be responsive to people I've

258
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,669
been incredibly grateful at how open

259
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:38,328
they've been and transparent with you

260
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:40,458
know proposed rules kind of running

261
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:42,469
things by the community different parts

262
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:45,379
of the community it's been it's been

263
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:50,060
incredible compared to how it was in the

264
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:52,879
past so the reason that this is a big

265
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:55,518
deal for people who are indoor growers

266
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:59,059
in the City of LA or let's say applied

267
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,990
as a non retail supply side micro

268
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,539
business is

269
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,580
they could have been in a situation or

270
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:06,980
and may still be we'll see what happens

271
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,530
and whether this passes but where they

272
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,970
invest in a process and that sort of

273
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:13,730
like as I mentioned before sort of like

274
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,009
jumping into gosh I hope this works out

275
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:18,340
it's been challenging with the City of

276
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:21,110
LA for a long time a lot of years and

277
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:24,379
we're not prop D's where this just the

278
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:26,419
the suppliers of prop D shops which by

279
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:28,100
the way this phase 2 thing was never

280
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,719
supposed to happen I mean I remember

281
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,360
when you know we went through different

282
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,399
sets of ordinances and there was nothing

283
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,200
for these folks and this was one of

284
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,459
those situations of waking up at 4 in

285
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,009
the morning and putting together a

286
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,200
policy letter and lobbying the different

287
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:45,049
City Council members and it was a

288
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,060
miracle that we got that in in the final

289
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:49,370
ordinance was an opportunity for these

290
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:51,559
phase 2 people but what they were coming

291
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,230
up against was ok you might be able to

292
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:56,089
apply but you might hit the PCN numbers

293
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,100
and it's certainly city council members

294
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,350
where you have very conservative City

295
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,759
Council folks they may say too bad sorry

296
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,920
I know you invested all this money

297
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,689
you've invest in this process you may

298
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,279
even have a state license like a

299
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,930
temporary license and local

300
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,669
authorization from the city and spent

301
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:12,379
five hundred grand on tenant

302
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:14,839
improvements whatever you needed to do

303
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:17,720
gotten the inspection from the DCR and

304
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:20,300
then hit this wall of this cap and and

305
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:24,710
it's too bad so sad you can't get your

306
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:26,899
license what this small sentence in

307
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,810
these recommendations that were adopted

308
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:32,959
today says is that those folks that that

309
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:35,719
cap will not apply to them so it's a

310
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,610
it's an amazingly big deal yeah and I

311
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,860
know and it takes so much kind of like

312
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:43,250
detailed to explain why that's a big

313
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:46,940
deal so just to recap for somebody

314
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:49,820
trying to catch up originally the City

315
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:53,390
of LA was basically saying we're gonna

316
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,400
allow prop D shops to make the

317
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:58,899
transition and maybe social equity

318
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:02,120
applicants but nobody else and then they

319
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:05,809
relaxed those restrictions to insert

320
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,480
phase 2 which is kind of like taking the

321
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:09,979
entire traditional market that operated

322
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,740
in LA

323
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:16,159
giving them some pathway to legalization

324
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:19,519
up until today there was a big fear from

325
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,379
that group of operators that I could

326
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,710
invest a ton of money to try to be

327
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:27,379
compliant and get my annual and get

328
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,900
dinged for I guess concentration issues

329
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:33,230
but then something happened today which

330
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:36,230
was that one clause that gave them hope

331
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:40,250
yes okay and we'll see what happens on

332
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:42,379
Friday but it's very promising okay so

333
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,899
they put the clot that they put the

334
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:47,320
clause up for vote today and then Friday

335
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:52,189
is when they decide is that kind of okay

336
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:54,530
okay so the gist of it is a lot of phase

337
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:57,800
two operators who were very concerned

338
00:13:54,529 --> 00:14:00,500
and fearful now have hope hope yeah okay

339
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:01,929
yeah well that's exciting do you think

340
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,110
that's exciting

341
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:08,329
the City Council of LA huh yeah yeah and

342
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:11,600
what would we like to say to the Herb

343
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,790
Wesson's and other City Council members

344
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,529
what would you like them to keep in mind

345
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:21,909
as they vote that we really should

346
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:26,350
support la businesses and these

347
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:29,209
traditional cottage industry folks who

348
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:31,009
really have invested in the process in

349
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:34,660
the City of LA that this will mean jobs

350
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:38,179
in LA that this will mean you know

351
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:40,459
continued investment in this city and

352
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:45,319
that this is you know this is a

353
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:47,509
wonderful great gift that we hoped for

354
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,520
when we passed the medical marijuana

355
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:52,819
regulation and Safety Act when we passed

356
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:55,039
prop 64 and we said we cared about small

357
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,290
businesses that this really will

358
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,529
effectuate that and it's really

359
00:14:57,289 --> 00:15:02,839
important and these businesses are

360
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:05,000
trying to fight their way onto the

361
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,590
regulated market and it's still not

362
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,279
going to be easy once they're licensed

363
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:13,280
it's just the beginning of a continued

364
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,529
fight but you know at least there is

365
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,009
that pathway at least people aren't sort

366
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:21,679
of just you know kind of throwing money

367
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:23,870
and and and a hope in a prayer at least

368
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,338
they're you know it's

369
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:30,639
it will be hopefully a more seamless

370
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:33,440
transition so that woman in that one

371
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,289
zone who is the one who added that

372
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,710
clause or proposed the addition of that

373
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:41,179
clause yeah so so different City Council

374
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:44,028
members obviously have different kind of

375
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:45,949
views on cannabis there's a council

376
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:47,539
member Nury Martinez who's not I mean

377
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:51,140
everyone knows she's not terribly

378
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:53,329
favorable toward cannabis in her in her

379
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:54,949
area in the city of La there have been a

380
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:59,240
lot of grows there's also been a lot of

381
00:15:54,950 --> 00:16:00,770
illegal shops and so you know on on you

382
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,310
know kind of viewing things from her

383
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:06,199
perspective she wanted to and she wanted

384
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:08,689
other council members to have control a

385
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,610
little more control over who would be

386
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,040
licensed and how many licenses were

387
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,899
issued without putting a hard cap this

388
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,000
is what's called a soft cap so once they

389
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:19,730
reach the cap and this is for retail

390
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,440
manufacturing type 7 and cultivation

391
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,480
then you have to go through this

392
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,520
additional process that's very rigorous

393
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,289
like one would if you were going to get

394
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,458
some sort of like a special special

395
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:31,579
liquor license

396
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:34,909
it's a PCN process and that can be take

397
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,740
a really long time no guarantee goes to

398
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:38,240
the full City Council for a vote if your

399
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,850
city council member supports your

400
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,039
project then you may have a chance but

401
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,930
the amount of time and kind of lobbying

402
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,990
and unknown involved in that is huge

403
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:50,208
whereas without that PCN for those folks

404
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,230
that are already in the queue and kind

405
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,809
of working their way through the process

406
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,769
if they meet the certain benchmarks then

407
00:16:53,809 --> 00:17:00,139
they will probably get licensed whereas

408
00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:02,208
without this provision passing you're

409
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:03,889
looking ahead to this huge unknown

410
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,568
factor well what's gonna happen will I

411
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,699
be able to even get through the PCN

412
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:09,649
where the numbers in my community plan

413
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:16,220
area because none of that's even public

414
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:20,360
yet is so we have the elected officials

415
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:22,400
within the local cannabis community my

416
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:25,308
assumption would be that Prop D

417
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,500
licensees would say we already have our

418
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:29,240
cake we don't need to split it well

419
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,539
actually there are a number of property

420
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:35,539
licensees who have off-site non retail

421
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:36,289
locations so they also would benefit

422
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:39,200
from

423
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:41,889
the passage of this provision as a

424
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,330
generality our property licensee is

425
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:46,220
supportive of this clause are they

426
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:49,819
pushing to get like do they have their

427
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,710
lobbying machine showing up at the

428
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:54,529
meeting and railing against it are they

429
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,539
are they indifferent to it I think

430
00:17:54,529 --> 00:18:00,549
probably if anything for it or

431
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:03,549
indifferent okay mm-hmm so there are no

432
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,549
constituents

433
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:10,279
no the only thing that we need to walk

434
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:12,169
very carefully around are really just

435
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:14,389
the council members themselves and

436
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:17,269
hoping that you know this really does

437
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:22,370
kind of move through that process it

438
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:24,289
likely will but what there's no no

439
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:28,279
opposition within the cannabis community

440
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:29,960
I think there's more of a well if

441
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,879
anyone's even paying attention to that

442
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,200
level of detail

443
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,660
not so many people are unless you're

444
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:40,190
really kind of steeped in the weeds but

445
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:42,380
mostly support I would say I mean I

446
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:44,600
think people realize that you know kind

447
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,410
of fairness sits on the side of people

448
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:51,169
who are you know supply-side folks in LA

449
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:53,420
these are LA business owners with la

450
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,250
jobs trying to bring out like revenue in

451
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:58,490
LA I mean you even have like the fire

452
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:00,170
department chief who is thrilled about

453
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,599
the opportunity to walk through these

454
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:05,269
buildings and make sure that they are

455
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:07,000
safe for for that and they've never been

456
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:10,069
in these buildings forever

457
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,920
totally not totally not you know so that

458
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:14,929
again this is another way that you see

459
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:18,019
certain offices certain departments in

460
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,850
LA seeing the benefit of being able to

461
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:22,970
work with the cannabis community and

462
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:25,699
it's only by regulating these businesses

463
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:28,490
that we have that opportunity and

464
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,950
meanwhile today you know there's also

465
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,750
there were also emotions about shutting

466
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,039
down illegal shops and turning off the

467
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,619
power and kind of how to deal with

468
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:38,990
enforcement and the other big things

469
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:40,579
that happened today were the cities go

470
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,920
out how the city is going to process the

471
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,819
new retail applications and the social

472
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,150
equity program

473
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:51,980
so probably April May there will be the

474
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:55,490
first window for applications for retail

475
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,950
licenses only Tier one tier two social

476
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:59,150
equity applicants need apply there will

477
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,870
be about a hundred that will be

478
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,090
processed

479
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:04,849
it'll be first-come first-served basis

480
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:06,649
there'll be a pre verification window

481
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:08,149
that your individual that you're working

482
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,720
with actually is a social equity

483
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:16,070
qualified applicant then some 30 60 days

484
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:19,130
later you'll submit about ten items that

485
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:21,049
include a lease and radius map and

486
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,060
security plan and you know you have to

487
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:26,029
kind of meet these marks you have to

488
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:29,839
submit it first-come first-serve better

489
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:32,660
be perfect and then you know your

490
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,220
application will be processed then maybe

491
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,380
nine months later there'll be another

492
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:40,370
wave of applications that will be

493
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:43,520
accepted for storefront retail that are

494
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:45,709
more that the reason for the kind of the

495
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,420
time lag is because the social equity

496
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,220
program promises to give business

497
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,310
licensing and compliance assistance to

498
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,049
people who maybe don't have access to

499
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:56,359
that right so the city is trying to

500
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:58,159
balance two interests number one folks

501
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,849
who've been paying rent on property for

502
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,730
a couple years

503
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:03,679
they are social equity eligible they

504
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,210
probably have investors behind them and

505
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,310
they're like my god I mean we have

506
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,079
clients that have been paying rent owned

507
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,609
places for two to three years they're

508
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:12,619
just waiting for this process they want

509
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:14,179
to get it under way and then there's

510
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:16,489
another group of people that are saying

511
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,990
yeah but we don't have where's that

512
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:21,470
business licensing and compliance

513
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:24,200
assistance that you know that we need in

514
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:27,650
order to jump into this you know into

515
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,380
this very competitive and rigorous sort

516
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:32,210
of game and so that's why waiting for

517
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,360
nine months for those folks so all of

518
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:36,380
that came out today to within retail in

519
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,109
the City of LA

520
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:42,040
is there any thought to following the

521
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:44,500
West Hollywood lead or consumption

522
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:47,769
retail would also

523
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,349
you know weekly just for sale buying

524
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:52,089
these yeah right now it's just for sale

525
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:54,250
but that's definitely been top of mind

526
00:21:52,089 --> 00:22:01,139
for council president Herb Wesson and

527
00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:01,140
other folks on the council yeah probably

528
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:07,029
yeah I mean you know ever since ever

529
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:08,470
since he started doing that he remember

530
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:11,200
this was like three or four years ago

531
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:13,000
was it two years ago where he started

532
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,950
doing these community gatherings at

533
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,119
night all over LA and one of the biggest

534
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,799
things that he loved to talk about is

535
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,539
like where are all these people going to

536
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:20,680
use their cannabis we need to make sure

537
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:22,000
they have a place to use their

538
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,640
candidates what's the deal with his

539
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,650
on-site consumption like and he always

540
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,670
got really excited about that and you

541
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:31,570
know I think we're definitely going to

542
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:33,730
have that in LA but again it's a lot for

543
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:36,490
the Department of cannabis regulation to

544
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:39,549
process I mean when I learned that this

545
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:41,109
department like what it means to not be

546
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:43,450
under another department that you

547
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:46,959
actually have to like like they have to

548
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:48,759
like hire HR people who's processing

549
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,890
payroll I mean that that they were not

550
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:52,509
even put within a larger department but

551
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,790
they had to kind of like cobble it all

552
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:56,440
together I mean that's crazy in a city

553
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:58,690
this big when you're processing that

554
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:02,049
many licenses how many licenses did West

555
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:05,529
Hollywood process exactly we're talking

556
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:08,379
about 190 only retail many of those have

557
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:11,170
three to four uses so that's 190 you

558
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,940
know times four or whatever then you've

559
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:16,120
got and I think they said there were

560
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,500
like 600 or 800 prop D licenses if you

561
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:19,239
count like kind of all of the different

562
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,180
components separately then you've got

563
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,130
the phase two that you know some several

564
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:29,080
hundred folks applied I mean this is an

565
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:31,030
enormous number of licenses so given the

566
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:32,859
cards they were dealt which is

567
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:34,869
essentially creating an entire

568
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:38,319
organizational structure from scratch

569
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:41,319
you would give them a good grade based

570
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:43,960
on what they have to deal with in

571
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:46,779
building an entire infrastructure 100%

572
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,539
okay 100 in the news you always see

573
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:51,788
these stories of kind of pointing

574
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:54,509
fingers and frustration within

575
00:23:51,788 --> 00:23:57,940
la specifically well you know I I think

576
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:59,349
there is just generally in the world in

577
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,690
which we live especially in this country

578
00:23:59,349 --> 00:24:03,638
and in this culture this idea that we

579
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,850
want to have it all right now and a lack

580
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:09,219
of appreciation for kind of the

581
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:12,308
contoured nature of the political

582
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:15,548
process and how things take time and are

583
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:17,558
complicated and we instead we want it

584
00:24:15,548 --> 00:24:20,048
right here right now my way or the

585
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:22,569
highway kind of a vibe and that's just I

586
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:24,638
mean that's kind of it's a low vibration

587
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:26,528
and it doesn't really appreciate how

588
00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:28,418
complicated all of this is when you're

589
00:24:26,528 --> 00:24:31,179
talking about regulating an entire

590
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:33,759
cannabis industry trying to benefit

591
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:35,590
people who have already been operating

592
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,778
trying to create a whole new program to

593
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:40,118
benefit people who are harmed by the war

594
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:42,700
on drugs I mean this is a huge amount of

595
00:24:40,118 --> 00:24:45,249
very groundbreaking really incredible

596
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,558
public policy and ideas that you're

597
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:49,899
bringing up sort of from the heavens

598
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:51,428
into reality into all these rules and

599
00:24:49,898 --> 00:24:53,589
regulations and you need to hire people

600
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:56,649
then you need to implement I mean it is

601
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:58,388
it's amazing how much is involved and if

602
00:24:56,648 --> 00:25:00,579
you're outside of the process and you

603
00:24:58,388 --> 00:25:02,308
don't kind of see you know and and

604
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:05,138
really take the time to understand how

605
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:10,108
incredibly how much detail can go into

606
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:12,428
just one paragraph one one one issue

607
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:14,710
it's easy to point and say well why

608
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:17,528
isn't this happening quicker why can't

609
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,419
you guys get your stuff together that

610
00:25:17,528 --> 00:25:20,618
that's always easy to do from the

611
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:22,778
outside when you see it from the inside

612
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:25,148
and the top that has to go into all of

613
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:27,579
this and not to mention a public process

614
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:29,048
and various studies and you know

615
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:31,148
implementation and what kind of

616
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:34,388
technology platform and this is this is

617
00:25:31,148 --> 00:25:40,648
massive what's happening peanut gallery

618
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:44,738
any question comments museums

619
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:46,508
does these new findings out today does

620
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:48,819
it give more hope for more of the

621
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:52,868
process you think to people that want to

622
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:55,349
come in or is this is this really about

623
00:25:52,868 --> 00:25:58,409
a celebration for those that

624
00:25:55,349 --> 00:26:01,349
I've been building and have been here

625
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,360
yeah that's a good question um it's

626
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:07,889
definitely a celebration for those who

627
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:09,990
have been here for new totally new

628
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:12,299
growers totally new manufacturers so

629
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:15,779
basically the phase three I want to come

630
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:17,668
into LA and open up my grow but this is

631
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:20,399
not a win for them it's gonna take the

632
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:22,350
long long time the city has basically

633
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,870
said we're not we're just dealing with

634
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:27,178
new retail licenses who even knows when

635
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:29,339
the supply side in the city of La is

636
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:31,970
going to open up to new applicants which

637
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:34,889
makes the prop DS and the phase two

638
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:53,069
licenses even more valuable which is

639
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:57,419
great yeah I mean what's been really

640
00:26:53,069 --> 00:27:00,839
incredible is how issues around

641
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:04,650
marijuana justice and reform have really

642
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:06,509
kind of swept the country and really you

643
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,250
know this morning there were a lot of

644
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:10,230
folks who gave public comment during

645
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:12,210
this hearing a lot of people talking

646
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,548
about the social equity program the

647
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,710
opportunity that you know individuals

648
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:19,740
who spoke opportunities this gives me

649
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:21,659
this gives my community and that really

650
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,190
is having reverberations across the

651
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:27,240
country and I think that would be one of

652
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:30,058
those sort of like those maybe it's it's

653
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,710
like a domino or some card that you take

654
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:34,139
and then it will all fall I mean it's

655
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:36,120
definitely one of the you know kind of

656
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,490
these fundamental issues that we're all

657
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:40,558
in this country and that certainly years

658
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:43,259
ago I started looking around like what

659
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:45,149
is up with this complete ridiculous

660
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:47,190
contradiction where you've got we're

661
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,440
legalizing cannabis in certain states

662
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,419
certain people are making tons of money

663
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,519
from it and benefiting from it in other

664
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:56,009
states and certain people who have been

665
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,569
most harmed not just still going to

666
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:59,579
prison for it I mean this contradiction

667
00:27:57,569 --> 00:28:00,779
doesn't make any sense so you know I

668
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:02,548
know you kind of asked about like

669
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:05,670
businesses in LA but I would say the

670
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:08,309
social equity program that is of top

671
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:12,140
priority and you know thank goodness and

672
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:14,909
thank goodness it will also continue to

673
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,400
create that change nationwide which I

674
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:19,800
think will help with federal

675
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,170
legalization and hopefully be scheduling

676
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:24,029
stem well Arielle

677
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:26,250
thank you for taking a seat between

678
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:28,629
Hello Kitty and Star Trek Barbie

679
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:41,420
yeah welcome it's my pleasure

680
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:41,420
