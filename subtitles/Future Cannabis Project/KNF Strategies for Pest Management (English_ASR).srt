1
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:08,279
she's been working with Korean natural

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:12,120
farming and we're dealing more and more

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:16,079
with pathogens and pests on our cannabis

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:19,259
and on our vegetation with environmental

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:22,679
stresses that we're all feeling from the

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,740
external world so I'd love for you Wendy

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,948
to talk about some KNF practices that

8
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:33,109
can help us specifically to pass some

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,969
pathogens on our cannabis plants so

10
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:37,738
really the basis of a good pest

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,770
management plan actually starts with

12
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,269
scouting which as I've integrated more

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,890
and more with a lot of cultivators

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,270
across the United States I've realized

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,640
that most people don't actually really

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,800
know how to Scout properly one thing

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,448
that we discovered was that even though

18
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,009
we were scouting our cannabis plants

19
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:55,649
pretty well for the most part we weren't

20
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,179
scouting our companion plants so the

21
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,308
clover that you mentioned while it is

22
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,448
amazing and awesome is also a wonderful

23
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:02,399
banker for thrips

24
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:03,719
and those thrips will move from your

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,790
clover up into the canopy of your

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,618
cannabis so all of a sudden knows like

27
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,909
we have thrips in our cannabis where did

28
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:11,310
these come from and I look down at the

29
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,469
clover and it was like covered so

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,670
learning how to scout properly which

31
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:16,920
means that you're going to different

32
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,960
parts of your garden each time ideally

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,359
daily if you're gonna really you know do

34
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,188
it but at least every week and check

35
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,349
different plants you want to check your

36
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:27,298
top your middle inside and look at

37
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,099
different areas you want to get a really

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,770
good scope that you can actually see

39
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:33,688
things like russet mites because what

40
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,938
happens with our pests is that in

41
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:38,069
general we have outbreaks and at that

42
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:41,849
point it becomes very very hard to

43
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:44,548
manage them so you know preventative is

44
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,349
always best but you know how do you make

45
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,118
sure you manage an infestation before it

46
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:49,679
really gets bad because preventing is

47
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,159
not possible like we're talking about

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,009
nature right nature finds a way so what

49
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,100
we discovered this year is that it's

50
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,299
actually I mean I again I think pretty

51
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,640
much all of us could talk for like an

52
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,030
hour on each of these but so figure out

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,500
how to scout scout well start their

54
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,818
Korean natural farming really builds

55
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,878
theirs I've been talking a lot this

56
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,889
weekend about an 8020 principle so if

57
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,750
you do one thing and you do it well it's

58
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,729
take care of 80% of your problems and

59
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,610
with Korean natural farming what we've

60
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:22,709
found is that the pest pressure is

61
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,600
incredibly mitigated just on the basis

62
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,390
of having a very fungal e dominant soil

63
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,699
so using indigenous microorganisms get

64
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:33,029
your fungal dominance way up there

65
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:34,829
ten to one thirty to one super high

66
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,090
levels if you can and keep building it

67
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,280
throughout the years then your press

68
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,500
your pest pressure will be reduced more

69
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,810
and more and more that being said we

70
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,039
still do have bugs it's gonna happen you

71
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,479
know you're gonna get a bad cut from

72
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,310
somebody somebody's gonna come over to

73
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,509
visit your farm from their farm and you

74
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,409
know they're gonna look at a plant and

75
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:54,539
bam you've got something so what we did

76
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:56,430
was we reached out to a wide variety of

77
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:58,979
people we had some hemp farmers in

78
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,680
Colorado I had some farmers up in

79
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:04,469
Washington and Oregon and myself and we

80
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,670
all started trialing out jedem solutions

81
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:10,979
which is basically the son of KNF and

82
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:13,349
found extremely high success rates

83
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:15,659
somewhat I was talking to yesterday uses

84
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,579
the same regiment that we did and also

85
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:20,969
said it was highly successful in like

86
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,219
pretty much eradicating Russert mites if

87
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:25,530
it's on our farm the only place that we

88
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:27,509
had them really bad was the one little

89
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,390
area that we weren't doing anything on

90
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:31,919
which is a new field so already our you

91
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:34,169
know bacterial the dominance is too high

92
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,500
we had huge pest pressures over there

93
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:39,629
but we used genomicists Ellucian which

94
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,299
you can make yourself cost pennies per

95
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:43,949
gallon it's extremely cheap it's very

96
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,400
effective because the way that it

97
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:49,379
creates a wettable sulfur is not using a

98
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,120
liming process which is what these with

99
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:55,469
the industrial industrial wettable

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,560
powders which make your pest can can can

101
00:03:55,469 --> 00:04:00,479
get resistant to the sulfur itself so it

102
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,019
ceases to be effective in long-term

103
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,018
solutions

104
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,960
you use it you can use it any time we

105
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:14,669
use it preventatively once a month we

106
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:18,660
did have an outbreak of what did we have

107
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:20,370
this year yeah we had some aphids but

108
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,820
those don't they're not they're really

109
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,959
not that difficult to deal with if

110
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:26,009
you're in a greenhouse it's different

111
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,680
but if you're in a greenhouse you can

112
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,569
cover it and heat it up really well for

113
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,459
us we had a we have a lot of natural

114
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,899
beneficial predators that come in and

115
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:36,329
kind of take care of the aphids for the

116
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,979
most part with the exception of the one

117
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:40,469
new garden which those plants were just

118
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,879
weak pests go to weak plants they

119
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,360
actually sense it they'll send out

120
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:47,610
signals the more bugs will come in so

121
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,189
the Janome sulfur is great to use

122
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,439
preventatively and it's great to use you

123
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,939
can use it every single day in the

124
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,370
evening an hour before sunset

125
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:57,959
you can if anybody's interested there's

126
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,720
the book it's a genomic it's the orange

127
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,639
one and he takes you through the only

128
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,080
thing I will say with this is that he

129
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,629
doesn't tell you anything about

130
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,810
protective gear so make sure you have a

131
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:10,500
mask respirator glasses the whole nine

132
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,660
yards

133
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,430
Saddam wetting agent is another one it's

134
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,660
a soap I use it for dish soap we use it

135
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,449
for hand soap we use it as our wedding

136
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:22,050
agent for our plants so you if you do

137
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:23,909
the dom sulfur the Jas you do the Janome

138
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,370
wetting agent and then if you

139
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,140
incorporate JHS Joe Dom herbal solution

140
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,168
which you can make out of a variety of

141
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,990
things the Jerusalem artichoke was

142
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:34,728
highly effective the ginkgo is highly

143
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,019
effective

144
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:39,120
apparently oleander is highly effective

145
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:40,469
I'm not gonna go there because oleander

146
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,500
is really poisonous and I don't really

147
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,520
want that on my medicine so and we don't

148
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,379
I don't know there's just something

149
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,799
about I don't want to do but you can try

150
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:51,870
it and then we also kind of went outside

151
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,228
the box and we did a california bay

152
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:59,100
laurel JHS which was really effective as

153
00:05:55,228 --> 00:06:00,899
well and so basically the whole group of

154
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,229
us what we all came back with was that

155
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:06,929
JWA and Jas alone worked really well to

156
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:09,240
mitigate pest pressures adding JHS to

157
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,340
that regimen as well got almost complete

158
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,918
eradication and that was against Russert

159
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:16,500
mites a fits

160
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,128
spider mites oh that's what we had with

161
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,019
spider mites

162
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:25,229
my violas of all things and thrips

163
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:26,549
somebody had in Washington I'm missing

164
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:30,988
something there's another pest that we

165
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:34,228
all get that's tiny broad mites thank

166
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:37,938
