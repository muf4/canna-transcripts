[Music]

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,240
good morning today we're here with my

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,309
friend Omar Figueroa

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,190
Omar is the principal at the Law Offices

5
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:20,160
of Omar Figueroa he has been in the

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,769
cannabis industry for probably the last

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,480
25 or so years he's got a huge amount of

8
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:29,549
fascinating stories to tell so I please

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,009
do hope that everybody that's listening

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,689
to us today looks come up off line

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,070
if I was gonna ask him about his

12
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:37,140
background in the industry we'd go on

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,909
for 40 minutes just than that so I

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,410
really just wanted to jump straight into

15
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:42,988
the topics that we're really interested

16
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:45,689
in today Omar how did you get interested

17
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:48,058
in this appellations project and sort of

18
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:50,609
what brought you to us into this point

19
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,769
here today yes so I'm interested in the

20
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:55,619
Appalachians because I see that as a way

21
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,199
for craft cannabis cultivators to

22
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:01,948
survive by producing ultra-premium

23
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:05,099
products the same as wine Appalachians

24
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:08,489
the same as cheese Appalachians and it's

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:11,609
really a way to honor the specific

26
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:14,579
geographical characteristics of a region

27
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:18,180
so it's also a way to honor the heritage

28
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:20,009
of craft cannabis and so when you're

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,670
talking about that heritage of craft

30
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,200
cannabis what would a system of

31
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,390
Appalachians mean to some of those

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,820
legacy producers that that have been in

33
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,228
this industry for decades that maybe

34
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:33,059
have been on the wrong side of the law

35
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:34,709
at certain points now we're struggling

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,509
to make a living

37
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:39,629
what Appalachians do something for that

38
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,209
legacy culture those legacy communities

39
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,789
up in Northern California yes many I

40
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:48,658
think it would incentivize the more to

41
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:52,040
transition into the license part of the

42
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:55,140
cannabis industry and that is because

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,930
you know the only licensed cultivators

44
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,700
can apply can submit a petition to

45
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,920
establish a new appellation under the

46
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,180
proposed regulations in California and

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,610
so this new world of Appalachians is of

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,800
course going to be limited to regulated

49
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:15,720
cannabis and

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:20,219
the cachet of many cannabis producing

51
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,389
regions is which is worldwide if once

52
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,930
there's an opportunity to put an

53
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:27,539
appellation on it and an identifier some

54
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,080
sort of designation or seal I think

55
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:34,530
that's super exciting for people who you

56
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,469
know used to be persecuted and that's

57
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,319
why they went to the Emerald triangle

58
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,750
which is composed of Mendocino Humboldt

59
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,289
and Trinity counties and now they're

60
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,960
celebrated and so this celebration of

61
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:52,340
their heritage I think will be

62
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,860
incentivize people to come out of the

63
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,069
legacy duty-free market some call it the

64
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,340
black market and go into the regulated

65
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:04,229
cannabis world and you mentioned that

66
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,090
sort of dynamic between the historic

67
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,039
illicit markets and those legacy markets

68
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,379
and the current regulated cannabis

69
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,509
markets could you just explain a little

70
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:14,400
bit more how having an appellation and

71
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:16,699
sort of what that means for consumers

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,810
how that would help those farmers

73
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:21,449
compete more effectively against those

74
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,000
illicit markets definitely by having

75
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:28,519
like officially recognized Appalachians

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,659
which will you know be a shorthand for a

77
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:35,730
particular type of product standards

78
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:38,039
practices or varietal you know and

79
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:40,949
basically a symbol of quality I think

80
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,560
that will give an edge to the struggling

81
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:47,369
farmers in the regulated cannabis world

82
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,800
who have been competing against growers

83
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,450
who don't have to pay taxes don't have

84
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,880
to pay licensing fees don't have to

85
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,189
worry about regulations and don't have

86
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:59,120
to worry about testing their product and

87
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:02,280
they can use every type of pesticide

88
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,000
fungicide and herbicide that they wish

89
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,640
without restriction and so I think you

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,489
know once consumers realize like that

91
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:16,079
cannabis with from an appellation

92
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:19,889
denotes not just geographical origin but

93
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,490
also particular standards practices and

94
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,419
cultivars I think that consumers will

95
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,650
naturally be

96
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:31,980
attracted to products bearing an

97
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:34,289
appellation of origin designation that's

98
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,420
great and you mentioned that it's not

99
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,450
just a geographical indicator that there

100
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:42,420
are other aspects of how a plant is

101
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:44,939
cultivated of what types of different

102
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,920
substances are used on the plant can you

103
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:50,430
give us an idea of sort of the range of

104
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,860
different inputs that we could have in a

105
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,170
set of definitions of appellation so

106
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,250
whether that does apply to you know the

107
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,040
chemicals the pesticides that you're

108
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,980
using how that would define sort of what

109
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,439
those practices are that we want to

110
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:06,750
communicate to ultimate consumers about

111
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,939
how their farmers are are cultivating

112
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,180
their products yes there's a lot of

113
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:15,420
flexibility in the proposed regulations

114
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:18,060
which require the petitioner who is

115
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:21,060
proposing the establishment of a new

116
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:24,110
appellation to identify not simply a

117
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:28,410
geographical area but particular

118
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:30,000
practices or you know and then the

119
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,090
practice this could be like a practice

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,759
like not using pesticides not using

121
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:38,609
herbicides it could also be practices

122
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,129
such as plant by the light of the moon

123
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,340
plant in the new moon harvest in the

124
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:47,670
full moon you know those could be like

125
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:50,429
practices as well as well as standards

126
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:53,370
and standards are interpreted more to

127
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,959
mean something like green clean green

128
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:59,579
certification or biodynamic Demeter

129
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:03,810
certification or other standards that

130
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:06,569
the petitioners of a new appellation can

131
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,240
propose and then finally varietals and

132
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:11,219
so you know that's kind of like

133
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,639
chardonnay or champagne which are

134
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:18,320
particularly for idols of grapes you

135
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,120
know there's the idea of having a

136
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,569
geographical region with a particular a

137
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,360
particular varietal of cannabis you know

138
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:30,769
an example would be like Blue Dream and

139
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,960
say Tom CAI you know Tom CAI region in

140
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:37,049
Mendocino County is near Redwood Valley

141
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,568
and so an example of that would be Tom

142
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,000
CAI blue

143
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:45,550
which would just simply specify a

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,740
varietal another option would be Tom Chi

145
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:51,110
biodynamic Dimitar certified which would

146
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:56,598
be specifying geographical region as

147
00:06:51,110 --> 00:07:02,080
well as a standard or it could be Tom

148
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:04,490
Chi you know hand cultivated and

149
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,469
everything had to be done by hand you

150
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:11,050
know and that would be specifying

151
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:13,669
particular practices and so when you're

152
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,680
applying for an appellation you said

153
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:18,430
that the petitioners would have to apply

154
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,019
to a certain body under the CDA

155
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,879
regulations whose the application made

156
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,948
to is that a County based application a

157
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,069
city based application is that a

158
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:30,348
statewide you to apply in CDFA yes the

159
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:32,750
application is submitted to CDFI and

160
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:36,529
then to help make its decision the CDA

161
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,360
FA can appoint a petition review panel

162
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:39,888
and the petition review panel is

163
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,288
supposed to be composed of people with

164
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:45,740
particular expertise in you know the

165
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:48,110
area of Appalachians one criticism of

166
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,629
the proposed regulations is that there's

167
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,538
no time frame for decision and there's

168
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:57,310
no reconsideration of a decision or

169
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:59,538
appeal from a decision and so you know

170
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,120
technically a petition could be

171
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:03,889
submitted and then it could take 50

172
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,649
years for them to the side on it because

173
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:09,668
there's really nothing that incentivizes

174
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:12,379
prompt review and so what we are

175
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:15,049
proposing as members of the incb a will

176
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:18,589
be procedural protections so that we can

177
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:21,439
have review and so that the process you

178
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:23,239
know is also more predictable to those

179
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,718
who are submitting applications or

180
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,699
petitions sure so you mentioned that as

181
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:30,259
one aspect of sort of controversy within

182
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:32,269
the the set of proposed regulations

183
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,658
coming out of the CDF a are there other

184
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:37,309
aspects of the regulations either

185
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:40,458
procedural aspects like the lack of a

186
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:42,978
timed review in which you can expect to

187
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,899
answer in an X number of days are there

188
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,879
other either procedural issues that you

189
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,740
have with the CDFA regulations or or

190
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,559
perhaps there are substantive issues

191
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,129
where a term or a set of terms hasn't

192
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:54,799
been adequately

193
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:57,289
to find are there other pieces of it was

194
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,240
sort of we see troubles with sure I

195
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:02,719
think we want a longer public notice

196
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:06,110
period so that the public has a greater

197
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,460
opportunity to comment and there they

198
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,100
don't we don't have to be constantly

199
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,889
checking to see if a new petition has

200
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,470
been submitted because it's gonna be

201
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:17,029
long enough comment period that you know

202
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,340
you can check every month you don't have

203
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:20,569
to check every single week because if

204
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:24,440
you don't check every single week you

205
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:26,240
know then things could get yeah somebody

206
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,060
could submit a petition for the

207
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,539
establishment of an appellation that is

208
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:34,479
really wholly objectionable and so I

209
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:38,709
think that's one thing with regard to

210
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:42,409
you know ways to improve the process the

211
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:45,500
incb a appellation subcommittee has

212
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:48,980
identified ways to make this whole

213
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:51,620
process more accessible currently the

214
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,170
way they are proposing to fund the whole

215
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:58,450
cannabis appellations program is with a

216
00:09:54,169 --> 00:10:01,490
one-time fee of approximately $20,000 to

217
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:04,460
file a petition to establish a new

218
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,740
appellation of origin and this $20,000

219
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,320
is supposed to fund the cannabis

220
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,200
appellation program in perpetuity that's

221
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,540
why it's so high so what we're proposing

222
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,900
instead would be a more reasonable

223
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:20,959
filing fee like say half of that $10,000

224
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:23,029
and then every ten years there could be

225
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,910
like a renewal fee and that would

226
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:27,379
accomplish the objective of funding the

227
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:29,719
cannabis appellation program in

228
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:32,360
perpetuity but it would not establish

229
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,600
such high barriers to entry that

230
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,899
struggling farmers who are now competing

231
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,960
with unregulated unregulated unlicensed

232
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:45,799
and untaxed cultivators it would allow

233
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,230
them you know the financial flexibility

234
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,769
to submit an application and so we've

235
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,269
had really constructive discussions with

236
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:55,279
incb a appellation subcommittee and

237
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:57,889
there are many brilliant lawyers who are

238
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,769
really like donating a lot of their

239
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:02,838
expertise and their time and so we have

240
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:05,329
been formulating some pretty um

241
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:05,600
well-thought-out comments that are need

242
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,810
to

243
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,210
on certain policy positions that are

244
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:13,009
controversial and that you know we're

245
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,540
just noticing the policy differences but

246
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:16,490
there's certain procedural

247
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:19,429
recommendations that I think everybody

248
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,889
would agree within you know we're going

249
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:23,629
to be making those recommendations and

250
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:26,210
hopefully the board can consider them

251
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:30,289
and you know perhaps this will be

252
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:32,450
something that's incb a will take you

253
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:36,139
know establishing the first Appalachians

254
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:38,210
for cannabis in history is a momentous

255
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:41,240
occasion and we're lucky that so many

256
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:43,730
members are really an integral part of

257
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,889
that process yeah we're we're really

258
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:48,590
excited to be a part of this and of

259
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:51,110
course thankful to you who Omar you

260
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:53,720
stood on our board we have countless

261
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,430
attorneys that have contributed so much

262
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,649
time to this project and we're really

263
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:00,949
excited about that

264
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:04,189
you had mentioned that sorry let me just

265
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:06,830
catch up to my thought on it you had

266
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,440
mentioned that the fee structure seems

267
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:11,750
both over burdensome and inadequate

268
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,510
right and so it's sort of on both sides

269
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,360
it's lacking a little bit under the

270
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:19,580
proposed fee structure it seems like the

271
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,470
burden to establish an appellation would

272
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,009
fall on the farmers that need it the

273
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,779
most

274
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:26,000
so maybe the ones that are under the

275
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:28,939
most financial duress at times certainly

276
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,460
like this one that we're in right now at

277
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,980
the same time my understanding is that

278
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,990
anyone could then take advantage of that

279
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,500
appellation as long as they adhere to

280
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:41,090
the standards that the appellation sets

281
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,759
forth and so could you tell us a little

282
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:47,030
bit about the dynamics of maybe having a

283
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,889
group of ten farmers from the eel River

284
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,899
apply for an appellation around the eel

285
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:53,629
River and then having sort of a

286
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:55,039
different set of people come in and take

287
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:57,350
advantage of that appellation is that a

288
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,990
concern that we should have here that

289
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,060
perhaps the people that are funding the

290
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,680
appellations Oversight Committee aren't

291
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:05,349
necessarily the ones that are able to

292
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,789
take advantage of this in the long term

293
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,440
that's a good point that you bring in

294
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:11,719
because you know they would have to be

295
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,150
within the same geographical region and

296
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,250
then also adhere to the same standards

297
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:18,470
practices or cultivars that are

298
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,200
specified for the appellation

299
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:24,500
but there's going to be a piggybacking

300
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,070
problem right like if you say only those

301
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:31,340
who submitted the petition can use the

302
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:33,680
appellation that also seems unfair and

303
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,240
short-sighted because as with wine

304
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,069
Appalachians many of these wine

305
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,980
Appalachians were established decades

306
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,720
ago you know and a lot of the companies

307
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,050
and the individuals who initially

308
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,790
proposed those wine Appalachians they

309
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:48,349
are no longer in the wine business you

310
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:51,849
know they've sold their businesses or

311
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:55,519
you know they passed on and so I think

312
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:58,070
we we do have a free rider problem with

313
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,679
people piggybacking and you know that is

314
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:03,710
a problem that many growers are facing

315
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:06,319
which which is you know growers thinking

316
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,060
like why should I be the one to invest

317
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,940
all this time and money in establishing

318
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:13,519
a new appellation when others the Free

319
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,860
Riders behind me will come along and try

320
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,929
to cash in on my appellation and then

321
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,539
the better question is like how do you

322
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:22,729
enforce the standards or the practices

323
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:24,949
or the cultivars for the appellation how

324
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,620
do you keep other licensed growers from

325
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:30,259
claiming the appellation but not really

326
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,019
a d-ring to the standards practices or

327
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:35,379
cultivars and therefore diluting the

328
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:37,579
goodwill associated with that particular

329
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:40,730
appellation those are really good

330
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:43,280
questions and questions I'm sure that

331
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,710
we'll get into in depth on April 2nd

332
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,529
right yes something I'm very excited

333
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,450
about is that you know while we were

334
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:54,019
brainstorming we came up with the idea

335
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:56,230
of having a CEO that identifies official

336
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:58,610
cannabis appellations in California and

337
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,100
initially I proposed having two seals

338
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,320
one official seal that said official

339
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,680
California cannabis appellation it would

340
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,129
have the fancy you know like what's it

341
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:11,769
called the Outer Ring

342
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:14,360
yeah like the Apple yeah like the

343
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:16,429
European seals and then there will be a

344
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,230
second seal that would be proposed and

345
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:20,209
it would have a uniform design element

346
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:24,320
on the outside and then on the inside

347
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:26,180
the proponent or the petitioner would

348
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,370
have their own design that they would

349
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:32,159
propose and so I like that idea and

350
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:35,339
unfortunately you know

351
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:38,250
it seems like real estate when it comes

352
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:40,470
to packaging and labeling in such short

353
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,899
supply that it's not practical to really

354
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,839
have two seals and so Mary Shapiro has

355
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:48,089
suggested just having the one seal which

356
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,860
would be the outer ring would have a

357
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:51,240
uniform design element which would

358
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,220
probably say official California

359
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,379
cannabis appellation and then on the

360
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:59,250
inside it would be like blank and so

361
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:01,139
there the proponent could you know

362
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,778
propose their own design and they would

363
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:07,528
have their own creativity and then there

364
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:11,389
will be a small modest fee to use that

365
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:14,188
official seal and that would also help

366
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:17,610
you know fund the cannabis appellations

367
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:20,338
program because the way that the

368
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,019
regulations are structured currently is

369
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:23,610
they basically want to fund that the

370
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:27,269
cannabis appellations program in

371
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:30,750
perpetuity by having really high fees at

372
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:32,818
the beginning and then no fees ever ever

373
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,860
after and that to me sounds like a

374
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:37,740
recipe for establishing a program that

375
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,169
will end up weathering a way for lack of

376
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,198
funding and just kind of dying into

377
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:46,259
irrelevance and so we are making several

378
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:50,028
proposals for establishing different

379
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:52,800
sources of funding you know such as

380
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:54,838
having like you know renewals for

381
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,879
Appalachians every ten years so they had

382
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,699
to pay a little bit more money to keep

383
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:02,399
that Appalachian current but really like

384
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:06,029
having an official seal would

385
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,548
incentivize official enforcement against

386
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:11,038
misuse because now anybody who is

387
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:13,529
counterfeiting that seal is misusing an

388
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:16,408
official seal and then there would also

389
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:18,838
be a value to the producers they'll be

390
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:21,240
happy to pay some money to use the seal

391
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,609
because they know that the state of

392
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,538
California now has an interest and is

393
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:27,240
willing to allocate its resources

394
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:29,279
towards enforcement so I'm really

395
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,859
excited about this idea that we all

396
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,710
collectively came up with of having an

397
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:37,139
official seal for cannabis appellations

398
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:40,440
that can be put on cannabis products and

399
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,240
can help identify cannabis products

400
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,500
yeah I mean I that sounds like a great

401
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,779
idea from a couple different

402
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,339
perspectives obviously from the official

403
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:51,690
steel use and sort of having an inner

404
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:54,990
walking an interlocking type of seal

405
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,460
that had that that you know that idea

406
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,650
that this was sanctioned by the state

407
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,019
and then had the more specific sort of

408
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,430
logo in there and then of course you

409
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:04,589
mentioned the problem with funding

410
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:07,080
enforcement of this going forward you

411
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:10,409
know and if enforcement does fall to the

412
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:12,179
CBF a you know we here and and for those

413
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,710
of us that have seen the development of

414
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,960
Appalachians you know we're aware that

415
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,430
the wine and the cheese industries have

416
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,769
spent tens of millions of dollars

417
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,170
enforcing these very specific marks that

418
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:23,970
become very valuable over time and

419
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,590
without that enforcement mechanism and

420
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,150
without adequately funding that

421
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:29,369
enforcement mechanism the Appalachian

422
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,750
who really doesn't mean much so I love

423
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:33,359
that idea it's the first time that I've

424
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,589
heard of it and it's the you know that

425
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,569
this idea of sort of an interlocking

426
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:38,909
seal which would certainly go towards

427
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:40,259
both of those points you know current

428
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,240
recognition of the Appalachian and

429
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:44,160
potential future funding of enforcement

430
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,809
and continuing the program into

431
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,400
perpetuity because that's the idea is

432
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:48,629
that we're gonna set this up in twenty

433
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,759
thousand dollars today

434
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,950
isn't gonna do much for enforcement and

435
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,420
you know twenty years down the road so

436
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,700
that's right the money she's gonna be

437
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,250
sitting in like some you know state fund

438
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,470
it's not gonna be like you know sitting

439
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:07,490
there yeah go towards the government

440
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:07,490
bailout the cruise ship industry Omar

441
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:12,689
okay Omar thank you so much for for

442
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,490
chatting with us this morning we're

443
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,340

you for for continuing to come even

445
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:21,569
though we're doing it online instead of

446
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:23,579
in person we're trying to recreate some

447
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:25,799
of those wonderful things that we get to

448
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,240
do in person while we're going through

449
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,859
this difficult time so we really

450
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,630
appreciate your continued support and

451
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:33,449
