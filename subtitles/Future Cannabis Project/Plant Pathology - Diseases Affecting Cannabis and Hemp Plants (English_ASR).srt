2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:15,359
dr. Wong I wanted to say it was a

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,730
pleasure you know hearing your talk

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,919
today it was very informative

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,140
I'm Paul Santos and I worked for a

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,600
private diagnostic lab called Waypoint

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,849
analytical and we're located in Anaheim

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,740
California it was very interesting to

9
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,420
hear you list a lot of the diseases that

10
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:31,858
you were talking about because we've

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,410
been offering this service for quite

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,960
some time - ever since cannabis became

13
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,578
legal in California and we were seeing

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,100
many of the diseases that you were

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,539
speaking about in your presentation so

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,579
it was kind of nice to kind of get that

17
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,469
confirmation that both of us as

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,420
pathologists were seeing the same issues

19
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,670
that are facing many of the growers of

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,510
this crop so some of the issues that we

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,559
see most often were repeated in your

22
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:59,159
presentation you know things like

23
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:03,718
Fusarium causing both no crown rot root

24
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:06,269
rot stem rot Pythium root rot we're not

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,570
dealing so much with the hemp production

26
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:11,819
side of the industry most of ours is

27
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,349
medicinal or recreational so we don't

28
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,809
get to see a lot of the field grown

29
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:18,449
things that you were mentioning you know

30
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,009
with the seed related issues most of the

31
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,618
clients that we service they're

32
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,930
obtaining their plant material from from

33
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:27,209
propagation houses or they're doing

34
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,729
their own clonal cuttings and rooting

35
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:31,048
their own material so we do see a lot of

36
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:33,150
that Fusarium that you were talking

37
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,979
about that can get transmitted you know

38
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,240
from infected mothers stalks so I

39
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,578
thought that was very important issue

40
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,429
that you brought up yeah and that's true

41
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:46,319
so I work for a state of Nevada

42
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:48,659
Department of Agriculture so as a parent

43
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,209
pathologist I deal with everything not

44
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,000
just industrial hemp and also marijuana

45
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:57,139
plants so for some reason during those

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,149
two years yes there's there's a lot of

47
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,879
problem with Association d'Ãªtre hemp and

48
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,968
their cannabis production in the nevada

49
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:09,239
so we have a chance to locate those

50
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:11,939
issue would take a lot of sample we

51
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,439
accept sample so with two analysis with

52
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:16,199
to recognize thick and

53
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:19,079
also to the DNA barcoding to identify

54
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,909
what kind of past you in there so we can

55
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,820
figure out what's wrong with all those

56
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:26,549
issues so we would you fund a lot of

57
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:29,909
diseases which that's why I'm excited to

58
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,770
present in the in the Congress yeah I

59
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:33,629
agree totally with you because I think

60
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,120
you know one of the one of the one of

61
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,599
the benefits of legalization of

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,400
marijuana or the greater extent of

63
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:44,400
growing hemp as a as an industrial crop

64
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,110
is that now we're being able to open

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,659
that industry up to the much-needed

66
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,420
science because there's a there's a big

67
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,159
gap in our in our in the knowledge that

68
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:56,369
we have with respect to the diseases

69
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,799
that impact both marijuana and the hamp

70
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,150
crops so it's kind of exciting we kind

71
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,550
of feel like maybe we're on the cutting

72
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,530
edge right at the frontier trying to

73
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,570
find new things and discovering new

74
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,300
things that impact this crop and the

75
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,250
growers are trying to yeah I feel the

76
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,680
same way because every time we're

77
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,469
located Academy so he's a industrial

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,870
hemp or medical marijuana plants

79
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:21,060
there's nobody have done very much work

80
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,150
on that so anything funding from that

81
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,759
time across it could be no disease or

82
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,280
some kind of new conditions so the

83
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,409
growers need the information to to

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,569
resolve the problem so but unfortunately

85
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:36,209
not very many people will work on that

86
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:39,109
a lot of people contact saying they have

87
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:41,310
research facility they have a technique

88
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,650
advantage but they just don't want to

89
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,590
work on that for example I got talking

90
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,810
about virus there's something infected

91
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,909
by some kind of virus but we cannot

92
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,430
figure out what it is so they need some

93
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:56,459
kind of research to figure out so future

94
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,840
people welcome yeah I know I it makes me

95
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,280
wish that maybe I was more of a

96
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,180
virologist and not so much of a

97
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,259
mycologist

98
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,670
you know I don't know what your

99
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,379
expertise words are what you specialize

100
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:06,389
in when you were in graduate school but

101
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:08,219
I do see like a lot of a lot of clients

102
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:10,469
ask questions about viruses and I

103
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:12,750
honestly talk to Tonga you know aside

104
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:15,120
from hearing maybe you know him prosaic

105
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,220
I don't know much else alright yeah but

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,430
by training myself it's a new

107
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,010
mythologist also plant pathologists and

108
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,139
also molecular biologists so actually a

109
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,730
conservative nurse but is in there for

110
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:30,209
an apprentice knowledge as

111
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:33,840
I was taught more focus on the soil

112
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:37,289
fungus or numb toes and the virus or

113
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,789
some apprentices so you mentioned

114
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,800
nematodes room I did have one question

115
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,319
that I get it didn't get to ask you

116
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,300
during your presentation and maybe I

117
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,519
don't know if I heard right or not but

118
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,650
was it the the it's mostly the lesion

119
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,849
nematode is the one of primary problem

120
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:56,189
on him or we're not real sure yet the

121
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,950
reason I point out Tunisian themselves

122
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:02,160
which is called the Prater lenka's is

123
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:05,370
because we found this from the from the

124
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,520
potato field from from some fields

125
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:11,449
because I talked about tonight

126
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:14,069
root rot the reason why root was so

127
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:16,019
devastating is just because could it be

128
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:20,099
some kind of them thoughts take some

129
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:21,919
roll and to make Anna plants more

130
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,140
susceptible

131
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,810
so that's why I addressed it numb totes

132
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,430
you know in the disease complex I'll be

133
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,920
very interesting to be interesting to

134
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,259
see what you find out yeah but we walk

135
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,960
on there so oh yeah I think there's one

136
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,779
grower from New Mexico he asked about it

137
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,239
did you find that very senior very

138
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:45,659
senior wilt since we found for Sarah

139
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,910
will some other diseases but he's got

140
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:51,320
some kind of problem with releasing him

141
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:54,930
which is a big issue for some crop like

142
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,849
permanent is a huge right problem but so

143
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,160
far I haven't found any from the

144
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,320
cannabis here right so I still pay

145
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,840
attention to it because every time the

146
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,790
sample came in they kind of royalty or

147
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,669
some kind of disease go yeah

148
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:11,760
I always check for vertice to make sure

149
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:13,080
there's anything yeah sure sure yeah I'd

150
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,849
have to say in the samples that we've

151
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,139
received we've never seen vertice them

152
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,730
either but you know it's something

153
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,879
that's always on your radar for sure

154
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:24,300
yeah yeah that's that's that's good too

155
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,850
yeah don't have any vertice no no no no

156
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,770
nobody wants it nobody wish if there is

157
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,410
one disease though that that I didn't

158
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:33,719
see mentioned on your on your survey

159
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,970
that you've been conducting and one that

160
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,930
we begin we've been seeing of late and

161
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,590
that's a sale a biopsis

162
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,500
causing our

163
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:45,779
root rot but also invading the crown at

164
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,459
the bottom of the plant - I don't know

165
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,369
maybe if you've come across that or not

166
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:51,839
no no I haven't if across today yes that

167
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,850
would be very curious to know what

168
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,519
species it is because it's difficult and

169
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,950
it's much slower growing than Halima ops

170
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,319
is particular maybe that's something if

171
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:02,959
we had an isolate that if we sent it to

172
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,009
you would you be interested in maybe

173
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,319
determining what species it is

174
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:09,329
well we're conducting a bar coding so

175
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,480
figure out what it is so if you got

176
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:13,709
chance you can send me some image you

177
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,139
describe what kind of disease look like

178
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:18,989
yeah and then send me some sample or

179
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:21,810
maybe nice relates yeah oh yeah culture

180
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,668
plates we can figure out what species it

181
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,560
is yeah that'd be really cool yeah right

182
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:27,689
and then I don't have time to write

183
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,639
stuff up and I don't have a facility for

184
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:31,709
doing inoculations for Koch's postulates

185
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,329
maybe that's something on urine and you

186
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:34,888
could get a publication out of it well

187
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:36,930
yeah what kind of cooperates so it'll

188
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:40,280
kind of figure out what's wrong with

189
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,280
there was a crowd yeah

190
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:50,420
it's not very much information on the

191
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,480
canvass crop diseases so there's a lot

192
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:55,910
of grower in the u.s. they're gonna grow

193
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,400
a lot of hemp and the course of medical

194
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,860
marijuana plants in the facility they

195
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,139
need information on how to manage those

196
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,879
diseases so they don't have those

197
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:07,810
information and they don't know how to

198
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,699
manage it so let's be the issue and

199
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:13,129
people can do some work to figure out

200
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:16,219
what's wrong with it that's great like

201
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:19,759
couldn't helping them to produce how C

202
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:22,490
can be scrub well I would ask you one

203
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,649
question you know because both you and I

204
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,720
we kind of agree that you know we do

205
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:29,000
cannabis but it's kind of on the side

206
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,460
yeah Messiah is true there are a lot of

207
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,440
other plants and crops that we both deal

208
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:35,569
with right but you know what do you

209
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,480
think is maybe one of the most

210
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:41,030
challenging things the the faces the

211
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,539
cannabis industry with wrist art talking

212
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:45,889
about management of diseases what do you

213
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:49,189
think would be the most challenging

214
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:52,129
thing to growers I think the most

215
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:55,040
challenge is how the grower can get

216
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:59,929
healthy plants because I talked to one

217
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:03,639
of attending she said is any program

218
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:06,439
that really can provide healthy stalk

219
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:08,509
healthy plants and they can start from

220
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,090
the very beginning that principle they

221
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:13,899
have is healthy a healthy so let's be

222
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:16,759
challenged so I said no nobody really

223
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:18,620
really to this kind of scene so maybe in

224
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,830
the future there's a direction to do

225
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,830
that

226
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:31,759
our teacher coach on the generate

227
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:33,560
disease of free stock plans or gym

228
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,980
plasma whatever they call it

229
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:40,669
so you just get our work mean disease

230
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:44,329
free clean stock to start with cannabis

231
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:45,979
growing business right so that's

232
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:48,828
probably the best way let's call the

233
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:52,509
prevention so and once on the challenge

234
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:56,059
is that there's no chemical product like

235
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:58,699
pesticide or fungicide nylon label for

236
00:09:56,059 --> 00:10:01,369
cannabis so they cannot use it for

237
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:03,708
cannabis crop so they have to use some

238
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:06,948
alternative product and they may not be

239
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:09,500
very effective depends on what kind of

240
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:12,469
condition the treat so that's allows a

241
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,750
challenge for them to you and so they're

242
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:18,439
almost forced to be organic growers by

243
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:21,948
default right technology it is no it's

244
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:23,659
gonna that's not so bad it's not that

245
00:10:21,948 --> 00:10:27,639
it's impossible but it's it's much more

246
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:27,639
challenging yeah right yes challenge

247
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,720
well in order to do virus testing you

248
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:38,750
need to have specialized equipment there

249
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,160
are some Eliza based kits that are on

250
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,278
available on the market

251
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:45,679
but the biggest problem is that we don't

252
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:49,309
have a firm understanding of what

253
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:51,500
viruses have been described on cannabis

254
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:54,919
in the first place right would you agree

255
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,320
yeah that's true so even though we can

256
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:00,019
test the virus but we don't know what

257
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,050
kind of arts to test for so you have to

258
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:06,769
know what species you want to test for

259
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:08,328
that specific virus so a lot of time we

260
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:09,769
just don't know what to test for so

261
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:11,989
that's that's kind of people challenge

262
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:14,778
so when there's a way to do that they

263
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:17,269
call the next generation sequences so

264
00:11:14,778 --> 00:11:20,389
that way you can you don't need to know

265
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:23,120
the target but you can detect whatever

266
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:25,309
it's inside the plants based on the

267
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,578
wrong way so you can test this specific

268
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:30,649
of a virus or even a novel new virus in

269
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:32,569
the plants so that's technology in there

270
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:36,379
but it just kind of cost too much money

271
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:38,600
time to do that so we don't know what

272
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:43,778
type of virus I have felt the cannabis

273
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,778
crop and it's still question mark

274
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:54,069
I would say that the diseases are

275
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,009
regional I mean there are some

276
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,020
commonalities but for example you know

277
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:01,179
in California and I would imagine you

278
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:03,279
here in Nevada that's probably the same

279
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,649
where it tends to be more arid you know

280
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,419
we're gonna see one subset of diseases

281
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:09,459
are gonna be more common to our area

282
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:11,740
whereas if you're a grower or say like

283
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,570
in Kentucky maybe there may be foliar

284
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,539
diseases that we were never gonna see

285
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,980
just because we don't have the rainfall

286
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:20,559
that's right that's right because in a

287
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,509
given region now see in the Midwest or

288
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,549
in the back of yeast they may be good

289
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:27,009
high humidity nikka some other diseases

290
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:29,500
which we don't see very much in the

291
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:33,250
Western like especially in Nevada is

292
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,740
pretty dry arid condition so may not see

293
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,230
very often like say powdery mildew you

294
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,409
may see very much in some other part of

295
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:43,920
the United States but not in Nevada

296
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:48,360
prominent so that's not something that's

297
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,360
environmental environment dependent

298
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:58,389
well as I present in the this morning I

299
00:12:55,389 --> 00:13:02,110
said the prevention is a key so try to

300
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:06,190
prevent introduction any type of disease

301
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:10,740
agent into your facility so that's best

302
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:15,430
way to prevent disease and also try to

303
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:18,220
monitor your facility make sure you keep

304
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:20,828
track on that once you see the disease

305
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,610
you have to take action right away as

306
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:27,489
soon as possible before they spread or

307
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:31,028
overwhelming in the facility so that's

308
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:33,129
my takeaway message for those growers I

309
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:35,500
think that's an excellent point you know

310
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:39,338
that prevention through good sanitation

311
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:41,679
that has to be the foundation of any

312
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:45,100
program especially in in cannabis well

313
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:47,828
your options for control once disease

314
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,959
outbreak has occurred are so limited i I

315
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:52,649
agree told you know wholeheartedly with

316
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,649
that yeah

317
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:03,680
well me personally when I think back to

318
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,840
to my my days as a graduate student you

319
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,899
know I think that the number one risk of

320
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,780
growing something that's a monoculture

321
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:14,990
and is you know genetically uniform like

322
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:16,519
when you're using clonal stock the the

323
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,590
problem is that if you do get a path

324
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,379
into this introduction then and they're

325
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:24,170
all susceptible then the risk for for a

326
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:26,539
spread and for a greater loss in yield

327
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:29,029
is is significantly higher than if you

328
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:30,889
had a diverse cropping system although

329
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:33,949
I'm not sure I would argue that that

330
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:36,049
that crops that are planted outdoors are

331
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,790
any less of a monoculture than those

332
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:39,769
planet indoors even though there may be

333
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:42,169
other things around that environment

334
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:44,029
where these where these cannabis crops

335
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:47,269
are being grown outdoors I mean they

336
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:49,480
could potentially be sources of pathogen

337
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:53,509
inoculum we just don't simply know yet

338
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:56,360
well for sure them monoculture is really

339
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:59,689
make the disease to occur more easily

340
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,629
than the multiple species so the

341
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:06,230
academy's production indoor and it's

342
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:09,470
actually really favorable for some type

343
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:12,740
of diseases for sure so it's it's it's a

344
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,820
really big issue for monoculture it's

345
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:25,408
bad for disease

346
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:25,409
