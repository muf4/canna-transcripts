this is the doctored a verse which which

3
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,579
is about as nice as you gonna get as far

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:23,129
as an email rig it's totally portable

5
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:25,768
cordless you can tune in your

6
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,939
temperature really easily and as you see

7
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:30,689
it hits really smoothly

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,659
and has a lotto she's about to take a

9
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:37,909
hit of our grapefruit rosin which was

10
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,909
pressed from this grapefruit flower

11
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:51,030
no 100% solvent free from that flower

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:54,109
which is grown we're up north

00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:22,129
to go yeah definitely and you can choose

16
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:24,969
like as much as as much as you want as

17
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:27,769
far as like size of your of your inhale

18
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:30,629
and and combine that with your

19
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:33,670
temperature and really that customize

[Music]

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,519
that's like you don't need the blowtorch

26
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:59,030
you don't need to worry about even what

27
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:01,219
your temperature is the previous method

28
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,409
which still has some validity is the

29
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:04,609
blowtorch and your temperature gun so

30
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:08,090
you know exactly where you're getting

31
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:10,489
your your titanium nail at this is just

32
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:14,030
a standard rig that we converted and to

33
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:17,680
just your traditional you know rig

34
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:25,459
you know just three-stage percolator

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:26,640
okay so I guess that concentrates market

36
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:29,990
can be kind of

37
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:34,679
but you know split up and obviously like

38
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:38,930
dabbing but also yeah definitely

39
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,930
what are you guys seeing in the market

40
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:45,239
well a big part of what we settled on is

41
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,509
just like our own end user experience

42
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,719
with cut with concentrates and there is

43
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:54,090
a bigger push for kind of a response to

44
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,389
like solvents being used as a response

45
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:00,539
to like Dho going with solvent free and

46
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:03,239
so we you know I've been making that

47
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,459
product for a few years now and so I was

48
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,600
also had some insight and recognizing

49
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,180
that you could still get a good quality

50
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,849
product without having to did you

51
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,700
utilize any any sort of solvents or and

52
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:17,819
you're always gonna have people that are

53
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,109
diehard BHO fans or solvent ethanol fans

54
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,120
and that's fine because you can still

55
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,300
make good quality product it would those

56
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,000
with those methods ours is just really

57
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,550
making it simple kind of going back to

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,090
how it used to be just this is heat and

59
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,680
pressure and basically hashish and in

60
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,539
full spectrum which is another thing you

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,060
see across the board with like teachers

62
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:41,429
topicals pop on berkeley like you know

63
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,289
they're big big on full spectrum for all

64
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:49,890
all of the teachers and we definitely

65
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:51,569
respect them as a brand they're doing

66
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:53,819
the same thing that we're doing as far

67
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:56,129
as using just heat and pressure to

68
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:59,759
extract their hash oil and then using

69
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:02,250
that homogenizing that with their custom

70
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,199
blend of oils for their various products

71
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,739
so then what's great about it is once

72
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,389
you've dialed in your hash product you

73
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,340
can find out what your cannabinoid

74
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,988
ratios are and then just combine that

75
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,370
with you whatever carrier oil you're

76
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,659
working with and you can really get a

77
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,668
consistent product that's like

78
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:21,579
full-spectrum 100% quality every time

79
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:23,408
talk about

80
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:26,710
you know everybody thinks of DAP I mean

81
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:28,839
of Rossum presses is kind of like you're

82
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:31,870
doing small batch so how do you how do

83
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:35,579
you paint the vision of a manufacturing

84
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:38,199
facility that well really in in order to

85
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:41,198
get the quality it needs to be at that

86
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,180
scale it's it's really impossible to

87
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,370
completely upscale on the same way that

88
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,610
you could with with BHO or ethanol

89
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,939
machines just because of the physics of

90
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,788
it

91
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:54,819
so what it requires is a lot of labour

92
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:56,318
so this product is is born out of love

93
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:57,848
like well if you're gonna be involved in

94
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,310
making rod at Rossum you're you're gonna

95
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:03,310
want to be committed to doing things and

96
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,199
not necessarily the easy way it needs it

97
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,829
takes a lot of fine-tuning a lot of

98
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,718
back-and-forth each bag just by looking

99
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:13,329
at each bag that we packed full of

100
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:14,709
cannabis you know it each one's a little

101
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:17,529
bit different a little bit thicker a

102
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:18,939
little bit longer wider and it's amazing

103
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:20,948
what you can pull out of it and so that

104
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:22,718
affects how quickly you're gonna press

105
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:25,860
down you know what pressure you're gonna

106
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:25,860
start with end up with

107
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,439
well like what did what did he bitch to

108
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,240
you about recently and what did he bitch

109
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,839
about to you recently and like I was

110
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,240
frustrated about our excitedly well the

111
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,759
other day he wanted a little bit lighter

112
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,259
color out of the rosin so I had to do

113
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,959
some experimenting you know on the

114
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:57,649
temperature and also on the bag the

115
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:59,689
micron size of the bag and it you know

116
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:03,969
took a few hours about half the day but

117
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:03,969
I gave him the results that he wanted

118
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:09,769
I used a smaller micron bag and it

119
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:12,439
reduces your yield but it gives you a

120
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:13,909
little bit higher quality and lowered

121
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:18,529
the temperature just a little bit which

122
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:21,680
also can reduce the yield but it's all

123
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:24,319
it's a lot of you know experimenting and

124
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,800
each bag you know you drop down five

125
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,300
degrees it still doesn't give you the

126
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,040
effect you want you got a you know pack

127
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,710
another bag and try it again

128
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,970
so there's a lot if you really pay

129
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:37,849
attention to the variables of

130
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:40,880
temperature pressure and then you know

131
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:43,760
micro micron size time and then bag

132
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,769
geometry which is how big is it because

133
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,209
there's the pressure of your machine but

134
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:49,329
what's really hat what's where's the

135
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:52,759
pressure at the bag and so that is

136
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:55,009
directly related to your bag geometry so

137
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:56,719
once you dial in one you just gotta have

138
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:59,079
to keep pushing forward with you know

139
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,740
answering some of the other variables

140
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:05,569
but it's it's working as far as mass or

141
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,180
as far as manufacturing it's it's doable

142
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:16,129
and we're working off of one press and

143
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:18,350
we could definitely do a lot more yeah

144
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:25,279
it stands up eh oh it's like right here

145
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:26,930
end of the table to about oh the surface

146
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,989
of all the heat the actual heat plate is

147
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,639
it's only about you know twelve inches

148
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,009
by two and a half inches three inches

149
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,810
and the reason why you want that is so

150
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,459
I've worked with larger plates as well

151
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,280
like so if you imagine a really large

152
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:42,589
plate you can get a larger mass that you

153
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,689
are you know pressing but it's not gonna

154
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:46,089
press this evenly and then if you once

155
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:48,129
that oil starting to be

156
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:49,989
did you want it to get off those plates

157
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:53,579
as quickly as possible and cooled down

158
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:56,290
as quickly as possible that's exactly so

159
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:58,839
exactly so narrow plate you could you

160
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,430
get your bag packed up right to it all

161
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,439
of that squish is gonna come out and

162
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,090
then you can even collect it onto a cold

163
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:11,430
plate if you want something that's been

164
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:14,079
in the freezer exactly yeah yeah yep yep

165
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,689
and you there are presses out there that

166
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,490
are our square shape peer-pressured

167
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:20,860
makes a great press I love their press

168
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,509
and and I and that's what I use and the

169
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,000
reason why I like them more than

170
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:28,509
anything was their attention to their

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,550
plate sizes and not and really not

172
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,599
focusing on like more pressure means

173
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,639
more yield because that's not

174
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,288
necessarily true like there's a sweet

175
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,848
spot that you need to you need to find

176
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:39,729
him you can actually get great yield

177
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:41,950
great and maintain quality without you

178
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,570
know going like super excess of pressure

179
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,710
or super excess of heat because those

180
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:56,860
are the two typical ways that you

181
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:59,920
typically boost up you absolutely even

182
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,330
how fast the plate compresses so if

183
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,829
you're with flour you want a fast

184
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,379
compression when you're doing something

185
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,550
like kief or bubble hash something

186
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,049
that's a little bit more dense you want

187
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:11,229
to slow down that press you could

188
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:14,259
potentially make the bag explode or

189
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:16,180
cause it to heat like I'm heat unevenly

190
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:18,879
so it's so there's a lot of factors but

191
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:20,799
but once it's what's nice about it

192
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,500
though it's mechanical all its it's

193
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,209
simple and calm it's not complex it's

194
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,549
simple it's still mechanical process

195
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,009
it's easy to control your variables your

196
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:31,539
runs are fast and once you've once

197
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:34,389
you've figured out for this particular

198
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:38,639
strain or that or this technique he's

199
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:38,639
dialed in it's just to can go I mean

200
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,769
[Music]

201
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,720
two to three inches so when you guys are

202
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:47,698
doing this at scale like how many

203
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,320
precedents do you have in your visit or

204
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:52,769
how many of you envision having in your

205
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,930
facility I I'd say probably like five or

206
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:56,578
five to ten just really depending on

207
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:58,799
Broome I mean ultimately that's what it

208
00:09:56,578 --> 00:10:04,559
really boils down to and just go in all

209
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:07,078
day 24/7 absolutely 24/7 easy so what

210
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,000
are like some when you guys are talking

211
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:17,729
to each other like innovations you want

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:20,039
to see something that I'd like to see is

213
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,778
something that I like that mean I think

214
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,480
peer pressure has got the plate size

215
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:26,759
down and and the right amount of tonnage

216
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,459
that they're using but I also appreciate

217
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,379
a hand app and press it would be nice to

218
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:34,739
see a good quality combination of the

219
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:36,629
two especially when you're exactly

220
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,448
especially when you're first learning to

221
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:41,610
press there's nothing that replaces like

222
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:44,159
that connection to feeling the bag and

223
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:48,300
and and really understanding physically

224
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:51,208
what's going on and and that actually as

225
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:53,849
you get more versed in the extraction

226
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:56,278
you can use that as a quick way to

227
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,620
diagnose of you know remedy or do some

228
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,539
troubleshooting is by just like alright

229
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,818
what is actually going on physically at

230
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:05,028
the bag that seems kind of silly but it

231
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:05,028
works

232
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:14,259
[Music]

233
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:17,649
in like five minutes

234
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:19,119
I am definitely interested in tinctures

235
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:20,948
one of the things that I really

236
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:23,139
appreciate about our rosin and our rosin

237
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:25,359
line is speaking you can also make you

238
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:26,829
know instead of having be edible or you

239
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,709
don't really know what your dough scene

240
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:31,599
is it's like having a nice one you know

241
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:33,758
a milliliter dropper with it at a dose

242
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,249
that I know where it's at and I also

243
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,409
know that that has come from like a

244
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:43,569
solvent free immunity and it's full full

245
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:45,039
spectrum that and I mean those actually

246
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:53,078
those are the two big things being rosin

247
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:59,498
and tinctures really taking rosin oh

248
00:11:53,078 --> 00:12:01,448
that's really hot so live resin I mean

249
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:03,819
that's basically cryogenic technique

250
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:06,058
where you are making sure that the the

251
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:09,159
trichomes on their plant are frozen

252
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:13,389
right you know when you write at that

253
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:15,278
time before just before harvest where

254
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:18,159
the terpenes on the on your fresh plant

255
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,528
are so like just Turkey it they smell so

256
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,749
good and then you know you you you cut

257
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:24,789
you dry and you cure and it doesn't

258
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:26,290
quite have that same that impact and

259
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:27,458
that's because though all those terpenes

260
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:29,379
have volatilized

261
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:31,808
so that with the the live resin

262
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:33,870
processes and like fresh frozen because

263
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:36,399
they're taking care taking that plant

264
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,769
trimming it and then within hours

265
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,178
hopefully instantaneously getting it in

266
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:42,399
into a freezer

267
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:44,289
that's flash frozen and then that

268
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,909
preserves all those terpenes that's

269
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:49,480
really exciting you can use that same

270
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:51,159
flower to make rosin BHO any sort of x

271
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,528
extraction and you're gonna you're gonna

272
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:55,539
have a much wider terpene profile to

273
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:57,759
play with and you know a different

274
00:12:55,539 --> 00:13:02,438
experience for the product because of

275
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:04,499
that absolutely yeah they're small

276
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:07,348
smaller the molecular weight

277
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:10,439
it seems like everything should or is

278
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:12,929
focused on kind of how do you keep as

279
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:15,178
much of the yes into that plan yeah

280
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:17,158
exactly right exactly

281
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:21,269
what innovations are you seeing there

282
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:25,139
and nothing losing none of the essence

283
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:29,068
of what was in the flower today I think

284
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,869
really fresh frozen is probably the

285
00:13:29,068 --> 00:13:32,998
closest thing and just doing what we're

286
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:35,009
doing with with rosin is trying is

287
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:36,658
trying to create a product that is as

288
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:39,058
close to the flower as possible so like

289
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:41,158
if you were smell you know our flower

290
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:42,448
that's been pressed or the the rosin

291
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:46,068
that's been pressed from the flower they

292
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:46,068
have the same terpene profile the same

293
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:54,208
what do you guys see like what are the

294
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:55,709
first to go off the top of my head it

295
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:58,018
couldn't tell you but they I could tell

296
00:13:55,708 --> 00:14:02,518
you they go start to come off around 170

297
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:04,229
Celsius and man it's not little blue but

298
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,808
I kept the top of my etiquette I can't

299
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:09,599
tell you but I but it's trying to do low

300
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:14,639
temp presses is really what's what is

301
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:18,379
gonna capture can keep all those between

302
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:21,839
one 70s in South this is in Celsius or

303
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:25,038
between 90 and 170 Celsius and so you're

304
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,599
gonna actually start to get terpenes

305
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:29,548
volatilizing much sooner than not at 170

306
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:32,908
Celsius but like at 70 degrees like even

307
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:36,418
you have room temperature and so trying

308
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:39,389
to make sure that you know you keep keep

309
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:41,369
as much as you can without you know we'd

310
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:42,418
still getting a product that's the

311
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:43,739
balance because you still have to have

312
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:45,629
yield you still have to have something

313
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:48,599
you have to get something you could you

314
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:51,869
could use all pressure and very very low

315
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:54,809
temperature and get you know capture the

316
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:58,288
most terpene profile but you're you're

317
00:14:54,808 --> 00:15:00,208
gonna probably get 10th to 20th of what

318
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:03,588
you should if you you know kind of bump

319
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,588
up the temperature and find that happen

320
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:11,509
absolutely well exactly and you can also

321
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:13,429
do mechanical separations so we've been

322
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:16,068
able to do like low temp mechanical

323
00:15:13,428 --> 00:15:17,899
separations and get THCA that's actually

324
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:19,909
something I'm really excited about and

325
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:21,409
it's it's really nice to be able to get

326
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:24,738
again thca

327
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:27,618
without having to use solvents and it's

328
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:29,600
it's a real straightforward process with

329
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:31,249
with rosin you're just you're doing a

330
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,040
mechanical separation through really

331
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:36,259
fine screens multiple runs and you're

332
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:37,399
collecting your turf terpenes that are

333
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:38,808
pouring off and you're you so you're

334
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,308
collecting that and your product is

335
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:41,838
actually what's on the inside which

336
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:43,668
would typically be your waste product

337
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,359
you know the chip the flour chip or the

338
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:50,659
keys chip that you throw away or recycle

339
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:53,839
this the actual product is THC a crystal

340
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:57,499
that's been the last stuff we got tested

341
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:07,209
was like ninety nine six all without so

342
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:07,209
all without solvents how can you tell

343
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:18,139
I'm actually his apprentice he really

344
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:20,899
I'm just learning the ropes but I think

345
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:24,308
I'm on my way to really learning the you

346
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:24,308
know the chemistry behind the planet

347
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:33,259
brain hurt because it got such a workout

348
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:35,928
well at first I didn't believe him that

349
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:37,938
each bag would be a different and each

350
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:40,249
one would take you know you have to keep

351
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:42,588
your eyes on it to an extreme early and

352
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:45,949
you got to know how it responds and how

353
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:50,460
it likes to be treated and it really is

354
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:52,289
an art rosin pressing and it's

355
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:58,580
it's taken my interest to a whole nother

356
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:58,579
level and I really love every second
