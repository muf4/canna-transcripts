1
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,750
one of the biggest conversations going

2
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:22,269
on right now in the industry is

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,759
resiliency you know especially amongst

4
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:27,879
people that don't have corporate funding

5
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:29,589
or don't have a lot of money coming in

6
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:31,299
and again I'm not I'm not saying good

7
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:33,729
bad or indifferent about where people

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,350
are sourcing their capital I'm not I'm

9
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:37,000
not saying anything about who people are

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,469
partners with none of that really

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,140
matters because we all have the

12
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:43,299
opportunity to touch our soul our

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,789
culture into it and help shift and

14
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:48,429
direct things regardless of who's

15
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:50,320
funding and who's helping us keep keep

16
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:52,119
alive and keep resilient in the market

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,939
so one of the one of the big questions

18
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:57,609
that gets faced a lot is as a small

19
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:59,920
brand as a small farmer how do you

20
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:02,710
survive in a market where there's so

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,769
much regulations required where you have

22
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,780
to as a grower you now have to learn

23
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:10,060
business you now have to learn marketing

24
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,040
you now have to learn track and trace

25
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,618
you have to create all these different

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,420
efficiencies and SOPs and data

27
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:19,329
collection in order to compete in a

28
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,879
market where you know we're used to just

29
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:24,519
duffel bags and and friends coming over

30
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:26,438
to hang out for a little while so one of

31
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:28,438
the one of the ways to move forward and

32
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:30,908
if we really look at the history of

33
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,608
international horticulture in

34
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:35,799
agriculture cooperatives are really the

35
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:37,809
way that such that small farms have

36
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:41,409
really had the ability to come together

37
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,450
and come together under a common brand

38
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:46,299
with a common standard and have the

39
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,999
ability to have an umbrella if you will

40
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:50,469
deal with all the logistics so that the

41
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:51,849
farmer can focus on what they're

42
00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:54,188
passionate about because we're all

43
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:57,009
passionate about different things and if

44
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:59,678
we can link with the right team that has

45
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:02,590
passion about everything it's all about

46
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:04,030
the team and with with creating that

47
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,310
team we have the ability to be resilient

48
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:09,610
and to move forward and these gentlemen

49
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,259
up here I'm gonna let them have a couple

50
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,060
minutes to talk about themselves but I

51
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:16,750

56
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:25,689
I'm really excited about developing our

57
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,409
relationship and hearing more about what

58
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:28,960

for these gentlemen they have done so

62
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:39,449
much in helping us get to where we are

63
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,409
are going and where we are today and and

64
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:43,989
taking all the curve balls that are

65
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:45,969
constantly thrown to us and really I

66
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,070
think if the California cannabis how to

67
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:51,460
face these two gentlemen would be on the

68
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:52,689
back in the front of the face so once

69
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,280
you guys take a moment and take a few

70
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:56,919
minutes just to introduce who you are

71
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,439
what you're doing what you offer and

72
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,089

thank you Jonathan and forever flowering

75
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:11,079
for putting this together not so long

76
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,060
ago I lived on a hill and didn't often

77
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,070
leave it and and one of the mythical

78
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,780
things that existed off of the hill was

79
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,789
forever flowering you know I was still

80
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,620
pulling tarps and like do you did

81
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:22,569
literally the last decade of like coming

82
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,460

83
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,590
damn cool so appreciate you and thank

84
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,969
you my name is Hezekiah Allen I was born

85
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,159
and raised in southern Humboldt County

86
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,919
we were just talking about the earliest

87
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,780
roots of cannabis cultivation by my by

88
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,089
my guess it's here and in southern

89
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,340
Humboldt you know going back to about 65

90
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,080
is the first year I can think of there

91
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,670
that I've been able to like document

92
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,210
folks were growing seedless in both

93
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,709
places

94
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,409
my grandparents started growing in

95
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,360
southern Humboldt in 67 so pretty close

96
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:52,359
they'd been growing in Pennsylvania for

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,950
a couple years before that I was pretty

98
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,020
happy being a grower until my mom

99
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:57,699
decided we were Catholic again so I went

100
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,650
to Catholic High School and did

101
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:01,089
international affairs and traveled the

102
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,310
world for a bit came home and was a

103
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,640
grower again got really tired of

104
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:09,430
watching unnecessary damage to creeks

105
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,649
watersheds Natural Resources ultimately

106
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,210
had a breaking point when a pretty close

107
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,189
home he ended up getting arrested and

108
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,918
going to jail it was one too many people

109
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:20,738
that I knew in jail for cannabis I

110
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,538
decided to be a politician I learned to

111
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:24,310
tie a tie I cut my hair I moved to

112
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:26,288
Sacramento I got to know a lot of

113
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,870
amazing people in places like you and

114
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:31,748
this place and about six months ago I

115
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,310
decided it was time to do the the real

116
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:35,680
thing that I wanted to do be a social

117
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:39,459
entrepreneur go and start a company with

118
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:43,389
a purpose cooperatives fill that gap

119
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:45,759
I am the chair of emerald groan which is

120
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:48,160
a group of cooperatives and then have

121
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,349
recently founded a management company

122
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,360
that basically raises capital and

123
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,790
provides services to coops to help

124
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,650
nurture and stimulate the advancement of

125
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,090
co-operative cannabis that's what we're

126
00:04:56,649 --> 00:05:01,138
here to talk about today so I look

127
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:02,769
forward to talking more in a minute

128
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,250
how's it going

129
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:07,899
Daniel Fink I've been a cultivator for

130
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,139
over half my life I'm originally from

131
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:14,259
upstate New York where I was taught how

132
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:17,110
to grow under lock and key in quite a

133
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:19,389
pirate community the roots in New York

134
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,960
go way back I came to California about

135
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:24,639
ten years ago to move towards compliance

136
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:29,159
to be a medical grower which was always

137
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:32,350
a dream now having the opportunity to go

138
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,620
fully legal and compliant on all levels

139
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:37,770
I've seen a need for working together to

140
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,910
be able to ban small farms together

141
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:42,788
through cooperatives

142
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:45,340
I am the chairperson and co-founder of

143
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:48,459

144
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:51,339

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,550
came pound out of the chopper hood hood

168
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:51,879
so it's been you know a few loops I got

169
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,598
mine in 2008 when I got off probation it

170
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,308
was kind of

171
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:55,990
you know how's this work and the

172
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:57,939
collective model was happening and so we

173
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,619
started doing the collective model and

174
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:01,300
being able to do farmers markets and

175
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,919
having the produce and the cannabis and

176
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,240
you know and when you're you having the

177
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:05,709
farmers market interaction it's this

178
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,119
exchange of like you know this is

179
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:08,649
nourishment this is medicine for your

180
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:10,509
body this is something I produced with

181
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:12,218
love this is for you and that that

182
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:15,009
exchange is like a really powerful thing

183
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:17,110
and that was what really drove us

184
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:19,330
forward into the process was like wow

185
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:23,679
this thing is this this thing can happen

186
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:26,318
and so it's been a hard few years you

187
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:28,929
know I spend a lot less time farming now

188
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,939
a lot more time doing paperwork and the

189
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,619
you know the hope is that we get back to

190
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:35,199
doing farmers markets again that we have

191
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,789
that direct market connection right now

192
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,468
as a farmer we're not allowed to unless

193
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:39,848
you have a retail license and so from

194
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:41,288
the co-operative perspective one of the

195
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:42,728
things I'm really excited about is the

196
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:45,430
idea that a cooperative can hold a

197
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:47,498
retail license and then farms can be

198
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,879
able to vend at events under that retail

199
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:51,399
license so I think there's a lot of

200
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,259
potential in the model and it's

201
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:54,728
something that I've been working on we

202
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:56,830
launched the original iteration of

203
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:58,149
Emerald grown in 2015 it's kind of gone

204
00:07:56,829 --> 00:08:00,188
through a few loops we had an

205
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:01,418
agricultural cooperative for a couple of

206
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,879
years and then when the regulations

207
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:05,558
passed the AG co-op was no longer

208
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:06,908
allowed and so we have to transfer into

209
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:10,088
the the cannabis Cooperative Association

210
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:12,248
so there's three or four projects that

211
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:13,538
are happening now in Mendo and then

212
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:15,369
another couple that are in the pipeline

213
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:17,019
so it's it's something that I'm you know

214
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,550
I remain very excited about but it's

215
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:20,649
also very nascent we're still trying to

216
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,509
figure out the the house and what's and

217
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:24,329
whys and and you know ideally we get rid

218
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:26,288
of the four acre cap and we can

219
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:27,879
conglomerate eyes for lack of better

220
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:29,740
words have more cooperatives all

221
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,259
together in one rather than like a bunch

222
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,668
of different small cooperatives but

223
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,969
that's all kind of into the nuances of

224
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:40,929
the thing and i'm you know i remain

225
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:46,509
excited about it and and glad to see you

226
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:48,429
know the conversation that's a perfect

227
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:49,930
segue actually I really really like you

228
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:52,989
guys to talk a little bit about the

229
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:56,948
legality of coops and what I mean by

230
00:08:52,990 --> 00:09:00,698
that is what laws are coops governed

231
00:08:56,948 --> 00:09:03,539
under what would an individual need to

232
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:06,149
do if they wanted to form a co-op

233
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:08,549
and what are the what you guys see is

234
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,319
the benefits and you've mentioned a

235
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,359
couple of them but the benefits of being

236
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,540
in a co-op and the challenges that

237
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,279
someone might face within one word I'm

238
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:20,189
not a lawyer this isn't legal advice

239
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,870
talk to one before you do anything but

240
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,330
I'm gonna give you my you know my

241
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:27,000
understanding you know basically a

242
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,250
cooperative model the best way I can

243
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,559
think to describe it it's a template for

244
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,200
a specific type of corporation that's

245
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:37,349
governed by the members one vote one

246
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,200
member you can set up any sort of

247
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,750
company to operate cooperatively but the

248
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,990
actual co-operative cannabis Cooperative

249
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,259
Association is a template in state law

250
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,279
it's a relatively prescriptive law

251
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:51,960
meaning it gives you a lot of the

252
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,610
answers it doesn't make you figure a lot

253
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,090
of things out it tells you when to file

254
00:09:53,610 --> 00:10:00,539
your bylaws how long to do this that is

255
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:03,120
chapter 22 of division 10 of the

256
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:05,069
business and Professions Code emerald

257
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,799
grown was you know that one of our

258
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:11,220
primary purposes when formed in 2015 was

259
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:13,439
to advance this law we did pass the law

260
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,060
to go into effect it is in effect now so

261
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,770
that is the cannabis Cooperative

262
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:18,869
Association that provides a few specific

263
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:20,909
benefits there are two that are really

264
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,070
important to hone into the ability to

265
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:24,899
coordinate crops within your membership

266
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,670
and the ability to coordinate pricing

267
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,350
within your membership doing those

268
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:30,509
things with other licensees is

269
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,920
considered anti-competitive you get into

270
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:33,179
the Securities Exchange Commission's

271
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,029
violations you get into financial

272
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:37,769
regulations you can't actually work with

273
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:39,750
competitors to manipulate market

274
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:41,370
conditions as a cooperative you're no

275
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,899
longer competitors you now have this

276
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,909
template for how you relate to one

277
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,319
another like I said you can form a

278
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:48,959
corporation you can consolidate

279
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,910
conglomerate you can get there but the

280
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,050
the the co-operative is a pretty

281
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:54,209
straightforward template

282
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:55,859
the other cool thing is that California

283
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,600
maintains a couple other types of

284
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,340
cooperatives there's a workers coop

285
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,899
where a bunch of workers could get

286
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,700
together and own a processing and

287
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,129
trimming company a very equitable way to

288
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,110
manage employment there's consumers

289
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:09,360
coops I bet you've all been to a natural

290
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,710
foods co-op that is a consumers co-op

291
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,200
those could apply here as well

292
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,300
California also maintains a general

293
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,250
cooperative corporation statute which

294
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:20,129
allows basically any group of

295
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,740
people to form a cooperative corporation

296
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:25,019
for roughly whatever purpose you would

297
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,810
like to form for the benefits are really

298
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,579
simple that you get to be you get to do

299
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:32,339
things that as competitors you wouldn't

300
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:35,009
be able to do in addition to those basic

301
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,110
legal functions the coop also provides a

302
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:37,740
template for bulk buying pushing costs

303
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,990
down

304
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,690
you know efficiencies and staffing

305
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,279
efficiencies in marketing there's a lot

306
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,400
of opportunities but basically that's

307
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:49,019
sort of the legal as I get it if I talk

308
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,399
to a lawyer because I'm not one and

309
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,139
there's a there's also a significant

310
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,569
socio-cultural aspect of it in which

311
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,129
like you have regular meetings and it's

312
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,450
kind of you know this this whole process

313
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,799
for everybody is this emotional

314
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,840
rollercoaster of like I can totally do

315
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,549
this oh boy I don't know if this is

316
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,629
gonna work I can totally do this and on

317
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:05,789
any given day people are at different

318
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:07,740
aspects and in different parts of that

319
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:09,559
ride and so you get everybody together

320
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,389
you know once a month or once a quarter

321
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,649
and it's it's it's like for lack of

322
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:15,210
better terminology like group therapy

323
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,789
where everybody gets to share we talk

324
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:19,259
about what's going on and and you also

325
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:20,370
you know you sharing the challenges

326
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:21,809
you're sharing the solutions to the

327
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,850
challenges people like oh I'm struggling

328
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:25,469
with dfw right now it's like okay well

329
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,759
who's who's you know who's your contact

330
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,500
ever what do you would you know what are

331
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,000
the issues with using a pond is it you

332
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,149
just you know all the different things

333
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,100
and there's the the whole package is so

334
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:38,338
complex and and there's so many

335
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,230
different facets to it that it really

336
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,300
helps to have that that strength of

337
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,220
community of group and being able to

338
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:46,109
talk through the issues and then also

339
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,690
you can do things like you can have you

340
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,009
know attorneys or land-use consultants

341
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,060
can come and present to the group and

342
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:53,159
people can ask all their different

343
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:54,299
questions because if you if it's it's

344
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:55,439
the don't know principal if you know

345
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:56,819
something you know it if you don't know

346
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,370
that you don't know it you can figure it

347
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,600
out I just messed them if you know

348
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,679
something you know it if you don't know

349
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,879
you can figure it out if you don't know

350
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,169
you don't know it you don't know what to

351
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,879
do and so somebody will ask a question

352
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:08,549
where you're like oh I didn't even know

353
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,659
that was a thing oh and then you get the

354
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,709
question answered and you're like cool

355
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:12,419
that thing I didn't even know was a

356
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,490
thing now I know the answer to it so

357
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:16,139
that that for me I think has been one of

358
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,029
the most powerful parts of the the

359
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,830
co-operative processes just being able

360
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,689
to have that dialogue and figure out

361
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,009
like oh these are the things that we're

362
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,400
all struggling with this is the

363
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:29,088
Solidarity of figuring out how to move

364
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,088
through those things

365
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:36,539
[Music]

366
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:39,059
pose another question to you so since

367
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:41,549
we've been behind the regulations and

368
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:44,579
you've got mentors now to look to on how

369
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:47,129
to structure things how do you guys see

370
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,410
working together and do you see the

371
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:52,139
possible its possibility of different

372
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:54,089
coops around the state actually working

373
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:56,370
together because as we know you know the

374
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,460
og grows different down on the coast and

375
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,720
it does over here you know it might grow

376
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,759
different in town than it does over here

377
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,350
on the ridge so how do you guys see

378
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,139
yourselves working together with other

379
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:11,659
coops to even make that that supply

380
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,659
chain even more so

381
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:19,838
you
