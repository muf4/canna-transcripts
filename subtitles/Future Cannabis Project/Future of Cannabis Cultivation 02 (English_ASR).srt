1
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,760
I'd like everyone to meet the mayor of

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,719
Avalon she's got a

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,519
question and first of all you know you

4
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,559
can all come to Catalina free on your

5
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:27,439
birthday on Catalina Express right here

6
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,960
at along Long Beach so come join

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,200
us I some of you might have heard me

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,239
yday we're on Avalon we have all the we

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,200
all have the coast guard regulations the

10
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,479
federal regulations that keep

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,399
transportation of cannabis to Catalina

12
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,919
against the law so going forward we're

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,198
really going to have to look at

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,000
cultivation local

15
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:51,000
locally um however my first question is

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,799
because 89% of our island is in a

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,159
Conservancy so they're concerned about

18
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,279
keeping everything indigenous and

19
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,319
natural even though there is some Loco

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,920
weed that does grow somewhere on the

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:06,519
island but question is when you grow

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,960
outdoors does it move with the wind and

23
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:10,719
could it go elsewhere and grow elsewhere

24
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,719
or is it because there's no seeds or

25
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,280
however you do it that's not a problem

26
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,239
that's my first

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,040
question Kyle this yeah um cannabis uh

28
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:24,078
pollen of any variety has been known to

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,200
cross oceans okay so uh yeah but uh

30
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:28,478
luckily there's something called the

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,439
species barrier so uh cannabis pollen

32
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,719
can't enter species with any of their

33
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:34,919
conserved plants or natural plants that

34
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,798
they're worried about so unless they're

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,118
unless they're cultivating cannabis out

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,159
there I don't think they have anything

37
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:42,239
to worry about okay so then my question

38
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,759
would

39
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,438
be so now it appear and maybe this is

40
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,000
something to talk individually about so

41
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,478
now truly we're going to need to

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,438
cultivate test and process and

43
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,280
everything right there on the island

44
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,158
because you can't take it back and forth

45
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,079
even to testing agencies so I guess the

46
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:03,079
question would be to someone what would

47
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:05,879
be a model and how much because the city

48
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:08,118
of avalin owns no land it's only owned

49
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,758
by a couple of different people there

50
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:11,959
one being the conservative with 89 and

51
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,559
one being the Wrigley family so I guess

52
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,000
the question is how could

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,680
we what kind of space and what are we

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,639
looking at to set up something that we

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,920
have 4200 people and a million visitors

56
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,679
a year so I'm wondering how we do the

57
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,318
calculation to figure out what our needs

58
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,239
would be and how

59
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,119
we get through this that's a lot of

60
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:34,439
metrics to go

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,120
through but um but you know what I would

62
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,519
suggest is is that you get your city

63
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,840
council to open to be extremely open to

64
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,080
the commercialization of cannabis um

65
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,479
because there's going to be a a lot of

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,480
tax revenue coming in um and B then

67
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,799
there's also the per personal the

68
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:50,399
benefits that you can reap in your own

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,480
Community by allowing these businesses

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,519
to set up so uh it's probably worth

71
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,280
forming a committee it's not that

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,120
complicated I mean you're not going to

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,439
it's like uh like the solar grid you

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,878
know you're going to grow too much weed

75
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,519
you can probably find someplace else to

76
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:05,919
pump it into um I would I would just

77
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,080
seriously suggest that the council

78
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,119
seriously embrace the commercialization

79
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,400
well well I guess my question will be

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,239
then though if some of you are out there

81
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,360
and can help figure out what this little

82
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,560
design would be that would be helpful

83
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,280
because because we don't have the

84
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,039
expertise locally of course yeah no I

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,959
would say you know if you have the data

86
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,158
on population you know you have the

87
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,878
demographics of the tourist you can make

88
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,560
some pretty good assumptions and guesses

89
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:35,158
what the production level would probably

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,799
be and then you could design around that

91
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,039
well one of the problems that they have

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,959
is there's no space so they need a

93
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,479
solution that they can grow as much as

94
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,719
possible in a tiny little space yeah I

95
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,238
definitely don't see like a 10 story

96
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,519
building being built nowal on to

97
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,599
cultivate but no that would be really

98
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,920
cool there you go a nice 10 20 story

99
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:59,438
building built out just for cultivation

100
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,438
I'm down with that you're down call me

101
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,360
what's up guys my name is Nick with

102
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:05,639
booms farm so I do living soil and

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,280
genetic consultation we've talked before

104
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,598
one of the topics is IPM integrated Pest

105
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,079
Management what's your view on crop

106
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:15,000
rotation versus the monoculture model

107
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,799
which is like corn and other food

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,199
production crop because I see cannabis

109
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,918
going that direction we do 350 acres in

110
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,800
Colorado and it's kind of we do okay

111
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,519
organically but it's becoming

112
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,439
increasingly hard for clients that are

113
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,198
having they can't use chemicals no

114
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,600
pesticides so now it's all biological

115
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,759
controls so I want to see what your

116
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,080
thoughts are on

117
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:39,160
that um I think tissue culture is a good

118
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:42,198
answer to maybe uh spraying nasty

119
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,439
fungicides and I I know you biological

120
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,520
controls only go so far but I I think

121
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:49,600
you know as we advance the tissue

122
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:51,478
culture and if if if there if it becomes

123
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,840
cost effective enough and we could put

124
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:57,639
out a really sterile crop every Harvest

125
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,638
uh or a sterile set of genetics from a

126
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,879
lab that then has you know a limited

127
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,360
exposure uh I I think that would be a

128
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,279
good start I think it's a tough tough

129
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,080
question to answer in general

130
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:15,279
though the thing is we are working with

131
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:18,680
genetic that was born in a desertic

132
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:22,758
place and on top of it most of the

133
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,560
cultiva that are used here come from the

134
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:30,120
from the Kush country like it's arid

135
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,560
montain so it's a plant that here

136
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,759
receive a

137
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:39,120
lot more water that is necessary and too

138
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,919
much food so that plant not only she has

139
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,360
problem to acclimate but you're pushing

140
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:49,079
her limit and then she become weak there

141
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,199
I have never seen PM or all the problem

142
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:55,159
you have here in any producing

143
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,639
country and those plant goes through

144
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,160
really harsher much much harsher

145
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,000
condition than here

146
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,599
so I think the solution would be to try

147
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,560
to step back a little bit and try to

148
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:14,038
work around the cultiv around the the

149
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,560
genetic more

150
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:21,839
than trying to adapt that genetic too

151
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,839
fast to to what we want her to

152
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:28,439
do yeah I agree I absolutely agree it's

153
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:30,439
you you have to uh realize that what

154
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:32,759
we're we're trying to make this plant

155
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:33,478
jump through hoops and basically because

156
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,360
of

157
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:38,318
prohibition you know so you know if you

158
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,080
weren't risking going to jail for 10

159
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,120
years you wouldn't be worrying about

160
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:46,519
getting as many grams per square inch as

161
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,240
you possibly could um so like frie if we

162
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:51,519
step back and we forget that we're not

163
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,960
looking for those helicopters overhead

164
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,799
anymore you know then we can focus a

165
00:06:53,959 --> 00:07:01,359
little more on the language of the plant

166
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,360
and just uh accommodate her a little bit

167
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,560
yes hi guys you all know me uh just a

168
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280
couple comments on on uh some of the

169
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,759
things that was said uh one was about

170
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,239
the LEDs and the

171
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,879
LEDs they have their place in growing

172
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,759
marijuana but growing flowers is a

173
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,520
little bit difficult with them they have

174
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,360
the same problem that fluorescents have

175
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,719
and that is that they're linear so they

176
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,199
don't have the penetration that a point

177
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,479
source of light has so you just don't

178
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,879
have the the depth of canopy that you do

179
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:35,399
with your uh hpss or whatever I was

180
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,840
going to say that David earlier I didn't

181
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:39,198
think that they can they I don't I don't

182
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,439
think they can create a high-intensity

183
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,919
LED simply because of the way it's made

184
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,199
it would be too damn hot they would burn

185
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:48,519
up right but on the other hand I've

186
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,960
grown with LEDs but I've used them uh to

187
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:54,560
produce small uh quite small uh seed

188
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,878
crops in a closet uh one of the benefits

189
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,598
of course they don't produce the heat

190
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,080
because they're more efficient you know

191
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,560
making light rather than Heat the other

192
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,519
thing is

193
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,038
that and this is something that

194
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:09,079
particularly grates me there is no such

195
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:12,158
thing as kaix to Lea racio all right

196
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:15,198
there is none it's bra to Leaf ratio CU

197
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:17,879
nobody in this room has ever seen a

198
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,280
female cix because it doesn't exist

199
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:24,520
official Smackdown by B Frank accepted

200
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:27,279
all right just to explain this very

201
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,560
quickly if you take a seed you'll notice

202
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,519
that it has spots usually or something

203
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,278
sort of camouflage on it if you look

204
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,199
really closely you'll notice that that's

205
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,479
contained in a translucent Veil that

206
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,839
covers about 60 to 90% of the seed and

207
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,680
you can rub those spots right off the

208
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:48,200
seed uh well within that Veil there are

209
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:51,199
presumptive cells that would become a

210
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,959
kaix if it ever evolved in cannabis

211
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,000
there are also cells that would produce

212
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:59,919
a the Corolla if it evolved now the

213
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,679
Corolla for you that don't know are like

214
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,319
the Fancy Petals you see on flowers you

215
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:07,919
would buy uh the KX would be the little

216
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:12,200
brown cup that's holding those uh those

217
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:15,479
uh petals uh well those evolve to

218
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,360
attract pollinators animals insects that

219
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,560
sort of thing cannabis is wind

220
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,039
pollinated it never had an incentive for

221
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:26,119
those cells to develop into anything and

222
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:30,838
so they remain just a few cells within

223
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:33,200
uh this thin veil and this Kix to to

224
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,760
Leaf de KX ratio has bugged me for so

225
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,800
long I can't tell you because it's so

226
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,200
much apart I am so glad I gave you an

227
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,319
opportunity to speak out the other one

228
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,399
is that they call the two hairs that

229
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,360
stick up that are the pollen catches

230
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,919
they call them pistols and those are

231
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:54,120
Stig SAS there's only one pistol per

232
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:56,879
flower and the pistol is the entire uh

233
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,600
sexual organ of the plant which is just

234
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,600
those two stigmas and little oval inside

235
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,240
that will become a seed of his poed

236
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,240
that's all I have to say than

237
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,519
question away from the speaker that was

238
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,759
an amazing educational moment

239
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,240
there so if we're looking at the future

240
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,519
of cultivation can we just talk a little

241
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,159
bit more about uh energy use because it

242
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,320
is not a very green um situation Oregon

243
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:26,759
right now has a new standard coming up

244
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,000
called clean green it's their

245
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,958
alternative to organic because frankly

246
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,159
if you have a bunch of pesticide

247
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,518
regulations well if you use organic soil

248
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:37,639
you'll be triggering those um pretty

249
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,560
pretty regularly so in California

250
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,600
specifically and indoor specifically

251
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:46,239
even more the energy grid

252
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,720
wow yeah I go I just just I once heard I

253
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,399
once heard that uh 2% of all the

254
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,079
electricity generated in California goes

255
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,360
to cannabis

256
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:58,919
production so I don't know if that's low

257
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:03,039
or high or if it's even correct I I I

258
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:03,039
just I'm qualifying that I

259
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,320
just we've got we've we've got Betty ye

260
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:17,039
in the audience do you know the number

261
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:20,839
no okay Rec stud that came out 2014 %

262
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,838
of% of all United

263
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,039
States okay so now I can't have

264
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,720
hamburgers because of cow farts and I

265
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,838
can't smoke my marijuana because it's

266
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,399
coal no I'm just you know I I'm using

267
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,480
humor it's it's a it's a very valid

268
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,559
point and we have to become cleaner if

269
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,079
not through

270
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:41,479
LEDs

271
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:43,278
um I mean I can't solve the energy

272
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,600
crisis I don't have any great ideas Mel

273
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,559
Frank do you have any great ideas about

274
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,240
the energy

275
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,239
crisis well come on up

276
00:11:52,839 --> 00:12:01,480
here you know I okay I've listened to uh

277
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,039
uh some of the PBS on uh prop 64 and one

278
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,639
you get people there who have one aspect

279
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,039
of of growing like one of the issues is

280
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:11,200
the amount of electricity that's being

281
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:14,599
used and I've seen two studies one was

282
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,278
1% one was 3% but in any event they're

283
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,560
looking at this the wrong way because

284
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:22,240
they're looking at it as it exists now

285
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,638
with all these underground hidden indor

286
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,519
grows and there are not going to be that

287
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,519
many of them all right they're going to

288
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,078
start to disappear because people can

289
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:34,078
come out and natural light so they're

290
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:36,439
using the the the wrong uh data to try

291
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,319
to project at what it's going to be it's

292
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,920
going to be much less than than they

293
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,920
think it really is

294
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,559
yes very

295
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,958
good all how you doing uh question

296
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,799
relating to LEDs what do you guys think

297
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,439
of

298
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:56,278
lec's I I don't have much experience

299
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,959
with lec's yet so I can't really comment

300
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:00,519
on LEC I don't even know what it is can

301
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:03,039
somebody please educate me

302
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:05,078
it's like a Ceramics oh okay I didn't

303
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:08,319
know they were called lec's I just knew

304
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:10,759
they were called Ceramics yeah yeah I I

305
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,800
we have we've done actually Mel has done

306
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,600
some testing with LC's recently I think

307
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,519
he could probably comment on it but me

308
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,159
personally no I don't have any data on

309
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,639
the lec's versus MHS or

310
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,198
LEDs I don't either other than just some

311
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,000
anecdotal from people who have told me

312
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:29,240
that it Veges really well but it doesn't

313
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,919
flower very well

314
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:36,120
time really no I I the for people who

315
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:39,039
don't know they're called ceramic bulbs

316
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,799
and uh they're generally right now

317
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:44,159
generating are using 3155 Watts the par

318
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,838
value out of there in other words the

319
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:50,679
usable light by the plant is is very

320
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:53,160
high uh in fact I've seen one of these

321
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:56,479
315 not one actually I've seen many of

322
00:13:53,159 --> 00:14:00,000
them but one single 3155 watt light over

323
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,039
a 4x8 standard tray uh be ble to veg out

324
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,240
the entire tray which was amazing

325
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,919
because when you would look at both ends

326
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,159
of that tray they seem appear to be

327
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:11,479
almost in the dark and yet we got great

328
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:13,559
growth across the entire thing so I

329
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,440
think now the ones that people who were

330
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:18,399
selling them are talking about having

331
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,800
six of these per 4x8 tray and of course

332
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,679
you would have amazing growth but just

333
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,399
from what I've seen so far and I haven't

334
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:28,319
done it with full flowering yet is I

335
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:31,799
think three or four which would cut your

336
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,879
electrical use from standard uh uh HPS

337
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:37,758
is where you would use two 1,000 wat for

338
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:39,240
a 4x8 tray uh by almost a half and these

339
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,320
are also some of the things that going

340
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,959
to change the amount of electricity

341
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,879
that's used as more efficient ways of

342
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:49,000
using the energy that that you need to

343
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,639
grow these plants and the ceramic bulbs

344
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,639
I think are one of

345
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,958
those any other

346
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,480
questions no we're good okay thank you

347

348
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,360
