1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,068
so breaking dabs on instagram is a he's

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:11,730
really when the short path distillation

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:15,690
new game came up he put a lot of energy

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,269
into just figuring out all the the

5
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:21,089
variables and how to make great oil and

6
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:23,460
and increase throughputs and writing it

7
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:25,589
all down yes is so huge in this industry

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,250
for people to like write it down create

9
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:31,589
a a very specific SOP and then so people

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,109
can duplicate that work exactly like

11
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:39,380
that then it's and verify the results

12
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:39,379
you know so if it comes a standard yes

13
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:45,209
he's a consultant that that was very

14
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:47,609
very generous and everything that he's

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,429
put online eventually it right now he's

16
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:53,719
worked towards you know commoditizing

17
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:57,000
ism in some way but great yeah but and

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,939
but I don't know anybody that runs a

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,579
short path that doesn't you know tip

20
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:12,989
their hat to what he what he did for the

21
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:16,739
industry and and another another yes

22
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:19,908
that his hot condenser tech the breaking

23
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:22,349
dabs hot condenser tech was absolutely a

24
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:24,000
ground breaker for the distillation of

25
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:29,089
cannabinoids because people started

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,150
realizing that they started selectively

27
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:38,009
selectively condensing things before it

28
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,630
was all you vaporize vaporize their

29
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,569
cannabinoids and everything that comes

30
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,938
up you condense it all and then you just

31
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:48,839
you don't want anything to bypass and

32
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:51,209
end up in your trash so he was the one

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,680
that realized that there will be things

34
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:56,259
that code is still and

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,450
that there's ways of increasing your

36
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:02,560
condenser temperatures to let them

37
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,780
bypass your the drop down for your your

38
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,609
oil and they'll continue as a vapor and

39
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,939
then they'll get deposited further down

40
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:12,789
your path yeah but not in your flask for

41
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:14,169
targeted soil so basically in

42
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:15,729
distillation if I could just like cut

43
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:17,589
this down a laser this is out to do

44
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:20,079
basically a distillation you have a

45
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,050
boiling flash you pour your your crude

46
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,940
oil into this boiling flask and as it

47
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,870
gets to specific temperatures it

48
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:30,879
fractions off by vaporizing different

49
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,610
compounds inside that boiling class so

50
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,400
there's THC CBD all your cannabinoids

51
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,020
all your terpenes depending on their

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,120
specific boiling point is when they

53
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,020
would fraction off of that main body of

54
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,900
oil

55
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:49,209
so what breaking dabs did was most

56
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,670
people just had a cold fluid running

57
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:54,159
through their condenser so once that hot

58
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:55,988
oil vapor would hit the condenser it

59
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,069
would this is just so for people who

60
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,259
don't know this stuff I just want to

61
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,780
like give them this this short story hit

62
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:03,429
that condenser and it would cool it to a

63
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,870
point where it would Reece elyda fie

64
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:09,730
right and then and then it would it

65
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,280
would land on a there was a flask that

66
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:14,679
would come off of that path and this is

67
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,799
all done under very deep vacuum right

68
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:22,330
but you for cannabinoids specifically

69
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:24,670
correct me if I'm wrong they don't they

70
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,830
don't need to be so cold to read that

71
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:29,018
they're volatile in the sense they want

72
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,280
to go back their natural state is oil so

73
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,980
you don't have to bring the temperature

74
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,080
up or down so you've got a really low

75
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:38,009
vapor pressure very low vapor pressure

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,930
is the better term for it

77
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:44,259
so this hot condenser tech allowed you

78
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,890
to pass more garbage and just really

79
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:48,548
collect

80
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:51,509
a very much cleaner cannabinoid fraction

81
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:51,510
into your collection flask

82
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,259
and what you're collecting versus being

83
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:59,930
like in a catch-all or correct that

84
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:02,000
totally solidifies between a certain

85
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,580
code code Castillo's

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,439
like this oh yeah so like selectively

87
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:13,370
Rican dancing was something that people

88
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,530
started it that it it jogged something

89
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:18,728
in a lot of people's my brains and got

90
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,728
them thinking on another level
