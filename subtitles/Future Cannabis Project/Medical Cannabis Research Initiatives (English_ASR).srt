2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:25,010
[Music]

3
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,560
everybody in this audience probably is

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:31,359
hurt that research we need more research

5
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:34,429
about the medical uses of cannabis but

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,840
most other folks that aren't involved in

7
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:38,719
doing medical cannabis research don't

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,330
understand the unique challenges that

9
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,609
exist to try to get this research done

10
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:46,039
and so today I'm really delighted to be

11
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:47,960
here to moderate a panel that has some

12
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,018
real heavy hitters in the cannabis

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,780
research space and they represent both

14
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:54,619
sort of academic and non-academic

15
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,808
research so I think we've got a nice

16
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:58,728
breadth of experience to really get at

17
00:00:56,808 --> 00:01:01,609
the issues of you know what are the

18
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:04,370
things that are inhibiting our progress

19
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:06,049
towards that that epiphany when we have

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,109
enough cannabis research so to for

21
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:10,460
example reschedule or other interesting

22
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:12,469
things that could could happen when we

23
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:16,219
get that magic amount of research that

24
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:17,989
we need so without further ado what I'm

25
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:21,078
gonna do is this is the structure for

26
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:23,060
today we're going to have each of our

27
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:26,508
panelists do a brief self-introduction

28
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:29,000
and then our first question will be sort

29
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:31,069
of open-ended and it will be from your

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,310
experience what have been the

31
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:37,250
opportunities and challenges in studying

32
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,899
medical cannabis and lastly we're going

33
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,920
to touch just a little bit on a federal

34
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:45,259
level policy which is the medical

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,460
cannabis research act of 2018 there's

36
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:48,049
some folks on the panel who have some

37
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:50,538
things that they'd like to sort of bring

38
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:53,689
forward on that hi guys I'm sue Sisley

39
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:56,659
I'm of internal medicine physician from

40
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:59,089
Arizona I'm the president of Scottsdale

41
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:01,069
Research Institute were focused

42
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,740
primarily on doing controlled trials

43
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:07,100
looking at Flour both smoked and

44
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:09,409
vaporize flour for you know trying to

45
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:11,629
put flour through the entire FDA drug

46
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:13,579
development process so we're best known

47
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:15,889
for this study you've probably heard

48
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,660
about the FDA phase 2 trial looking at

49
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:22,279
cannabis for treating veterans with PTSD

50
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:24,408
but we also have others study we're

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,030
doing a clinical trial with University

52
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:27,419
of Michigan looking at cannabis for

53
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,300
chronic pain

54
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:32,219
we have another study looking at we just

55
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,460
finished a safety study on cannabis

56
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,500
edibles and we're also building a

57
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,750
national patient registry which I'm

58
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,650
hoping to talk about later a canvas

59
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,629
patient registry very in-depth national

60
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:50,330
database collecting information about

61
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:53,310
how patients are reacting to cannabis

62
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,690
hello my name is Daniel O'Malley I'm a

63
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,319
professor at University of California

64
00:02:54,689 --> 00:03:01,289
Irvine I have been studying cannabinoids

65
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,379
and endocannabinoids for the last 25

66
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:06,959
years more or less and currently I am

67
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:10,079
the director along with Professor Bob

68
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:14,210
Solomon in the School of Law of the UCI

69
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:18,260
Center for the Study of cannabis that

70
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:21,750
just created its a its mission is to

71
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:23,819
understand the challenges and possibly

72
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,289
provide solutions also for the

73
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,629
challenges there lying ahead of us now

74
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:31,879
that cannabis is being legalized

75
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,879
throughout the throughout the country

76
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:38,750
i'm magalie Holmes I'm the CEO of

77
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:41,729
Philo's bioscience or a cannabis

78
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:45,599
genomics and plant breeding company

79
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,979
based in Portland Oregon and so I unlike

80
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,189
I think everybody else here on the panel

81
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:53,639
who is generally focused on the medical

82
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:56,490
side of the research issue everything we

83
00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:00,239
do is focused on the plant side and it

84
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:03,270
actually turns out that it's it's even

85
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,040
harder to get plant research done in the

86
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,130
United States especially in universities

87
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:11,179
than it is to get medical research done

88
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:15,269
so I was also the chair last year of the

89
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:18,420
the governor's cannabis research task

90
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:21,600
force in Oregon where we were charged

91
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,069
with putting together a road map for how

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,420
to how the state of Oregon could get

93
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:30,899
research done on cannabis and our

94
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:34,110
findings were that there was basically

95
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:35,759
no way at the time for Oregon

96
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,949
universities to do the kind of research

97
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,678
that we wanted to do and things are

98
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:43,829
starting to loosen up a little bit

99
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:46,739
especially here in the UC system where

100
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:49,678
people are more aggressive than they are

101
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:53,249
in in other states um but it is still

102
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:58,109
very difficult to get any of this

103
00:04:53,249 --> 00:05:00,179
research done and especially when it

104
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,149
comes to linking actual plants and what

105
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:06,198
we know about the plants to medical

106
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:09,569
outcomes so that's what we're focused on

107
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:12,300
I'm Tom market I'm a professor of

108
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:14,369
psychiatry at UC San Diego and also the

109
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,588
co-director of the UC Center for

110
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:19,050
medicinal cannabis research I'm a

111
00:05:16,588 --> 00:05:20,879
neuropsychologist by training just

112
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,490
briefly the CM CR has been around since

113
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:28,199
2000 so following the Compassionate Use

114
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:30,860
Act passage the Senate the California

115
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,119
Legislature put aside money to look at

116
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,098
potential medical benefits of cannabis

117
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:38,209
so we conducted seven clinical trials

118
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:40,709
Pathak pain chemist related spasticity

119
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:43,559
ended up having positive findings in all

120
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:45,180
of those studies back in the 2000s this

121
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:48,779
was primarily smoked cannabis or

122
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,879
vaporize and also THC only currently our

123
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:53,579
Center has for clinical trials either

124
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,169
running or getting ready to start so we

125
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,300
have a take home study looking at low

126
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:59,908
back pain this is an eight-week study

127
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,028
we're starting up studies looking at CBD

128
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:04,978
for severe autism looking at early

129
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:07,468
psychosis as well as essential tremor

130
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:09,088
and also have some observational

131
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:12,538
mechanistic studies looking at bipolar

132
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:14,699
disorder and HIV neuropathic pain the

133
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,528
other aspect RCM terrorism is Public

134
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,718
Safety and so I'm the PI of a study

135
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:22,579
looking at cannabis and driving and how

136
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:22,579
to accurately detect impairment or not

137
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:28,259
so we've been fairly successful in this

138
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,329
sort of era we have some funding from

139
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,459
NIH some from the state some from

140
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:34,199
private foundations and are using

141
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:37,019
product from NIDA the University of

142
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,028
Mississippi as well as synthetic CBD

143
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:41,160
from incest as you may have heard also

144
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:44,339
plant drive from

145
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,990
that was just announced that's me as you

146
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:50,459
all know we are really blessed to have

147
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:52,829
such a depth and breadth of expertise on

148
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:54,448
this panel and without further ado I

149
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,459
want to launch into sort of the primary

150
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:59,310
question that the panelists have been

151
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:01,579
asked to address which is what have been

152
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,589
the challenges and opportunities of

153
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:06,959
working in medical cannabis research and

154
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:09,000
I wanted to sort of jump in and give my

155
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,508
own sort of take on that to sort of kick

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,550
it off so back like like many people I

157
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,229
was introduced to cannabis in college

158
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,509
although what I'm really talking about

159
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:20,250
is about that time I was I was in

160
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:24,629
college the endocannabinoid system was

161
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:27,870
being discovered by folks like Daniele

162
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:30,389
and it really inspired me to want to go

163
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,069
do that work so as my first postdoc I

164
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:34,889
was working at the Queen's Center for

165
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:37,680
biomedical engineering in Honolulu

166
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:39,629
Hawaii in a Schedule one facility and we

167
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,728
were trying to do research on the

168
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:44,189
effects of cannabis on the immune system

169
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:46,829
and what I found out really quickly was

170
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,779
that it was really hard to get product

171
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:50,519
and it was really hard to get funding to

172
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,109
do this work nevertheless we did some

173
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,839
studies and it was a great period of

174
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,788
time in my life but I personally went

175
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:01,098
off and did some work in biotech sphere

176
00:07:56,788 --> 00:08:05,158
where I've in my past I have done some

177
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:07,259
work as in R&amp;D and in quality and

178
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:09,778
manufacturing of pharmaceuticals but

179
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,550
then I came back to the industry right

180
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:13,019
now because it seems like there are some

181
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,960
opportunities that exist within the

182
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,639
state regulated programs so I I my new

183
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,348
experience in doing research is in the

184
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,810
context of working with GP sciences and

185
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:24,418
we have we hold licenses and stay in

186
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,939
both Nevada as well as we are working

187
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:29,189
with LSU AG center to be one of two

188
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,110
providers of all the the cannabis

189
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,849
products to the state of Louisiana and

190
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,959
so through these we have some

191
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:36,570
interesting opportunities for doing

192
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,788
research on plant genetics on things

193
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,070
like we've been doing a lot of work on

194
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:43,468
in vitro propagation techniques to

195
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,680
ensure the genetic fidelity of our lives

196
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:49,230
as well as doing chemo fire profiling so

197
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,969
been a really exciting time we also done

198
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,560
a lot of work to try to standardize and

199
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,480
we've done some basic science work to

200
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,069
try to link profiles to

201
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,620
specific disease indications we've filed

202
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,600
six patents and our lead our lead

203
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,028
compound is for the treatment of

204
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,709
Parkinson's and we were getting really

205
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:07,289
excited because we're getting close to

206
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:09,838
having enough data to try to file an

207
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:11,610
exploratory IND in this area but we hit

208
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,889
a snag which was even though we had

209
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,379
standardized or compounds at our

210
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:18,600
facility in Nevada to what I would

211
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:20,370
consider a GMP standard because of sole

212
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,019
source we couldn't use her own compounds

213
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,339
so we've had to source them overseas

214
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:28,500
we've had to use a contract manufacturer

215
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:31,170
farm it's Catalan Pharma is going to be

216
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,539
doing our prototype formulations and the

217
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:35,490
process is super super complicated

218
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,078
whereas if any other kind of drug

219
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,370
development we were doing we wouldn't

220
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:40,469
have to go through these mash Nations

221
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,750
just to get the compounds in the order

222
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,750
and get them into a trial so with that

223
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,190
I'd like to invite say sue to contrast

224
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,009
compare and contrast it with your

225
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:52,350
experience we're focused on flour so

226
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:54,689
we've had a real challenge dealing with

227
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,990
the DEA night of Monopoly many of you

228
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:01,110
know that the National Institute on Drug

229
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:03,269
Abuse has enjoy you know through

230
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,889
University of Mississippi licensing

231
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,799
they've enjoyed a government enforcement

232
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:10,470
aa police since 1968 on the only

233
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:13,198
federally legal supply of cannabis for

234
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,829
controlled trials so even what Andre

235
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:19,740
mentioned about growing cannabis in

236
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:21,958
Louisiana is still wouldn't be usable

237
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,778
for any controlled trial she can grow

238
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,849
the best you know most diverse team of

239
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:28,470
ours in the universe and none of them

240
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,600
will be allowed to be used for any

241
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,639
control trust which really is the only

242
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,680
thing that matters to the medical

243
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,049
community right we only care about

244
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,629
randomized controlled trials and that's

245
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:42,198
generally what what gets published in

246
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:45,448
peer-reviewed journals so until we have

247
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:47,639
diverse you know until University of

248
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:51,149
Mississippi is ever allowed to access

249
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:53,339
diverse genetics we're stuck with these

250
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:55,500
you know this really low-quality plant

251
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:58,380
material without any access to any

252
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,230
unique cannabinoids except batches of

253
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:04,500
THC and CBD and that's all we know about

254
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,990
it and so if you dare ask for any unique

255
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,220
team of ours that are that are widely

256
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,320
available throughout

257
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,720
the regulated markets you can't get it

258
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,280
and that's I'm not criticizing

259
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,040
University Mississippi I'm just saying

260
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:19,139
that this monopoly needs to end we've

261
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,389
been striving to start a national

262
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,939
conversation for the last decade about

263
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:26,039
the problems with this month the fact

264
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,630
that they they need to license other

265
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,319
growers for research

266
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:33,269
the DEA pledged to the public back in

267
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,100
2016 that they would finally end the

268
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:37,710
monopoly and license other growers they

269
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,480
haven't moved forward on that at all

270
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,700
there's over you know twenty six

271
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,399
applications that have been sitting on

272
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,620
the desk of the DEA for two years none

273
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,159
of them have been processed and in the

274
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,690
meantime you know we could be enjoying a

275
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:53,579
renaissance of cannabis research in this

276
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,890
country if we were allowing other

277
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,290
private growers to provide you know we

278
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:00,389
have all these expert growers here in

279
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:03,179
this conference who could easily be

280
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:05,610
providing important team of ours for our

281
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,679
studies and they're not allowed to and I

282
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:11,250
think we all need as taxpayers we need

283
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:13,469
to demand that the DEA move forward and

284
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,419
license other growers and I think Tom

285
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,570
can speak to the fact that what he just

286
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:19,319
mentioned about the the the notion that

287
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:23,280
tilray

288
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:26,550
a Canadian LP is now allowed to export

289
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,500
study drug into the US but yet we're not

290
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:30,779
allowed to any of our expert our

291
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,090
talented farmers are not allowed to

292
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:36,600
provide medicine for these studies is

293
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:39,210
just an abomination my friends my

294
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,800
colleagues at University ask me why do

295
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:48,480
you do this because I tell them what we

296
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:52,199
have to go through to just run an animal

297
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,550
study or an in vitro cellular study with

298
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,420
cannot be no it's plenty ripe

299
00:12:53,549 --> 00:13:02,609
cannabinoids and if I walk them through

300
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:07,909
the process they look at me then their

301
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:12,539
mouths open and their jaws drop and

302
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:17,459
their eyes roll said why are you wasting

303
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:19,319
your time on this you all know what I am

304
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,610
talking about what you all know what I'm

305
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,820
wasting my time

306
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,919
I'm wasting my time I'm getting a

307
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:30,870
Schedule one license which means that a

308
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:33,990
certain number of things have to be done

309
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:37,528
before during and after due process just

310
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:40,289
in order for us to start collecting

311
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:42,600
preliminary results to write a grant

312
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:45,629
proposal which then will require another

313
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:49,889
year year and a half two years to be

314
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:53,879
funded am i saying that this is

315
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:58,049
impossible no I'm here and we have doing

316
00:13:53,879 --> 00:14:00,389
this we just got a very large nine

317
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:02,429
million dollar grant to study the impact

318
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:05,278
of cannabinoids on adolescence so it is

319
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:08,338
possible but so much of that energy

320
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:11,909
could have gone to science as opposed to

321
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:15,839
bureaucracy to science as opposed to

322
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:17,909
useless red tape and so many of the

323
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,769
questions that we would like to ask are

324
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:27,319
just not askable we cannot ask them very

325
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:30,089
recently we were on the phone with Tom

326
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:34,019
Marquardt and now a colleague of ours

327
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:37,050
from UC Davis who is an agronomist is a

328
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:41,370
plant biologist so I don't want to steal

329
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:43,109
our thunder but he already when Michael

330
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:46,470
already alluded to the difficulty of

331
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:49,230
doing plant biology with we cannabis in

332
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:54,720
the context in the present legislative

333
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:56,490
context this person a UC Davis a very

334
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,480
experienced plasma plant biologist had

335
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:04,169
never done any work on cannabis so when

336
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:06,000
Tom and I introduced him to the steps I

337
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,769
had to be taken you know I think at one

338
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,169
point we were considering seriously Tom

339
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:12,149
whether it was worth the effort say and

340
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:15,838
you know say like well no no let's do it

341
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:17,879
let's still do it so eventually these

342
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,760
scientists we were able to I think to

343
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:24,088
persuade him that it was really worth

344
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,338
the effort because you know literally

345
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:30,110
the idea of having to grow cannabis at

346
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:33,089
UC Davis in the present context was so

347
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,050
so hard for a scientist who is busy now

348
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:35,519
you could have

349
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:39,659
even I also see it from this perspective

350
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,649
we are not in a for-profit start

351
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:44,909
structure like my two esteemed panelists

352
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:47,909
nonprofit or profit but you know you're

353
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:49,708
dedicated to to the study of cannabis we

354
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:51,659
can do other things and that's why my

355
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,979
colleagues my friends asked me why

356
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,649
you're doing it let me say just a few

357
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,869
words why I am doing this because it's

358
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,999
good to see the challenges but it's also

359
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:04,079
important to understand that these

360
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:07,139
challenges are worth overcoming because

361
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:12,149
what we have here I think is a

362
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:14,808
phenomenal opportunity I would say a

363
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:18,269
historical opportunity if it wasn't an

364
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:20,938
abused term but it is in a sense

365
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:24,600
historical because not so many times in

366
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:27,419
the life of a person or a country there

367
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:32,069
is the situation we have now where an

368
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:37,528
entire host of chemicals produced by a

369
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:40,860
plant have been closed to research into

370
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:47,278
perusal by scientist and by to use by

371
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:49,649
clinical investigators for almost a

372
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:52,860
hundred years and all of a sudden this

373
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:56,399
is opening slowly but surely because

374
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,259
that's the trend this is opening and we

375
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,009
don't even know the questions that we

376
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:04,318
need to ask that's I think that is the

377
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:07,019
amazingly interesting think about this

378
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,879
is that we are opening a new window on

379
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:12,480
the brain and the body we discovered the

380
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,459
endogenous cannabinoids system we we

381
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,828
have the opportunity of creating in new

382
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:19,528
classes of analgesics that could be if

383
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:21,388
not replacing certainly complementing

384
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:24,500
the operates which are causing an

385
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:27,750
epidemics that is destroying our country

386
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:30,630
we could be opening a window on new

387
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,359
cheers for new diseases like no new

388
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:37,500
cures for all diseases like autism like

389
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:40,619
forms of epilepsy and all this I think

390
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,690
you know because this brand and its

391
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:45,919
components and what it means for science

392
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:50,090
have been actually closed

393
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:52,850
to research for since 1937 you know

394
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:56,509
since the enactment of the marijuana Tax

395
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:59,059
Act under the FDR administration so this

396
00:17:56,509 --> 00:18:01,190
is why I think we as scientists are so

397
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:03,500
excited about this I know I know Thomas

398
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,420
I know I am the rest the other panelists

399
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,750
I also believe are just like I am and

400
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:12,050
that's why I think we we can put up with

401
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:15,109
this BS because it's really if you think

402
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:18,319
about it's really BS it is BS and I'll

403
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:21,019
tell you why I tell you why because if

404
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:23,659
as a scientist I want to do research on

405
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:26,960
cannabis I have to go through all these

406
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,820
hoops but in an federally funded

407
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,410
institution in a public institution or a

408
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:32,210
private institution it receives funds

409
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,490
from the federal government this is what

410
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:37,090
I have to do everybody else doesn't I

411
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:40,160
mean you have issues cultivating I

412
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:43,039
understand that you have issues passing

413
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:47,930
the state borders I understand that but

414
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,430
if I was in a private lab in Irvine

415
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,380
California instead of being at

416
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:53,060
University of California Irvine and I

417
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,700
wanted to do any type of research on

418
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:58,279
cannabis I could if I had my own funding

419
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,799
I could so now why is that a problem it

420
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:03,490
is a problem to me because I believe

421
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:06,169
that the fact that the vast majority of

422
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:08,180
scientists in this country who are

423
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:13,430
funded at the federal government by the

424
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:16,779
NIH NSF etc cannot take a look at this

425
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:19,549
plant means that somebody else will and

426
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:22,750
those who will be looking and not

427
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:26,480
necessarily the people that we want to

428
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:31,210
be looking at this problem because they

429
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:33,980
come to the question with an agenda and

430
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:36,140
we shouldn't have that agenda we should

431
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:40,039
have no agenda our only agenda should be

432
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,140
get the data understand what's happening

433
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:46,190
well I could probably go on for another

434
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:48,410
hour so I better stop so after we had

435
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,440
this research task force in Oregon and

436
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:56,660
we know we're trying to ask the question

437
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,860
how can researchers medical researchers

438
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,048
who generally exist

439
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:06,119
at federally funded universities how can

440
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:09,230
they do studies that with human subjects

441
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:12,869
that actually use the cannabis that is

442
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:14,250
available to people instead of isolated

443
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:18,389
cannabinoids which we know act

444
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:21,450
differently or the terrible terrible

445
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:26,970
weed that has grown at University of

446
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:29,460
Mississippi and there really is no

447
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,500
concrete wait so many researchers are

448
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,660
getting really creative you know they

449
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,298
they're doing observational studies

450
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,240
they're pushing the limits of how much

451
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:41,819
they can suggest to their subjects of

452
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,490
the observational studies what kind of

453
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:46,769
products they should buy and there's a

454
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,509
group in Colorado that is getting people

455
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:49,740
high in a van outside the University

456
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:51,808
before they bring them in and put them

457
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,789
in the brain scanner but they have to do

458
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:56,129
it on the street there's some people are

459
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:58,470
getting very creative but in general

460
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:02,220
there's no way to get people the actual

461
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:07,620
plant that they're gonna be exposed to

462
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:10,079
and so what we realized is that we you

463
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:11,459
know we could get all that if we wanted

464
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:16,129
to do to plant work we could get it done

465
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:18,900
more effectively in a company where we

466
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:21,120
just don't face all those restraints and

467
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,490
also because you know we're not working

468
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:27,719
directly with human subjects we don't

469
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:29,250
face the incredible array of some of

470
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,660
them very reasonable restraints that the

471
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,269
federal government puts on how you do

472
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,390
human subjects research

473
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:37,918
but our job is to figure out how to

474
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,200
understand the plant and feed the plant

475
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,600
into those medical research pathways how

476
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,580
to make plants that have high levels of

477
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:46,589
these other cannabinoids that we want to

478
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:50,089
study and how to characterize the plants

479
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:53,220
in a way that makes the studies data

480
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:55,709
understandable so for instance we're

481
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,179
working with a group at that the Oregon

482
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,850
Health and Science University now that's

483
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,410
trying to do a controlled a semi

484
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:02,909
controlled observational study where

485
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,970
they know what varieties people are

486
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:08,759
taking they can't administer themselves

487
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,470
that the plant themselves but they they

488
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:12,589
want to know what people are taking but

489
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,710
as you guys know no one knows

490
00:22:12,589 --> 00:22:17,899
what anything is there's thousands of

491
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,210
different varieties so we're genetically

492
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,528
testing the varieties to try to feed

493
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,909
those in the studies so that the

494
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:25,099
researchers can know that at least

495
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:28,130
everyone's getting the same genetically

496
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:32,629
identical plant so there are all those

497
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:36,909
problems to solve and one thing I just I

498
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:36,909
want people to be clear about is that

499
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:42,038
there's this whole raft of terrible

500
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,960
regulatory problems but that's not

501
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:46,369
that's only half of it the other problem

502
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,960
is that we're actually just dealing

503
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:49,398
scientifically with an incredibly

504
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,220
complicated subject

505
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:53,869
so the endocannabinoid system is really

506
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,990
really complex there are many receptors

507
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:58,668
that do many many things and then on the

508
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,470
plant side there are thousands and

509
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:04,309
thousands of different kinds of cannabis

510
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:06,769
and they have you know perhaps dozens of

511
00:23:04,308 --> 00:23:09,710
active or potentially active molecules

512
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:11,808
at different ratios in each plant and so

513
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,850
it's just combinatorially a hard

514
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:16,519
scientific question to do control

515
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:18,139
studies with anyway and when you merge

516
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:21,980
that with the regulatory problems it

517
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:23,960
it's really difficult but I think it's

518
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,788
important for the industry to know I

519
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:31,009
mean a lot of you out there people who

520
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:34,069
are trying to make products and you're

521
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:36,200
making them without much knowledge you

522
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:37,939
know like right now there's this new

523
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,759
wave of people trying to make products

524
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,110
that have THC V in them because we think

525
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:44,298
that's awesome

526
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:46,969
we have hints we have a friend who

527
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:51,619
smoked it it was amazing but we don't

528
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:53,028
know right and we just don't know what's

529
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:55,099
gonna happen once we actually get data

530
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:56,390
about that cannabinoid and maybe it

531
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:58,639
works or maybe it doesn't it maybe it

532
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,259
only works if you also have this much

533
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,059
limonene and this much beta care you

534
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:03,980
finally mixed in in the same dose and we

535
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:05,869
just don't know and we're not going to

536
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,849
know for a while but the industry is

537
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:10,428
going to be reliant on researchers

538
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:13,189
figuring all this stuff out you know in

539
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:15,590
a big way it's the project of the

540
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:18,409
cannabis industry to map all the

541
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:19,939
complicated universe of cannabis

542
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:22,549
varieties and all the compounds in there

543
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,100
and all the combinations to map that

544
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:28,099
complexity to the complexity of human

545
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:32,079
reactions and human medical conditions

546
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:35,359
and we are so far from doing that and

547
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:39,678
the industry is so far out ahead of us

548
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:44,058
making stuff and trying it that one

549
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,440
whole other source of research data is

550
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:46,908
going to be from the industry and we

551
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,490
have this kind of unprecedented

552
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:52,580
opportunity to pull in big data from the

553
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:55,870
industry which is being allowed to give

554
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:58,699
people stuff and if we can find ways to

555
00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:00,798
pull in that information for instance

556
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,960
the kind of study that Sue is doing

557
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:06,859
which is trying to set up this network

558
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,210
of patient data pulling in data like

559
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:09,349
that from people who are using all the

560
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,038
products out there on the industry

561
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:14,599
that's not a controlled study but

562
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:16,730
there's a new world of big data where we

563
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:19,278
can pull in so much data and it can be

564
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,860
messy and dirty but if it's big enough

565
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:25,069
we can we can tease out what matters and

566
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:27,638
feed that back in so so that's the other

567
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:29,928
thing that I just want to say is that

568
00:25:27,638 --> 00:25:31,428
doing this research is really difficult

569
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:33,519
and we need the industry to care about

570
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:36,440
it and we need the industry to help

571
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:40,069
because you guys actually are in a

572
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,590
position regardless of what we think

573
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:44,599
about the the night of cannabis at least

574
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:47,028
in our studies many years ago we did see

575
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:49,689
a positive effect so it's not saying our

576
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:51,409
better strains etc but still even

577
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,480
whatever you think of the night of

578
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:55,759
cannabis we still saw th the effects on

579
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,319
I'm really difficult to treat conditions

580
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,970
since you just said that can I had one

581
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:00,528
thing so we just tested it genetically

582
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,409
we got a sample from one of the

583
00:26:00,528 --> 00:26:13,009
remaining patients and we we sequenced

584
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:14,269
it and it um it is 96% skunk skunk it's

585
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:16,038
straight skunk and we talked to David

586
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:18,019
Watson who was the creator of skunk and

587
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:21,740
he said that actually many many years

588
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:26,149
ago um under a DEA license that the Ole

589
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:29,388
Miss had shipped some seeds to I don't

590
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:32,778
know how they weakened it so much but

591
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:35,138
yeah but it's real cannabis well it

592
00:26:32,778 --> 00:26:35,138
might say

593
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,949
other strains produce I'm just making a

594
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:41,539
point but to echo sort of the challenges

595
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,819
of doing this type of research when we

596
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:47,869
wanted to do a study looking at a high

597
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:51,678
CBD treatment the night of the farm

598
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:54,919
ultimately developed a 16% plant and

599
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,259
that we ran into conflict with the FDA

600
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,519
who had concerns about the safety that

601
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:01,129
there wasn't adequate human safety

602
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:02,569
trials and vaporized and smoking high

603
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,240
CBD so then we had to go through a

604
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:07,730
negotiation to come up with a compromise

605
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,308
of to 8% set cetera but there are

606
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,710
challenges that getting high CBD content

607
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:14,829
out of Mississippi particularly when it

608
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,120
comes to being kind of oral treatment

609
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:18,710
they now have an extract I think they

610
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,029
have going and then the last thing I

611
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:21,860
just want to echo is the frustration

612
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:24,259
amongst all of us in terms of being able

613
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:25,819
to access real world cannabis so in

614
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:28,250
addition to the medical side which were

615
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:29,359
very interested at CMC are I commented

616
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,750
that we're also interested in public

617
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:34,969
safety and from edibles to infuse drinks

618
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:37,308
etc we cannot touch those products at

619
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:39,410
all to either see what's in them or to

620
00:27:37,308 --> 00:27:41,779
see what effects are either cognitive or

621
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:44,120
medicinal a Bennett medical benefits and

622
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:46,519
so forth so it is a very frustrating

623
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:49,039
situation find out so I think we've

624
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,289
really covered the idea that the sole

625
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,480
source from Ole Miss has been a real

626
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:54,889
challenge as far as getting research to

627
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,960
the level that we'd like to see it at as

628
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:59,090
well as the challenges of getting

629
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,569
materials across you know across states

630
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:04,099
and into different territories well one

631
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:06,230
of the things I think that we didn't

632
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,939
really touch on I think is something

633
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,860
that's super key to the industry itself

634
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,509
is the idea of moving money right

635
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:13,579
cannabis companies have a hard time

636
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:16,519
moving money because you can have a bank

637
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:21,109
and so speaking from our experience as a

638
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:23,298
as a publicly traded cannabis company we

639
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:25,609
are fortunate to have relationships

640
00:28:23,298 --> 00:28:27,500
where we're sponsoring its industry

641
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:29,750
sponsored research and we're working

642
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,240
with eight different come different

643
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:34,429
universities in the US and abroad and

644
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,440
the biggest challenge we have is what to

645
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:39,140
do with the money or how to transfer the

646
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,630
money and I imagine that all of you have

647
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,880
your own experience with funding or lack

648
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:46,210
of funding or moving money and I would

649
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,460
you any of you care to jump on that one

650
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:51,069
the Center for the city of cannabis at

651
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:56,259
UC Irvine has a legal component and that

652
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:59,109
component is heavily interested in the

653
00:28:56,259 --> 00:29:01,808
issue of banking in in the cannabis

654
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:05,528
industry unfortunately the person who

655
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:07,028
runs the illegal part of the center is

656
00:29:05,528 --> 00:29:12,339
not here his name is Professor Robert

657
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:17,429
Solomon and he's not here today but this

658
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:20,439
is clearly a matter that deserves a

659
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:23,080
conversation that must be started and it

660
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,340
has already started must be expanded

661
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:26,618
state-by-state

662
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:29,138
there are ways in my limited

663
00:29:26,618 --> 00:29:32,128
understanding there are ways through

664
00:29:29,138 --> 00:29:36,368
which we can overcome the current

665
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:38,678
restrictions they do not require any

666
00:29:36,368 --> 00:29:42,459
major intervention from the federal

667
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:45,749
government however how feasible those

668
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:49,720
ways are is a matter that legal experts

669
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:52,028
adjudicate in very different ways so

670
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:58,919
what has predominated so far has been a

671
00:29:52,028 --> 00:30:04,990
very conservative outlook basically

672
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:07,600
stopping short any attempt to change the

673
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:13,058
status quo but I am optimistic

674
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:15,189
especially because revenues are at stake

675
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:17,888
here important state revenues are at

676
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:21,220
stake and important issues are at stake

677
00:30:17,888 --> 00:30:24,158
how do you pay taxes and we know that

678
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:27,220
our regulators our our lawmakers want to

679
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,409
tax money so I am optimistic that

680
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,889
something will change in that direction

681
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:35,379
I think pretty soon if I could also

682
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:38,378
bring my very very limited very small

683
00:30:35,378 --> 00:30:42,038
experience as director of the Center for

684
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:44,859
the Study of cannabis we we reached out

685
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:47,970
to cannabis companies and we had a

686
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:51,788
overwhelmingly positive positive

687
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:54,730
response everybody wanted to help us in

688
00:30:51,788 --> 00:30:57,490
some way or another and then we reached

689
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,569
out to our own University of California

690
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:02,390
Office of the President

691
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:03,470
and ask them and that was probably

692
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,810
mistaken I'm just kidding

693
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,220
ask them I always say it's always better

694
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:09,950
to ask for forgiveness than for

695
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:13,039
permission right but you know we did ask

696
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:15,620
their opinion honestly and they were

697
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,519
understandably very very cautious yeah

698
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:22,939
they they said well you know if it comes

699
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,490
from the selling the cultivating the

700
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,380
distributing of cannabis you cannot take

701
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:30,769
any money not even as a gift

702
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,900
so put a cannabis company work if they

703
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:36,470
aren't doing any of those things it's

704
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:38,420
that so but they to the interesting

705
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:42,049
anyone that goes on on a positive note

706
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:43,490
the interesting thing is that there is

707
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:46,190
money involved and when there is money

708
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:48,019
involved people get motivated so even

709
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:50,210
even the office of the president of my

710
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:51,740
great institution even though they are

711
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,259
very conservative they would like to

712
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,329
change things they just want to see some

713
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:57,980
light at the end of the tunnel and of

714
00:31:56,329 --> 00:32:00,619
course I don't want to bring up this

715
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:02,450
issue a political issue here but with

716
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:06,919
the current political scenario with the

717
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:09,259
current Attorney General there is quite

718
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,960
quite hard it's a quite hard stance to

719
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:15,319
take when you have against you the

720
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,039
Department of Justice just globally the

721
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:20,659
research funding available in the US has

722
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:23,480
traditionally been available only to

723
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,830
study cannabis as a drug of abuse so

724
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,990
this is what we've been up against

725
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:29,539
trying to do efficacy trials on cannabis

726
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:33,470
we've never gotten government money to

727
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:35,029
study efficacy until just recently got

728
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,519
our first government grant from the

729
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:39,980
state of Colorado but again it's the

730
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,990
states that are taking the initiative to

731
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,000
study efficacy the federal government

732
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,859
there's very little more only recently

733
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,730
have we seen federal government money

734
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:51,819
available small amounts to study

735
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:54,769
cannabis as a substitution for opioids

736
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:57,889
and but those are fairly small grants

737
00:32:54,769 --> 00:33:01,279
and I really applaud you know Tom and

738
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:03,560
CMC are there work I mean they have done

739
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,970
all the most of the seminal studies

740
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:09,829
looking at cannabis as as a medicine as

741
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:11,509
looking at efficacy and safety in the

742
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:13,399
same studies

743
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:15,710
so their work I don't we would hardly

744
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,980
have any efficacy at all if it weren't

745
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:21,079
for the California state funding of CMC

746
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:24,019
our many years ago and they're now

747
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:26,689
renewed funding so I'm hoping you know

748
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:29,269
the reason we have data is because of

749
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,910
these guys here that are doing this work

750
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:35,349
but I want to point out that you know in

751
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:38,570
Cal in Canada we see Canadian al P's

752
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:41,209
allocating millions of dollars to study

753
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:44,569
cannabis as a medicine now this is a big

754
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:47,029
game-changer I think that will help and

755
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:49,579
they understand that paying for clinical

756
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:51,619
trials means millions of dollars when

757
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:54,769
industry people in the US

758
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:57,199
tell dr. ple that they want to help fund

759
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:58,759
his research I think they're looking at

760
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,250
you know maybe a ten thousand dollar

761
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:01,879
grant or maybe you know five or ten

762
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,859
grand

763
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,930
they don't understand to do a controlled

764
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:07,189
trial is millions of dollars that the

765
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:09,889
study we're doing right now

766
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:13,909
a simple FDA Phase two trial with only

767
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:16,159
76 subjects is 2.2 million dollars and

768
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:18,529
that's a very you know low-budget trial

769
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,299
so you just have to you know industry

770
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,190
has to be aware that when they say they

771
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,460
want to fund controlled trials that

772
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:27,260
they're looking at millions of dollars

773
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,059
maybe not for your work but but

774
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:32,120
generally that's what it costs for human

775
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:34,309
trials I completely agree with sue about

776
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:36,469
the funding being sort of few and far

777
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:38,349
between we have been fairly fortunate

778
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:40,819
recently sort of this take-home study

779
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:42,920
looking at vaporized cannabis versus

780
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:45,289
dronabinol actually is funded by NIDA

781
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,400
surprisingly enough and this other

782
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:48,559
studies that are more mechanistic

783
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,260
looking a bipolar disorder and HIV

784
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,519
neuropathic pain are also NIH funding so

785
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,500
there's a little movement in the

786
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:56,900
direction to look at non sort of

787
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:01,099
addictive behaviors but it's still not

788
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:05,059
very much money so I just want to point

789
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:07,059
out from a high level that even though I

790
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:08,869
think it's really really good that

791
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:12,049
companies are trying to fund research

792
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:13,219
that was our decision was that we could

793
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,880
get this research done more effectively

794
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:19,819
inside a company than in any other way

795
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,070
and the LP is in Canada have enough

796
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:26,390
money and the universities there can do

797
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:29,330
and companies like GV Sciences are

798
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:32,929
pushing hard to do real research and all

799
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:35,029
of that is critical and it's gonna be

800
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:36,409
critical for a few years but I just want

801
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:39,560
us all to keep in mind that there's a

802
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:43,069
reason why in the rest of the research

803
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:45,739
world the government funds basic

804
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:49,309
research and then when that research

805
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:52,729
gets far enough along that it can be it

806
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:54,679
can turn into something applied the

807
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,090
private sector takes it over and brings

808
00:35:54,679 --> 00:36:00,230
things to market and that's how the

809
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:03,410
world works and that's fine but the

810
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:06,679
reason why basic research is funded by

811
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:10,009
the government is because it's really

812
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:11,960
expensive and the first many stages in

813
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:15,260
most research programs are nowhere near

814
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:17,030
a product it's the basic research that

815
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,230
lays the groundwork and companies don't

816
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,490
want to pay for that basic research

817
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:22,309
because it's too many years away from

818
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:24,769
any product and if it gets done in

819
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:26,900
universities with federal funding you

820
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:28,460
can do those years of basic research and

821
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:33,110
you can do them in a way that is

822
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:35,449
impartial and not you know prone to

823
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:37,700
being shifted in any way by commercial

824
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:39,889
interests so we're going into this phase

825
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:41,539
now where a lot of the research on

826
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:45,170
cannabis is gonna be funded by companies

827
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:47,179
and I think up most of us are

828
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,309
well-intentioned but that's not how

829
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:53,059
research should really be done it should

830
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:55,159
be done by universities without

831
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:57,529
commercial pressures driving them to

832
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:59,949
come up with certain results so we need

833
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:02,210
to get through this period and

834
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:04,730
ultimately the research should go away

835
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:06,199
from you and me angel these guys agree

836
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,929
one of the things we were talking about

837
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:10,179
sort of as a group is that the cannabis

838
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:12,559
industry is sort of plagued by

839
00:37:10,179 --> 00:37:13,849
pseudoscience and I think that's really

840
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,460
what you're talking about is because

841
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:18,529
there's that absence of a large database

842
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:21,289
of that basic science happening like in

843
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:23,990
other fields things fill in the gap and

844
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:26,298
so with anyone else like to talk if you

845
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:29,899
don't mind I have a comment on

846
00:37:26,298 --> 00:37:32,778
I don't want to give this audience the

847
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,309
the impression that when we are dealing

848
00:37:32,778 --> 00:37:37,478
with the federal government we are

849
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:40,339
dealing with a monolithic structure mono

850
00:37:37,478 --> 00:37:41,928
ideological structure of course you know

851
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:44,630
the federal government is influenced by

852
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:46,849
the administration that's because that's

853
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:50,390
their boss right but it doesn't mean

854
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:54,259
that people within don't have their very

855
00:37:50,389 --> 00:37:56,900
articulated and strong opinions that

856
00:37:54,259 --> 00:38:00,528
they temporarily keep you know under

857
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:03,528
wrap but eventually can and will I think

858
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:04,789
I'm out I've been working with the

859
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:06,829
National Eastern and drug abuse for

860
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:08,179
example for the last twenty years and

861
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:10,640
been a member of their national advisory

862
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:12,489
panel I've been on study sections I know

863
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,900
very well and I'm friendly with their

864
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:16,999
scientific director with director Nora

865
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,739
walk-up I know where they're standing on

866
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:20,419
this matter they're concerned of course

867
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:22,429
about the use of cannabis but they're

868
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,380
also cognizant of the potential

869
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:26,660
applications the potential health

870
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:31,278
applications they are cognizant but

871
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:34,818
don't forget their job their mission is

872
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:37,579
not to fund Studies on the health

873
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:39,349
effects of cannabis the positive effects

874
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:40,818
of canvas they're called the National

875
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:44,179
Institute on Drug Abuse they have a

876
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:46,518
mission and they have to study abusable

877
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:48,559
drugs of abuse part is what they care

878
00:38:46,518 --> 00:38:49,968
about so what we're really missing when

879
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:54,559
it comes to the federal government is

880
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:56,568
first of all political will that is the

881
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:59,839
first thing and second we are missing an

882
00:38:56,568 --> 00:39:02,869
inter Institute agency through the NIH

883
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:06,528
through including the NSF Cancer

884
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:11,329
Institute the FDA the look says in a

885
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:15,228
unified thoughtful intelligent way and

886
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:17,209
has some a part has a portfolio so it

887
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:19,218
has the ability to access funding

888
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:21,649
because this is not something about drug

889
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:23,329
abuse or something about mental health

890
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,999
or something about neurological

891
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:28,009
disorders or something about cancer it's

892
00:39:25,998 --> 00:39:31,759
something about each of those things

893
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:34,789
together and ultimately scientists

894
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:38,208
people with experience in the problem

895
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:39,220
must be able to make a recommendation

896
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:42,368
that can

897
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:43,509
be heard and that is where that's why

898
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:45,340
the National Academy of Science

899
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:48,430
Committee on the impact of cannabis that

900
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:51,010
was a member of decided you know wrote

901
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:53,348
as a recommendation the creation of a

902
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:56,800
research agenda on cannabis that brings

903
00:39:53,349 --> 00:40:00,099
together all those federal stakeholders

904
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,340
and gives them a unified voice and

905
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:05,410
possibly unified portfolio as well so

906
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,570
let's be let's look at the at the

907
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:09,549
federal government with some positivity

908
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:11,619
I know it's hard right now but let's try

909
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,210
and make that effort because I think

910
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:15,700
that's that's that's really really

911
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:19,059
important the last topic that we wanted

912
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:20,710
to sort of address was many people may

913
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:24,969
be following the medical cannabis

914
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:27,389
research act of 2018 and one of the

915
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:30,459
things that it proposes to do is to

916
00:40:27,389 --> 00:40:34,659
eliminate the sole source by forcing DEA

917
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:39,519
to admit at least two more certified

918
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:41,618
cultivator growers and also open up some

919
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:45,070
rights to the Veterans Affairs

920
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:46,930
Department I don't I would like at this

921
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:49,750
point to simply throw this one over to

922
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:51,009
the panel for those with those panel

923
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:55,599
members who would like to jump on that

924
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:57,730
and give their opinion I don't support

925
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,059
that bill even though I recognize that

926
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:02,769
this could be symbolically the end of

927
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:04,449
the monopoly with University of

928
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:09,400
Mississippi but the fact that they're

929
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:11,769
only agreeing to license to new growers

930
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,150
for research and they're probably going

931
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:15,969
you know this is just basically just

932
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:18,700
creating a corporate monopoly on top of

933
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:21,039
what is already an existing University

934
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:23,439
monopoly of Mississippi so I'm not a fan

935
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:25,960
of this I think the only right thing to

936
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,920
do is for the government to properly

937
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,449
adjudicate all 25-plus applications that

938
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,789
have been sitting on their desk and

939
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:36,759
evaluate all of them in terms of merit

940
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:39,250
in terms of quotas and and let's do this

941
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,830
properly when I apply for a de a

942
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:45,519
Schedule one license as a researcher

943
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:47,380
every single application gets evaluated

944
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,630
it's not like we just say oh we're gonna

945
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:52,630
look at these two application you know

946
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:54,910
just pick the the two best if you have

947
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:57,099
a properly approved protocol a

948
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:59,889
scientific protocol and you will be

949
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:01,779
approved for a DEA schedule one license

950
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:04,329
as a researcher which is what we have

951
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:07,540
but to say I'm only going to take two I

952
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:11,529
think it's it's a it's a bad model and

953
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:14,469
it's it looks like you know it this has

954
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:18,640
been created by some of Gates's donors

955
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:20,649
to to ensure that they get a license and

956
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:22,690
I think it's really unfair but we do

957
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,170
need to end this monopoly and I'm hoping

958
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:27,730
someday you know the same way till Ray

959
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:30,670
exported study you know or its planning

960
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:34,059
to export drug for Toms tremor study

961
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:36,970
maybe some day till ray will agree to to

962
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:39,309
export flower into the US and then we

963
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:42,369
can finally break the monopoly on flower

964
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:45,670
and force the government to license

965
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:49,019
other growers so I've been wondering um

966
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:52,090
even if they do license to other grows

967
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:54,400
aren't they just gonna aren't the laws

968
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:56,289
gonna be such that they have to get

969
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,400
their starting material from Mississippi

970
00:42:56,289 --> 00:43:02,800
anyway that's assuming although I spoke

971
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,869
to dr. L solely who runs the University

972
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,200
of Mississippi lab and he said that he

973
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:11,230
refuses to sell starter material because

974
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:13,329
he said that that's their IP so the

975
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:15,280
University of Mississippi has it not

976
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:17,679
that anybody would want their genetics

977
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,260
anyway but the point is that that's

978
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,969
taxpayer dollars going that have gone to

979
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,490
support this monopoly and now he's

980
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:26,829
saying that it's protected as their IP

981
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:28,919
and they're not willing to share it so I

982
00:43:26,829 --> 00:43:32,139
have no I think they in in our

983
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,940
application we had to list which foreign

984
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:35,799
entities we were gonna buy from so we

985
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:41,050
have to purchase genetics from outside

986
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:43,090
the US I like to make two points one is

987
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:46,450
immediately related to the previous

988
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:48,100
speakers and is not a scientific point

989
00:43:46,449 --> 00:43:51,489
but I'll still like to make it and it's

990
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:53,409
the following so if we you know think

991
00:43:51,489 --> 00:43:54,639
about the Soviet Union the Soviet Union

992
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:58,389
was a socialistic

993
00:43:54,639 --> 00:44:01,000
country so property was entirely owned

994
00:43:58,389 --> 00:44:05,559
by the state and then it became a

995
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,429
private country so in that process not a

996
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:09,099
lot of good things

997
00:44:06,429 --> 00:44:11,379
happen right I think we have to be a

998
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:14,230
little bit thinking about about that

999
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:17,769
model as we consider the passage from a

1000
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:19,900
state monopoly to now a new situation

1001
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:22,719
where there is no monopoly and there are

1002
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:25,480
private individuals bidding or working

1003
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:27,939
to get to get a piece of the public of

1004
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,440
the cake now the reason why I think this

1005
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,929
is so important is because let's not

1006
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,389
forget that a lot of the folks who were

1007
00:44:31,929 --> 00:44:36,239
growing canopies were folks from

1008
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:40,989
minorities from underrepresented

1009
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:44,469
minorities and these folks are more and

1010
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:46,358
more excluded from the business and they

1011
00:44:44,469 --> 00:44:50,459
don't have a voice because the cannabis

1012
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:54,068
industry has a voice can be more or less

1013
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:56,289
audible but isn't is a voice but these

1014
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:58,480
folks tend to not to have a voice and I

1015
00:44:56,289 --> 00:45:00,849
think I think the one thing they would

1016
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,440
be terrible if I'm thinking petit about

1017
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:04,720
the state of California if moving

1018
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:08,079
forward we got into a situation from a

1019
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:11,588
monopoly of the state to an oligopoly

1020
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,200
from from large corporations and some of

1021
00:45:11,588 --> 00:45:17,259
the folks who have been part of this

1022
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:19,328
industry forever now would be penalized

1023
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:23,410
so that's the first thing there is a

1024
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:25,660
scientific point that the thank you the

1025
00:45:23,409 --> 00:45:27,250
scientific point I think is I'd love to

1026
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:29,409
hear your comments about it and also

1027
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:31,690
your comments about it as if especially

1028
00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:34,960
as a geneticist because I am NOT a plant

1029
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:37,119
geneticist so I read and what I read I

1030
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,349
may or may not understand so here is

1031
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:44,200
what I the problem that I have with

1032
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:46,568
cannabis is that we have hemp and then

1033
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:48,818
we have marijuana right with an H this

1034
00:45:46,568 --> 00:45:50,829
is how the federal government defer

1035
00:45:48,818 --> 00:45:53,440
divides the plant right marijuana in

1036
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:54,849
hemp and they are knowledge it's the

1037
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,889
same thing but I think they are

1038
00:45:54,849 --> 00:46:01,780
knowledge it at the same time they deny

1039
00:45:56,889 --> 00:46:06,608
it and to me understanding the diversity

1040
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:08,740
of the plant before we take any measure

1041
00:46:06,608 --> 00:46:10,000
or at least at the same time as we take

1042
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:13,029
measures to ant

1043
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,389
pack this monopoly I think it's really

1044
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:18,490
really important we still don't know and

1045
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:19,639
Duke magalie correct me if I'm wrong but

1046
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:24,469
we still don't know

1047
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:27,230
if a plant has more THC than it does CBD

1048
00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:28,789
there is an enzyme that makes either of

1049
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:30,260
them there's one enzyme for one and

1050
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:35,840
other enzyme for another they have a

1051
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:38,480
shared precursor why some strains have

1052
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,130
one more of one and why some strains are

1053
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,889
more than another is there how the

1054
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:44,690
environment can affect that and how this

1055
00:46:42,889 --> 00:46:49,549
plays out with the other a hundred

1056
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:51,139
Andrew cannabinoids number growing that

1057
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:53,300
are present in the plant like an urban

1058
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:55,940
are very we will kind of be devouring

1059
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:58,460
that was mentioned before so there is no

1060
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,530
talk even at the federal level and they

1061
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:04,179
know because I've been talking to folks

1062
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:06,080
in DC about this there is no talk of

1063
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:09,199
looking at this from a scientific

1064
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:11,179
scientific perspective and asking so

1065
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,960
what is this thing what is this plant

1066
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:16,909
how is it that he has these properties

1067
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,980
those things we can figure out and we're

1068
00:47:16,909 --> 00:47:21,170
starting to so we know how many copies

1069
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:23,210
of the THC synthase and the CBD synthase

1070
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,409
are in those plants now and you know

1071
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:26,929
we're tracking down all the metabolic

1072
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:29,210
pathways and then in the future if we're

1073
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:30,980
gonna have whole plant medicine it'll be

1074
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:32,780
a genetically defined plant where we

1075
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,369
know okay this is a plant that makes

1076
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:38,480
these compounds because it has these

1077
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:45,049
genes and those are knowable things

1078
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:47,360
right yeah and we're getting there so a

1079
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:50,600
while back the governor of New Jersey

1080
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:52,190
said when they legalized cannabis in New

1081
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:55,069
Jersey that it should be grown at

1082
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:56,840
Rutgers Rutgers said they couldn't do it

1083
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:59,120
because the federal government would cut

1084
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,160
off their federal money and recently I

1085
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:05,539
believe that Jerry Brown vetoed a bill

1086
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:07,429
that would have allowed universities in

1087
00:48:05,539 --> 00:48:09,529
California grow their own cannabis I

1088
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:11,389
wonder what you think about the New

1089
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:13,269
Jersey recommendation and I wonder what

1090
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:17,389
you think about Governor Brown vetoing

1091
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:19,429
is this bill that about two days ago

1092
00:48:17,389 --> 00:48:22,579
Brown vetoed a bill that would have

1093
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:24,859
allowed universities in California to

1094
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:27,230
grow their own cannabis obviously that

1095
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:29,059
would have put California on a collision

1096
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:31,219
course with the federal government and

1097
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:34,369
Brown apparently didn't want to do that

1098
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:37,009
but the looks like the legislature

1099
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:39,440
understood what dr. Sicily is talking

1100
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:41,750
about that we need if we're going to do

1101
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,990
research we need to let the researchers

1102
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:46,219
grow cannabis in fact the DEA

1103
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:47,809
administrative law judge when it came to

1104
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:48,649
the University of Massachusetts said

1105
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:50,900
yeah

1106
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:53,570
let dr. cracker grow his own cannabis I

1107
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:55,700
mean this is absurd we're talking about

1108
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:58,970
research here we're not talking I'm

1109
00:48:55,699 --> 00:49:01,779
talking about crummy 4% cannabis that is

1110
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:06,039
grown in the University of Mississippi

1111
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:10,370
I'll just I'll just say that of all the

1112
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:13,519
decisions that suck for all of us that

1113
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:15,019
one I can understand because the the

1114
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:16,639
reason why it's been so hard to do

1115
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:19,900
research on cannabis in university I

1116
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:22,129
mean correct me if I'm wrong has been a

1117
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:24,950
feeling that you're a federally funded

1118
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:26,780
University and if you piss off the

1119
00:49:24,949 --> 00:49:28,789
federal government too much you could

1120
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:32,360
lose your funding and get no research

1121
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:35,269
done and the UC system has been way more

1122
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:37,160
aggressive than any other universities

1123
00:49:35,269 --> 00:49:39,289
anywhere but they've also been very

1124
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:41,029
careful about it one thing that no

1125
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:44,360
university has done is just start to

1126
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:46,430
grow with the plan and and I think if a

1127
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,690
university went that and that's the most

1128
00:49:46,429 --> 00:49:51,679
frustrating thing for me but I think if

1129
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:54,590
any university went that far they would

1130
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:57,079
be in concrete danger of being shut down

1131
00:49:54,590 --> 00:50:01,070
or having their funding stopped by by

1132
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:04,369
the feds and so I think that was a

1133
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:07,550
pragmatic decision different experience

1134
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:10,849
so we're working with at LSU the LSU AG

1135
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:13,039
center and unders the state regulated

1136
00:50:10,849 --> 00:50:15,829
program there the university is allowed

1137
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:18,349
to grow and we're doing our private

1138
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:21,019
vendor so you're a private banner okay

1139
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:24,170
so there are models that but it's not on

1140
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:29,179
campus a hybrid model okay but there are

1141
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:31,010
let's say there's workarounds even that

1142
00:50:29,179 --> 00:50:34,399
blows my mind I'm really impressed with

1143
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:36,410
with Louisiana for doing that maybe

1144
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,700
right here in Louisiana I'm not sure if

1145
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:39,699
you can if you're in California

1146
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,328
but in my understanding of the veto

1147
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:46,220
going back to the question and this

1148
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:49,430
might I might be wrong but I read the

1149
00:50:46,219 --> 00:50:52,689
letter that Governor Brown wrote and it

1150
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:55,308
specifically blocked a bill that was

1151
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:57,500
authorizing expenditure of two million

1152
00:50:55,309 --> 00:50:58,760
dollars per year to my friends here at

1153
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,219
the University of California San Diego

1154
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,890
and the reason why the reason why were

1155
00:51:01,219 --> 00:51:06,139
they were they were made for vetoing it

1156
00:51:03,889 --> 00:51:09,768
was not in opposition to science was the

1157
00:51:06,139 --> 00:51:13,190
fact that there wasn't what Prop 64 had

1158
00:51:09,768 --> 00:51:14,838
explicitly explicitly stated and so

1159
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:16,579
there is some politics behind this I

1160
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:20,528
think the Bureau of cannabis control

1161
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:24,619
which is the agency that has been

1162
00:51:20,528 --> 00:51:28,548
nominated to create it to really

1163
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:31,309
implement prop 64 I think they for some

1164
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:34,190
reason feel that they are in charge of

1165
00:51:31,309 --> 00:51:36,859
the entire part of money but this might

1166
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:38,990
be my over interpretation of that the

1167
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:41,058
fact it was my remote understanding that

1168
00:51:38,989 --> 00:51:44,179
that's why it ended up being this is

1169
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:46,849
1996 vetoed what sort of complexities of

1170
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:49,368
matching up what cm CR was gonna do via

1171
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:50,990
prop 64 or other mechanisms and there

1172
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:52,640
was some confusion I don't think as

1173
00:51:50,989 --> 00:51:57,528
Danielli says I don't think was specific

1174
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:58,818
to cultivation and stopping that there's

1175
00:51:57,528 --> 00:52:01,130
a lot of people that are looking for

1176
00:51:58,818 --> 00:52:03,500
sources of cannabinoids outside of the

1177
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:05,390
cannabis plant whether it's synthesizing

1178
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:08,179
it in the laboratory growing it from

1179
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:10,129
strains of hops or using East to grow

1180
00:52:08,179 --> 00:52:12,078
cannabinoids I wanted to get your take

1181
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:13,338
and see if you think that this is

1182
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,548
something that will pave the way for

1183
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:17,900
more widespread open research or if it's

1184
00:52:16,548 --> 00:52:20,088
something that would keep it in the

1185
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,579
hands of corporate research and

1186
00:52:20,088 --> 00:52:24,018
pharmaceutical companies so there's a

1187
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:25,700
few different ways people are trying to

1188
00:52:24,018 --> 00:52:28,129
get cannabinoids besides the cannabis

1189
00:52:25,699 --> 00:52:31,460
plant there are companies that are

1190
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:32,809
trying to put the genes that make all of

1191
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:37,519
the necessary parts that can have

1192
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:38,869
annoyed pathway into East it's hard for

1193
00:52:37,518 --> 00:52:41,389
me to imagine that those are going to

1194
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:42,798
scale up in a way that adds up

1195
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:47,058
economically because the cannabis plant

1196
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:50,568
is an incredible production engine so I

1197
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:52,309
don't know what will happen with that if

1198
00:52:50,568 --> 00:52:54,139
that becomes the dominant way the

1199
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:56,420
cannabinoids are made

1200
00:52:54,139 --> 00:53:00,348
that'll centralize control of that in

1201
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:05,480
the hands of companies but the plant

1202
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:12,190
will still exist there is also now a

1203
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:12,190
bunch of cannabis

1204
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:51,849
