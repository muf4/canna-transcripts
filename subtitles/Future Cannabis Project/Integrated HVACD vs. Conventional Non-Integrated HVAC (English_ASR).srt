1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,318
systems that have been adapted from

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,359
other industries that are not designed

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,120
for cultivation

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,480
are like fitting a square peg into a

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,638
round hole

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,839
the fact is cannabis is a living

7
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:13,759
organism that has different

8
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,199
environmental requirements based on its

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,719
stage of life

10
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,480
it's not a it's not a static load

11
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:21,118
requirement like human centric comfort

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,719
cooling or an indoor pool facility

13
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,640
the 10 cardinal parameters work

14
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,960
synergistically and all of them need to

15
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,960
be optimized to ensure crucial kpis are

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,160
met such as grams per square foot and

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,079
price per pound

18
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,600
hvacd tells the full story of what

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,799
environmental control for cannabis

20
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,399
should do

21
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,919
sure there's heat load from the lights

22
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,840
it needs to be accounted for

23
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,359
but it takes about twice as much work to

24
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,520
dehumidify than it does to remove heat

25
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,519
and through the process of transpiration

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,840
plants act as perfect little humidifiers

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,239
in cultivation rooms and without proper

28
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,920
modulating dehumidification humidity

29
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,599
rates and vpd simply cannot be

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,920
maintained

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,079
but we have a huge challenge here how

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,000
can you determine what a proper hvac d

33
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,159
system looks like how much should it

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,118
cost how do you compare competing

35
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,400
systems on a true apples-to-apples basis

36
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,159
we're going to help answer these

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,600
questions over the next 30 minutes as

38
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,479
adrienne and rob walk us through the

39
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:18,559
concepts of a coordinated design process

40
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,079
the performance and cost differences of

41
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,240
conventional non-integrated and

42
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,079
integrated hvac d systems

43
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,839
and a crash course on leveling bids and

44
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,519
important kpis

45
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,159
with that i'll pass it off to adrian to

46
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,158
get us started

47
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,478
thank you brian indoor cannabis and

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,519
horticulture projects are extremely

49
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,519
complex

50
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,599
and in a way we're constructing an

51
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,280
entire campus

52
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,359
in a near in nearly every building

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,879
that's purpose built or retrofitted for

54
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,040
indoor cultivation

55
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,759
and looking at this process map courtesy

56
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,799
of anderson porter architects

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,478
you can see why they're so complex

58
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,960
labor is one of the largest operational

59
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,879
costs so employee workflow is central to

60
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,319
an optimized facility

61
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,798
in addition to that you have lighting

62
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,679
strategies canopy area

63
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,280
cultivation methods and technologies

64
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,679
building envelope design

65
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,360
energy consumption building management

66
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,159
systems for data collection

67
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,400
and control maybe even on-site renewable

68
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,000
energy and microgrid controls

69
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,599
all of which need to come together in

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,520
harmony to meet your product

71
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,119
output goals and meet your business

72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,159
metrics and kpis

73
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,000
that we will talk about later on the use

74
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,759
of a coordinated design process

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,759
allows you the ability to assign

76
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,399
resources according to the limited

77
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,079
capital

78
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,000
available to any project now let us dig

79
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,519
in a bit into the two typical types of

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,080
project delivery methods

81
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,800
as well as the type of team members that

82
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,640
comprise

83
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,280
an indoor horticulture project plan spec

84
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,399
build on the top on the left is a more

85
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,400
traditional approach

86
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,080
that typically doesn't allow for as much

87
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,920
collaboration between the design and

88
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,239
construction teams

89
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,518
but it doesn't have to be that way you

90
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,680
as the owner get to

91
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,158
set the tone and the expectations for

92
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,400
your project

93
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,479
you want collaboration and want to work

94
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,879
through an architect as the quarterback

95
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,399
it is very possible but needs to be set

96
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,079
up that way from the start

97
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,680
and the architect needs to be selected

98
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,319
appropriately

99
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,080
an alternative method is design build

100
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,839
this method allows for the whole design

101
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,640
and construction team to be brought

102
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,039
under one

103
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,559
contract and work collaboratively from

104
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,639
the beginning

105
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,479
this is a true one throat to choke

106
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,000
scenario which works well

107
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,079
for complex and fast paced projects

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,239
regardless of the path you choose it is

109
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,879
imperative to ensure that each project

110
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,920
team member has the requisite cannabis

111
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,840
and horticulture

112
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,399
intimacy to avoid costly and common

113
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,158
mistakes

114
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,799
these professionals are somewhat rare in

115
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,560
the wild but they do exist

116
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,040
regardless of where the recommendations

117
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,199
come from be sure to fully vet

118
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,598
all project partners to the best of your

119
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,119
ability

120
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,039
by having the right professionals in

121
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,640
place as shown on the right side of the

122
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,878
screen with the owner in the middle

123
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,958
owner's representative surrounding them

124
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,959
or construction manager role

125
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,239
followed by the architect and the other

126
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,840
engineers and sub consultants and

127
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,959
ultimately contractors

128
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,040
all coordinated together allows you to

129
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,439
lock in a guaranteed maximum price

130
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,720
when possible allows you to limit your

131
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,879
risk

132
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,040
allows you to avoid change orders that

133
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,800
can be very costly

134
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,879
allows you to avoid work that needs to

135
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,560
be redone

136
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,439
there can be huge challenges with

137
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,959
projects moving so fast as these do

138
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,639
and making sure that all the bases are

139
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,239
covered up front so budgets and

140
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,519
timelines don't get inflated

141
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,199
is extremely important your project does

142
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,240
not have to cost more money

143
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,319
to execute in a coordinated fashion and

144
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,960
have it be sustainable in design

145
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,680
if desired get things done right the

146
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,638
first time

147
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,639
and it will pay off

148
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,400
now make sure you target the business

149
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,638
metrics and kpis that will drive

150
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,399
your business profitability be sure you

151
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,319
have selected the best site that you

152
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,159
have sufficient power available

153
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,240
you can get the appropriate licensing at

154
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,160
that location have the right amount

155
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,199
budgeted for the project

156
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,120
on and on and on before you jump in this

157
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
process is truly a delicate balance

158
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,680
between risk and reward

159
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,198
the rewards can be massive and the risks

160
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,439
can be crushing

161
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,560
our mission is to bring our experience

162
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,839
and ecosystem

163
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,560
to work together to maximize the rewards

164
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,239
and minimize the risks with that i'm

165
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,199
going to hand it off to robbie to talk

166
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,680
you through different hvacd system types

167
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,439
and why some systems outperform others

168
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,199
when using kpis of business

169
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,038
profitability

170
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,800
so we've spent about a decade walking

171
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:49,519
into indoor cannabis facilities of all

172
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,840
types

173
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,599
and like you'd expect no two rooms are

174
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,959
100 identical

175
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,560
but because we're putting a webinar

176
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,399
together that has to compare different

177
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,639
system types we've had to generalize

178
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,079
different systems and we did that based

179
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,720
on certain key features so we're going

180
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,639
to suggest

181
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,080
that those three major system types and

182
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,840
that each of them represents an

183
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,519
incrementally better approach

184
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,000
as we move through the generations of

185
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,000
designs

186
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,399
so let's start with the conventional

187
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,479
non-integrated design approach

188
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,000
just by looking at this picture you can

189
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,079
recognize this system type because it

190
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,439
has a pretty glaring feature

191
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,399
hanging from the ceilings are

192
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,279
dehumidifiers the primary hpc system

193
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,519
that you don't see

194
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,519
in the room is most likely a commercial

195
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,079
system really designed for regular

196
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,240
commercial

197
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,839
or office building type loads we're

198
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,519
using mini splits or

199
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,279
off-the-shelf package rooftop units

200
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,799
serving these rooms this is why we call

201
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,318
it a conventional system

202
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,840
i think it just can't handle the

203
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,160
humidity levels required

204
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,918
for a cultivation space alone and hence

205
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,280
we have all these d-hums installed in

206
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,959
between the lights

207
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,038
now the air coming off those d-hums is

208
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,079
probably about 110 120

209
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,879
in that range of temperature or higher

210
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,879
and now how is that now dehumidified hot

211
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,800
air going to float down to the plants

212
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,319
well it really isn't and that's why when

213
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,160
we take a deep look at the temperatures

214
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,639
and humidities in the spaces

215
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,240
we see incredibly inconsistent numbers

216
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,759
and conditions at the canopy are

217
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,519
rarely where the cultivator would like

218
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,439
them to be the fact is

219
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,639
it's almost impossible to tie all the

220
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,038
systems together

221
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,598
to achieve room consistency most of

222
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,879
these rooms have separate thermometers

223
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:26,639
for each of the different equipment

224
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,759
pieces and this is why we call it

225
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,598
non-integrated

226
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,199
so there we have it conventional air

227
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,519
conditioning paired with disparate

228
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,199
dehumidification equipment

229
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,399
each piece controlling separate set

230
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,000
points in a non-integrated family

231
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,679
now there's other problematic things you

232
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,598
might notice about the room looking

233
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,519
closely you see these concept drains

234
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,519
hanging off the side of the d-hums

235
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,439
we've found that these condoms clog

236
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,719
frequently and the result is dirty

237
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,120
condensate water

238
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,120
dripping into your canopy causing all

239
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,319
sorts of ipm problems that require extra

240
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,319
management

241
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,400
putting equipment in the room like this

242
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,080
is also a maintenance nightmare

243
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,560
sending maintenance people into a live

244
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,959
room to change filters or fix equipment

245
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,560
the biosecurity nightmare for sure and

246
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,719
cleaning all the services you see

247
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,560
is almost impossible so it's just extra

248
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,120
hard to keep cross-contamination

249
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,240
happening from one crop to the next

250
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,439
so why is all this a problem the fact is

251
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,360
it's a problem because it costs you

252
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,959
money now don't get me wrong

253
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,560
i'll be very clear people will grow

254
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,318
cannabis in these rooms

255
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,319
and a sharp cultivator can do it very

256
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,080
successfully to this day this is

257
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,360
probably the most popular setup for

258
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,799
indoor growing

259
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
some people have become millionaires

260
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,478
doing it these people did amazing work

261
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,320
with equipment that was commercially

262
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,158
available or even just available at the

263
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,680
local home depot

264
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,319
we congratulate them for everything

265
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,639
they've done in pioneering this industry

266
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,440
but now only in hindsight we know that

267
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,278
cultivators

268
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,640
could have been so much more profitable

269
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,799
if we could have addressed the items i

270
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,199
just mentioned

271
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,879
so as the industry evolved we ended up

272
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,320
seeing dehumidification specific

273
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,480
equipment providing temperature and

274
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,640
humidity control for the growing rooms

275
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,000
how do i know this based on the picture

276
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,838
on the screen

277
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,080
well where are the dehumidifiers they're

278
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,519
gone

279
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,120
this is an indication that another

280
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,839
off-the-shelf piece of equipment most

281
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,278
likely

282
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,200
a system designed for pool room

283
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,200
dehumidification for example

284
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,480
is serving the space now the best thing

285
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,759
about this approach

286
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
is that the temperature and humidity

287
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,559
control are integrated so this is an

288
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,600
integrated system one piece is doing

289
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,199
both jobs

290
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,600
and that means the hvac has a much

291
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,000
better chance of getting the things

292
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,320
right inside the room but the fact is

293
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,559
this is still a conventional system

294
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,760
it's conventional because the equipment

295
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,639
we're using

296
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,200
may have been designed for

297
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,679
dehumidification but it was designed for

298
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,839
human

299
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,838
centric dehumidification pool room

300
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,279
dehumidifiers are just not intended for

301
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,640
the cultivation industry

302
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,480
i want to take a minute to stress this

303
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,958
difference serving a space with a pool

304
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,200
in it

305
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,639
versus a space with plants in it is so

306
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,240
very very different

307
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,000
the biggest difference is if i'm

308
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,159
swimming in a pool i want all that water

309
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,360
a nice warm 80 degrees plus fahrenheit

310
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,879
temperature

311
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,959
frankly to keep that pool at that

312
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,159
temperature it takes a lot of energy

313
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,759
the people who make pool room

314
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,039
dehumidifiers know this and they take

315
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,159
every last bit of energy from the

316
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,679
compression cycle

317
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,679
and they put it into the water using

318
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,159
special heat exchangers

319
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,838
now because the pools need so much heat

320
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,600
they literally have no incentive to make

321
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,640
their dehumidification process more

322
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,879
efficient

323
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,720
the more compressor tonnage they use the

324
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,039
more energy they can dump into the pool

325
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,360
why

326
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,199
fight it look the hvac industry has

327
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,039
better ways to dehumidify air

328
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,800
but none of those waves make sense to

329
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,159
someone building a dehumidifier for

330
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,000
natatoriums

331
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,439
now if you're asking yourself so what

332
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,360
the answer that question is

333
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,519
these rooms are still costing you so

334
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,039
much money and this isn't just about

335
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,879
energy consumption costs

336
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,120
yes running all those compressors all

337
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,559
the time leads to huge energy bills and

338
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,200
that stinks

339
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,719
but in an industry where cash flow and

340
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,278
time to harvest are so critically

341
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,278
important

342
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,039
ask yourself this how much more

343
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:57,759
electricity do you need to bring to a

344
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,879
building

345
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,559
where all the hvacd has 30 to 40 more

346
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,838
compressors than it needs

347
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,919
how long is your project going to get

348
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,160
delayed because the utility has to do

349
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:10,159
a huge infrastructure upgrade in your

350
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,000
part of the city

351
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,360
this isn't just big picture stuff either

352
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,399
think about what we see literally in

353
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,759
this picture

354
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,919
they're still running propeller fans

355
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,919
inside the room because the people who

356
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,799
shoehorn a pool room dehumidifier into

357
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,399
these facilities

358
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,479
maybe don't have the plant nvc they

359
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,839
should have they haven't focused on

360
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,560
getting the air where it's needed in the

361
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,399
room

362
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,159
this is a room filled with plants not an

363
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,360
empty room with a small lake at the

364
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,199
bottom of it

365
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,800
here's another challenge the conditions

366
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,240
in a pool room are about as constant as

367
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,359
you can imagine

368
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,200
but a proper cultivation hvac-d system

369
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,800
needs to perform optimally throughout a

370
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,480
vast range of conditions

371
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,078
think about the change in load when the

372
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,959
lights are on versus when the lights are

373
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,519
off

374
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,518
a flower room or a veg room isn't about

375
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,839
lowering the humidity as much as you can

376
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,440
all the time it's about keeping the

377
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,560
right level at the right time to bring

378
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,560
out the best of your plants

379
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,399
the bottom line is both integrated and

380
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,078
non-integrated and conventional systems

381
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,919
will lead to compromises

382
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,759
diseases show up in rooms because of the

383
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,159
interplay of a pathogen

384
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,600
a host and the environmental conditions

385
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,639
i'm not just trying to pick on pool room

386
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,440
dehumidifiers

387
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,399
we see server room hvac or 100 outside

388
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,079
air units

389
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,799
being applied and they have their own

390
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,638
whole host of challenges

391
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,240
but philosophically this is why the

392
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,519
starting point of integrated pest

393
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,039
management is cultural control

394
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,959
cultural control is environmental

395
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,838
control and if your environment is set

396
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,439
up correctly

397
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,839
you'll spend less time and less money

398
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,720
with physical biological and chemical

399
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,160
interventions

400
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,240
you're going to pull more and better

401
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,159
pounds out of your room

402
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,200
and so we land on the not so humbly

403
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,439
named inspire integrated hvac

404
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,320
system this is a system designed from

405
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,880
the ground up

406
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,959
with plan-centric environments in mind

407
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,759
the system is integrated i mean properly

408
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,879
integrated

409
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,039
control of the temperature and the

410
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,519
humidity control of the lights the co2

411
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,439
levels

412
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,039
even the room pressure for biosecurity

413
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,880
purposes

414
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,360
see this is a symphony controlled by a

415
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,278
brain that is married to equipment

416
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,120
designed specifically for the purpose of

417
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,559
enabling plant transpiration

418
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,399
now i could probably spend 20 minutes

419
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,159
telling you about how the run around

420
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,839
loop around our cooling coil

421
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,600
and inspire system will cut your power

422
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,839
bill by 30 or 40 percent

423
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,519
and if you're someone who's with utility

424
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,519
that's probably a big deal

425
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,799
but what's important if you're the one

426
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,360
responsible for actually growing plants

427
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,719
in a room

428
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,320
and what's important if you're actually

429
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,759
the one cutting a check for a project to

430
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,000
move forward

431
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,039
well maybe then the important part of

432
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,879
the story is

433
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,078
there's a good chance you can install

434
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,679
the hvacd

435
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,000
without needing that costly utility

436
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,958
upgrade maybe the important part is that

437
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,559
we can modulate

438
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,000
every one of the components responsible

439
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,719
for dehumidification and temperature

440
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,759
control

441
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,040
this means you can make sure your

442
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,639
temperatures and humidities are at the

443
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,240
level you want throughout the growing

444
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,959
cycle and day or night

445
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,120
not too hot not too cold not too wet not

446
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,879
too dry

447
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,240
how about if the important part isn't

448
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,679
the box outside the room

449
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,079
serving the air into the space what if

450
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,359
it's the forethought of a cfd model

451
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:06,879
before construction

452
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,399
to make sure the air you're sending into

453
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,838
the room actually makes it into the

454
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,039
canopy

455
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,560
the important part of the story might

456
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,278
not even be that it might be that every

457
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,198
minute

458
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,958
hundreds of data points from each room

459
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,799
cultivation to drying

460
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,879
are securely making it into the cloud

461
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,319
where you the owner or you the grower

462
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:23,600
can watch your rooms with one eye on

463
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,240
real-time performance

464
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,000
and another eye on historical trends

465
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,879
this isn't about a box moving in air

466
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,919
about a box moving air this is about

467
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,120
intimacy with plan

468
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,439
it's about intimacy with the

469
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,198
construction industry it's about taking

470
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,000
the process of transpiration so

471
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,639
seriously

472
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
you put in your company name so if you

473
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,039
do all these things right

474
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,039
you end up with a very different

475
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,799
triangle you end up

476
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,078
with a facility that actually lives up

477
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,919
to the promise

478
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,198
and you end up not using as many swear

479
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,240
words when talking about the air

480
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,439
conditioning system

481
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,000
it's the reason that hvacd as we do it

482
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,519
is obviously not a four-letter word when

483
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,198
the environment around the canopy is

484
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,440
conducive to plant vitality

485
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,679
without microclimates or in-room risk

486
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,120
factors like leaky condensate trains

487
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,039
you end up taking more pounds out of

488
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,639
that room than you otherwise could have

489
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,958
and every one of those pounds is

490
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,720
consistent enough to keep the top spot

491
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,239
on the shelves at the dispensary

492
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,320
where you've earned the trust to deliver

493
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,799
products you want now i'm not trying to

494
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,320
tell you that hvacd by inspire is going

495
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,159
to naturally earn you money

496
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,920
what i'm saying is that if you have a

497
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,439
room designed by people that have

498
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,120
cannabis intimacy

499
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,279
it's going to give you the ability to

500
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,720
grow a product that people will buy

501
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:33,759
and not just grow a bit of product i

502
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,560
mean you're going to be able to fill

503
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,879
that room

504
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,239
with healthy high demand plants was the

505
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:39,439
last time you saw a room with three

506
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,799
tiers of trays

507
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,880
layered into a 13 foot high space

508
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,399
so the heart of this into me starts

509
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,720
intimacy starts with data

510
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,480
and sizing your equipment right you need

511
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,320
to have real data from real rooms

512
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,839
that can help you with the task here's

513
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,680
an example of some of that data and the

514
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,880
simple formula we use to figure out the

515
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,439
point the peak

516
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,958
moisture removal capacity we need for

517
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,600
equipment serving space

518
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,758
quite simply we need to figure out the

519
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,800
peak pounds per hour of moisture removal

520
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,240
the hvac system has to provide so we sit

521
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,159
down with the project team and get the

522
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,680
master grower to give us the total daily

523
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,120
watering rate that is

524
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,679
gallons of water that are going to be

525
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,759
pumped into a room on a given day

526
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,039
we multiply that by the percentage of

527
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,680
moisture that comes out during the

528
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,360
periods

529
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,679
highest transpiration which is when the

530
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,480
lights are on then we divide that number

531
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,719
by the

532
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,839
number of hours of the photo period and

533
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,519
of course because we're

534
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,920
looking for a total because we're giving

535
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,320
a total daily watering rate in gallons

536
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,838
we multiply everything by 8.33 to

537
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,519
convert from gallons to pounds because

538
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,120
we're looking for pounds per hour

539
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,039
and obviously this number changes for

540
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,919
our international metric loving friends

541
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,759
who use liters

542
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,120
instead of gallons but i think you get

543
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,919
the point

544
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,440
the key to this whole equation is the

545
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,639
percentage of moisture removed during

546
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,120
the day

547
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,039
and to this day we invest a lot of

548
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,679
resources to get the data from live

549
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,120
rooms

550
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:00,958
this is a snapshot from one of those

551
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,799
rooms the blue bars represent water

552
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,639
transpired during the photo period

553
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,959
the red bars represent water transpired

554
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,799
or evaporated during the dark period

555
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,959
add them together and we can see the

556
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,078
total daily plant water consumption for

557
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,160
that room

558
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,240
but more importantly we see the ratio of

559
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,199
lights on versus 24 hour moisture

560
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,439
consumption

561
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,640
and this ratio is the percentage of

562
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,679
moisture removal

563
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,600
i referenced in the previous slide this

564
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,199
is the kind of knowledge that is going

565
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,719
to make sure you're not scrambling to

566
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,919
buy portable d hums that you have to

567
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,759
wheel into a room

568
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,520
three weeks before harvest but fair

569
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,798
warning look every room is different

570
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,480
different lighting technologies

571
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,000
different growing styles they're going

572
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,360
to have different ratios don't treat

573
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,160
this as gospel it'll bite you in the

574
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,918
butt

575
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,679
um feel free to give us a call we'll

576
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,559
talk about what it means to right-size

577
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,759
the equipment

578
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,759
for the facility you're picturing

579
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,200
okay look i've gone into a deep dive i

580
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:52,400
spent a lot of time highlighting the

581
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,440
features you get when you work with

582
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,840
inspire

583
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,360
but it's not exactly a sales pitch

584
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,879
you're going to hear from adrian

585
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,199
about how to make sure you've got all

586
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,960
your bases covered as you realize that

587
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,919
dream of a successful cultivation

588
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,600
facility

589
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,280
the features i've just mentioned bring

590
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,279
real value and most of them are

591
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,038
requirements you need to account for

592
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,720
your bids you're going to try and

593
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,240
compare multiple vendors

594
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,519
i hope you understand the limitations

595
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,120
that come along with purchasing a

596
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,679
variable truckload of mini splits and

597
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,519
dehumidifiers for a streaming price

598
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,400
and how that decision will ultimately

599
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,160
prevent you from optimizing the facility

600
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,480
you absolutely can compare apples and

601
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,160
oranges and grapes and pears

602
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,160
adrian why don't you take it from here

603
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,320
and show them how

604
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,000
thank you rob i hope what robbie just

605
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,319
went through resonated

606
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,839
and you can begin to understand why it's

607
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:44,558
not an easy task to compare multiple

608
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,918
bids against each other and it seems

609
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,119
easy to have a plan

610
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,960
of calling up you know one three five

611
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,599
different companies that offer

612
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,519
environmental control systems

613
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,319
ask for a bid review them in a couple

614
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:01,119
days and make a direct decision

615
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,960
around your design in the indoor

616
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,959
cannabis and horticulture business since

617
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,440
nearly every manufacturer approaches

618
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,679
this challenge differently this scenario

619
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,840
couldn't be further from the truth

620
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,720
now let's dive in and see if we can help

621
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:14,879
unmask

622
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,079
some of the details that it takes to get

623
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,120
to a point of a true

624
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,960
apples to apples comparison robbie just

625
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,798
walked us through the process to define

626
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,400
how to set expectations for your room

627
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,839
conditions temperature

628
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,240
and relative humidity and how generally

629
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,399
size your hvacd systems based on

630
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,319
moisture removal capacity

631
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,759
this is a process that needs to be born

632
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,879
from a collaboration between the

633
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,000
cultivation team

634
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,919
and the business team these decisions

635
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,400
have huge impacts on the type of

636
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,038
cultivation setup that you end up using

637
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400
the lighting type you choose strain

638
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,759
choices

639
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,798
on and on and this is why we call this

640
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,919
step one

641
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:58,319
of a bid leveling process

642
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,160
once these key decisions are made you'll

643
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,519
be ready to complete a form like the one

644
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,600
you see on the screen

645
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,599
which is used to convey the design

646
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,798
criteria along to the manufacturer

647
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:10,079
mechanical engineer

648
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,079
and other project stakeholders

649
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,679
as discussed in my opening section there

650
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,400
are many different ways to go about your

651
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,320
project

652
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
but hopefully sooner rather than later

653
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,558
you're going to engage in mep engineer

654
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,798
to design your facility and when you do

655
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,399
so we come to step number two

656
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,558
ideally this is in conjunction with

657
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,038
hiring the other project team members so

658
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,440
that a true collaborative design process

659
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,038
can happen the coordination items can

660
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,640
get worked out early

661
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,960
and you can have your best chance at

662
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,038
bringing your project in on time

663
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,840
on budget and with the right parts and

664
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,919
pieces to allow you to be profitable

665
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,678
your mep engineer who has indoor

666
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,440
horticulture experience

667
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,720
does way more than just create the

668
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,600
drawing on the far right for

669
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,880
construction permit process purposes

670
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:54,719
they are an integral part of

671
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,480
coordinating the design elements of the

672
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,319
hvcd systems

673
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,839
between the other design consultants on

674
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,918
the project such as structural

675
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:07,038
electrical plumbing controls

676
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,080
fire protection these guys and gals are

677
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,879
problem solvers

678
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:13,199
just like us and as a team it is so much

679
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,000
more seamless to get complex decisions

680
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,240
made

681
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,440
like the ducting challenge as an example

682
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,679
shown on the screen

683
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,480
that's drawn with 3d cad to detail out

684
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,559
the all the pro

685
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,519
all the appropriate ductwork fittings

686
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:25,839
and insulation

687
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,679
that were required to get the air to and

688
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,319
from the cultivation room

689
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,159
and not lose any or gain any heat from

690
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:35,279
an ambient condition that can be

691
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,559
110 120 degrees in different conditions

692
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,240
in locations on a design day

693
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,158
since just about every design decision

694
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,640
has a technical fit or function

695
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,000
as well as a cost implication having the

696
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,080
rest of the construction team

697
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,839
involved early helps streamline the

698
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,960
process significantly

699
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:55,038
and true value engineering can be done

700
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,079
where the overall value of the project

701
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,960
to the owner

702
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:59,678
can be integrated into the design and

703
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,880
done so

704
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,480
for the minimum amount of overall cost

705
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,280
slightly different take on the way that

706
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,919
you normally hear value engineering used

707
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,678
but it's an it's an important way to to

708
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,320
approach these projects

709
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,280
now i say overall cost because the raw

710
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,279
hvac d

711
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,798
equipment or system costs that you get

712
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,960
from the manufacturers

713
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,359
only tell part of the story the

714
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,279
installation costs play a huge factor in

715
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,558
determining your total cost of ownership

716
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,079
for your project

717
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,079
and without the ability to quickly

718
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,960
determine what the installation cost

719
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,199
impact on a design decision will be

720
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,000
there is no true way to know your total

721
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,480
budget

722
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,679
going into construction and confirming

723
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,319
that you have enough funds available

724
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,720
now this brings us to step number three

725
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,399
which

726
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,319
while we know that all of these steps

727
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,159
are important this one may be the most

728
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,480
important of the bunch

729
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,000
how do you now compare multiple bids

730
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,839
that you've solicited

731
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,079
when it may be one of them may be a

732
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,519
chilled water hot water four pipe system

733
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,119
one of them might be an air cooled

734
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,960
package unit system

735
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,959
one of them might be a water cooled dx

736
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,319
system one of them could be a liquid

737
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,919
desiccant system

738
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,079
and how do you know which bid to select

739
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,159
all the numbers are different

740
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,839
do i take the lowest price do i take the

741
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,960
highest price what do you know do i take

742
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,798
something in the middle

743
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,519
uh well you really you don't have any

744
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,918
idea how to make that decision

745
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,240
until you consider the installation cost

746
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,720
impacts of each of these systems

747
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,839
in order to get a total capex budget

748
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,159
that's required

749
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,678
for your project we approach this

750
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,679
challenge with what can be called a bid

751
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,000
form and it's hard to read because

752
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,480
there's a lot of detailed information

753
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,038
crammed into one spreadsheet but we need

754
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,839
to know

755
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,879
a lot of this detail about the hvcd

756
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,240
system some of which

757
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,919
robbie touched on but many others

758
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,599
to be sure that the systems serving the

759
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,278
cultivation and curing rooms have all

760
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,480
the appropriate options required to

761
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,278
perform the duty

762
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,880
of proper environmental control now this

763
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:57,839
might be the right type of filtration

764
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,679
and air cleaning

765
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,158
included this might be the right type of

766
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,880
redundancies in different parts of the

767
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,679
system

768
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,278
and units maybe it's a room control

769
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,720
system that allows the cultivator to

770
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,480
focus on cultivation

771
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,558
and not monkeying with a thermostat or

772
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,240
feedback loop all day

773
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:15,759
maybe it's the right type of startup

774
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,798
processes commissioning

775
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,919
training spare parts sops associated

776
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,038
with mechanical part

777
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,640
failures is is the air cooled condenser

778
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,359
going to run at negative 40

779
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,880
in the alberta winter or 120 degrees

780
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,918
fahrenheit in the california desert

781
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,799
summer

782
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,600
the list is long detailed and honestly

783
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,960
pretty dull

784
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,639
unless you're an hvac d nerd like us

785
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,720
but every one of these items is

786
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,400
imperative for your facility

787
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,079
to operate in a way that allows your

788
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,120
plants to thrive

789
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:48,240
in your business to be profitable this

790
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,678
is why we're here for you

791
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,839
and why we work together with your

792
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,759
design and construction team to be sure

793
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,918
that all of the appropriate items are

794
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,839
included in the material bids

795
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,679
the installation bids and are

796
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,278
coordinated together with the design

797
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,960
team

798
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:04,640
if all three of those plates are not

799
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,480
spinning in the same rhythm

800
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,400
you are sure to encounter unforeseen

801
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,839
costs schedule delays

802
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,919
or both and although it is not normally

803
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,480
top of mind when selecting these systems

804
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,159
today

805
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,480
let's not forget operating costs and

806
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,320
potential utility incentives available

807
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,599
when deploying a more energy efficient

808
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,359
system

809
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,519
these may not be as impactful on

810
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,519
profitability in the short term

811
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,200
but will become much more important as

812
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,798
the market develops

813
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,240
and since we know that efficient and

814
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,639
sustainable facilities

815
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,839
do not need to cost more than standard

816
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,759
facilities

817
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,278
to build when working together with a

818
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:40,079
collaborative design and construction

819
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,240
team

820
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,839
why not be ready for that when the time

821
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,440
comes

822
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,798
this whole process takes intimacy acumen

823
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,558
and integrity to perform the

824
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,200
comprehensive apples to apples bid

825
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:53,359
leveling

826
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,038
in an ethical manner you might be

827
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:57,038
surprised that when you compare a

828
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,879
conventional non-integrated system with

829
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,038
an inspire integrated system

830
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,320
that the project costs are neutral or

831
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:03,599
very close

832
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,319
we look forward to exploring this

833
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,119
together now let's take a quick recap of

834
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,200
where we're at

835
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,359
we've set our expectations for how the

836
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,360
facility will operate in step one

837
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,119
we've brought in the right design

838
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,359
construction team members

839
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,839
and we've successfully leveled all of

840
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,759
those hvacd bids to determine which

841
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,000
partner to choose

842
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,319
let's make sure to note that the hvac

843
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,159
system is not the only

844
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,678
part of the puzzle that needs this level

845
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,919
of evaluation

846
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,759
choosing the right lights fertigation

847
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,278
system racks or tables

848
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:39,599
wall materials epoxy floor coverings

849
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:40,880
you get the long list here for your

850
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,079
business model

851
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,080
are all equally important however

852
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,000
nothing takes the place of investing

853
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,639
in the building blocks of your cultural

854
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,240
and environmental control

855
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,080
now that all those numbers are rolled up

856
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,599
into a total budget how did we do

857
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,439
against the estimated budget that was

858
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,759
said at the outset of the project

859
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,440
are we within the budget great and let's

860
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,839
move to step four

861
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,080
if not let's talk about some financing

862
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:08,399
options

863
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,240
we see three typical forms of financing

864
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,038
used in the cannabis space currently

865
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,558
with a possible fourth as a newcomer the

866
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,558
three that are most widely used

867
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,240
are equity financing where you offer

868
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,519
part of your business in exchange for

869
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,440
capital

870
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,519
traditional financing which may come

871
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,880
directly from a bank or indirectly from

872
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,599
a private source

873
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,039
based upon creditworthiness or equipment

874
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,639
leasing

875
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,158
these backs are a model that have been

876
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,919
around a long time in other market

877
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,600
segments and are making an entry into

878
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,200
the cannabis business space but are

879
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,199
really yet to be seen if they'll be

880
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,640
successful

881
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,080
we don't have a horse in this race

882
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,440
except to say that we can help connect

883
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,720
you with some different ecosystem

884
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,278
partners who we know

885
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,519
offer a fair exchange of value in the

886
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,038
end it is up to your team to evaluate

887
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,798
all your options carefully

888
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,480
read the fine print and make sure it is

889
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,440
a sound business decision

890
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,960
for you and your partners to enter into

891
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,960
keep in mind that in the cannabis

892
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,919
business most manufacturers require

893
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,679
significant funds up front and that you

894
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,640
will need your funds to be liquid at the

895
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,399
appropriate time

896
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,399
to be sure you don't delay your schedule

897
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,240
let's look at a slightly different

898
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,639
alternative to financing

899
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,240
and that is phasing your project there

900
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,919
are a lot of reasons why you might want

901
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,399
to phase your project

902
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,360
it allows for proof of concept the whole

903
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,319
measure twice

904
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,278
cut once saying really offers the

905
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,439
ability to gain

906
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,839
invaluable experience and reduce your

907
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,720
risk by biting off smaller pieces of the

908
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,240
dream

909
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,960
while you learn the systems that will

910
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,798
allow you to scale into the future

911
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,399
but most importantly this measure twice

912
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,720
cut once approach

913
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,000
allows you to preserve more equity and

914
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,960
reduce the capital raise

915
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,640
requirements ultimately you can maintain

916
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,319
more control over your future

917
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,640
by not having to raise 10 million

918
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:53,839
dollars to build out the whole facility

919
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,600
as an example

920
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,359
when you could start with three million

921
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:58,000
dollars get operational become

922
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,398
profitable

923
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,119
and then scale up you don't know what

924
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:02,719
you don't know

925
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,239
at the beginning of the journey and this

926
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,558
allows for failure

927
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,919
but not spectacular business crippling

928
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,519
failure

929
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,360
you know it could also be said and

930
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,639
called start smart

931
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,639
so you can scale fast

932
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,159
now that you have all of this out of the

933
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,798
way let's get on with awarding that bid

934
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,039
that you chose back on step three if

935
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,960
your project is fast track like many are

936
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,720
and since you chose a coordinated design

937
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,558
and build process with the appropriate

938
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,558
team members already involved

939
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,879
you easily have the ability to release

940
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:37,278
the long lead hvcd equipment

941
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,640
into production which can range from

942
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,880
three to five months from

943
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,360
time of order to the time that it's

944
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,679
installed started up and commissioned

945
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,879
depending on the particular system type

946
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,038
chosen

947
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,880
the design team can get you to the point

948
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,278
where enough coordination has been done

949
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,000
to minimize any impact that completing

950
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,640
the engineering

951
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,319
work quote on the fly might have

952
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,320
otherwise negatively influenced

953
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,960
now all that is left is executing on the

954
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,640
construction

955
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,240
which with the right team involved is

956
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,919
some pretty straightforward blocking and

957
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,839
tackling

958
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,960
but don't be so naive to think that

959
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,599
issues won't come up

960
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,960
they will you're just prepared to fix

961
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,240
them quickly

962
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,200
because the team can look within within

963
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,120
themselves brainstorm the best possible

964
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,679
solutions to the problem

965
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,678
and make sure it has minimal impact to

966
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,120
cost and schedule

967
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,360
easy right if only if it was that simple

968
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,239
challenges always come up on complex

969
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,319
projects

970
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,240
it's how your team approaches and fixes

971
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,839
them that will decide whether you come

972
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,440
out on the other side with the ability

973
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,639
to be more profitable

974
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,080
or less profitable based on what happens

975
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,559
no reason to dwell on negative

976
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:53,439
situations use them as opportunities

977
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,240
to look within lean on the team and come

978
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,960
out stronger

979
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,960
on the other side

980
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,679
now how do you know whether you have

981
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,519
built a profitable facility for your

982
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,919
business to operate

983
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,880
i'm glad that you asked the first step

984
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,320
is to harness

985
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,320
that data take your data and turn it

986
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,599
into metrics that you can use to

987
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,398
benchmark your business

988
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,000
and processes the most important of

989
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:21,119
these metrics will become the

990
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,398
kpis or key performance indicators that

991
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:25,199
your leadership team

992
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:26,959
will be tracking on a regular basis

993
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,840
increased plant productivity

994
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,038
and expression equals increased

995
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,240
financial metrics

996
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:35,679
in most cases it's important to focus on

997
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,319
the kpis that drive

998
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,840
business profitability things here like

999
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,720
grams per square foot

1000
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,839
dollars per gram active compounds per

1001
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,640
square foot

1002
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:48,319
harvest cycles per year reduced crop

1003
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,200
loss per room

1004
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,839
operating cost per pound are all metrics

1005
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,360
that will help

1006
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:59,038
shape your business success also

1007
00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:02,079
important are other ways to offset

1008
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,798
you offset capex via things like utility

1009
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:05,038
incentives

1010
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,079
and benchmarking your subsystems like

1011
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:08,240
hvacd

1012
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:10,720
and lighting as you see with pounds per

1013
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,359
hour of moisture removal per kw

1014
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,440
of energy or micro moles per joule on

1015
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:16,879
the lighting sign

1016
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,798
and as it turns out that these need to

1017
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,919
be top of mind from the beginning of the

1018
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,398
design

1019
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,480
and construction process so that all the

1020
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:27,359
decisions that are made along the way

1021
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,960
have these goals in mind in addition to

1022
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,759
these metrics and kpis

1023
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,120
pursuing ways to reduce risk throughout

1024
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,240
the whole process

1025
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:38,000
will pay dividends for years to come

1026
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,519
we talk about these metrics every day

1027
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,038
with clients because they're so

1028
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,519
important to focus on

1029
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:44,319
if our hvac d systems can't make you

1030
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,960
more money

1031
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,480
why spend the money on the right system

1032
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,399
we look at things like how does your

1033
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,759
grams per square foot and dollar per

1034
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:53,439
gram get impacted

1035
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,558
as a result of better environmental

1036
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,558
control homogeneous airflow and removing

1037
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,798
unnecessary mechanical equipment from

1038
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:03,599
inside a cultivation room

1039
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,879
talk about reduction in ipm costs as a

1040
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,480
result of better

1041
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,840
cultural and environmental control

1042
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,360
once your operational the race car has

1043
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,079
been built so to speak

1044
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:17,038
and now we're racing and it at that

1045
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,278
point it's

1046
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,319
what can be done to make that car faster

1047
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,240
stronger

1048
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:25,038
more agile what are the five or ten more

1049
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,720
plant you know

1050
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:29,200
what are five or ten more plants per

1051
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,240
room worth over the course of a year

1052
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,919
if it's determined your hvacd systems

1053
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,000
and space planting can allow you to

1054
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,440
stuff more plants in the room than you

1055
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,720
originally planned

1056
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,360
and still maintain stable room control

1057
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,600
this is where the fun really starts i'd

1058
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:47,599
like to wrap up with a few key takeaways

1059
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,319
environmental control via hvacd

1060
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,959
is key to any ipm or integrated pest

1061
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,398
management

1062
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,679
strategy different hvacd

1063
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:03,599
system types provide varying results

1064
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,960
it's very important to understand the

1065
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,960
limitations and risk

1066
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:12,398
of each type of system balance revenue

1067
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:15,358
and risk with capex and speed to market

1068
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:17,358
phasing and scalability and this goes

1069
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,639
back to leveling the bids

1070
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:22,319
using that bid form that we talked about

1071
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,760
i want to mention it's very important to

1072
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,359
engage your utility

1073
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,359
early to evaluate potential incentives

1074
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,440
this is a step that's often overlooked

1075
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,319
and when it's when they're engaged it's

1076
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,159
too late

1077
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,760
to to have an impact on your project

1078
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,358
you want to choose your partners with

1079
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,359
care

1080
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,960
and at the end of the day know that

1081
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:46,319
cultural control

1082
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,838
is the foundation of success all right

1083
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,838
thanks adrian thanks rob

1084
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,598
all right well let's go ahead and jump

1085
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,918
into the q a now

1086
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,639
let's see the first question i'm seeing

1087
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,400
here are

1088
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,240
what are the common pitfalls you see

1089
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,920
with inexperienced construction teams

1090
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,439
what are the pitfalls we see with

1091
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,639
inexperience because i guess

1092
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,159
uh you know from my perspective it's not

1093
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,920
having a good understanding

1094
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:16,239
of the peak moisture removal rate

1095
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,039
that needs to come out of the rooms and

1096
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,519
especially

1097
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,239
different cultivation facilities um we

1098
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:24,000
see them often

1099
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:27,838
undersized as well there isn't

1100
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,838
much um there's much forethought to the

1101
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:30,719
different states of a room so a room

1102
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:33,440
isn't always

1103
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:35,039
full with peak transpiration happening

1104
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,838
and you need to be able to deliver

1105
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,039
hot air cold air dehumidified and not so

1106
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:42,078
dehumidified air

1107
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:43,920
at various different times so you know

1108
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,200
that's that's from my perspective it's a

1109
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,280
very

1110
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:48,719
um you know technical engineering

1111
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,160
challenge that we see

1112
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,319
but i think there's also operational

1113
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,239
issues too we see a lot of people just

1114
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,280
dive in and they're trying to do 40 000

1115
00:35:54,239 --> 00:36:00,239
square foot boom

1116
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,800
canopy uh right off the bat and this may

1117
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:06,159
be their first time doing it at scale

1118
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,960
and a construction team may be able to

1119
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:08,960
execute that

1120
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,240
but have you thought it through from a

1121
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,880
people management side

1122
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,000
giving up people to man those many

1123
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,160
different rooms

1124
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,239
and keep them operating at you know even

1125
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:21,118
peak operational

1126
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:23,118
capacity so or anything close to peak

1127
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,280
you know really

1128
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,358
since age you probably have other other

1129
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,920
things to happen

1130
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:30,480
i think those you got a lot of them i

1131
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,720
mean it's

1132
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,639
it's understanding you know having that

1133
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:37,199
intimacy right and understanding

1134
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:39,838
what it takes to to get the systems you

1135
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:43,279
know the rooms designed properly

1136
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,279
and then be able to execute on it

1137
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,079
yeah yeah it makes sense it's a growing

1138
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,599
cannabis is such a complex

1139
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,839
multidisciplinary challenge

1140
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,599
it's uh trying to try to bridge those

1141
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,639
knowledge gaps

1142
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,960
is is super important uh yeah

1143
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,319
like the financing perspective right

1144
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,280
even if you've got the construction

1145
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,079
team to execute it and you've got the

1146
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,920
the resources to design your rooms right

1147
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,440
are you really going to want to outlay

1148
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,639
all that capital

1149
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,838
and uh not be able to turn turn prop

1150
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,118
you know proper cash flow numbers um

1151
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:18,799
with rooms that are operating

1152
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,240
inefficiently you know why not start

1153
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,519
small and go big

1154
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,519
it's that phasing question or the

1155
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,960
phasing topic you brought up age

1156
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,719
now that's what that's an ex when we see

1157
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,159
experience teams doing this they're

1158
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:32,319
always phasing they never just

1159
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:34,319
jump right in so um

1160
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,320
yeah seems like it'll be it'll become

1161
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,519
more and more important as uh

1162
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,720
as the industry grows and more

1163
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,119
competition comes in

1164
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,480
and price compression sets in you really

1165
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,880
it's

1166
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,119
very important to make sure your your

1167
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,760
cost structure is in check and

1168
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,440
you're able to produce good product yeah

1169
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,839
i'll throw in there just the sort of the

1170
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,320
concept of trust but verify and

1171
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:00,078
and the partners and really spending

1172
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,880
time i mean i i talked through it

1173
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,560
quickly in the presentation but um the

1174
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,680
amount of time and care that should be

1175
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,199
take taken in

1176
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:10,960
choosing these team members is really

1177
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:14,319
should be significant you know you're

1178
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,880
you're pairing yourself with them for

1179
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,359
six months a year two years three years

1180
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,720
um mean

1181
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:20,639
you really want to make sure that you've

1182
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,559
got the right team from the beginning

1183
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,400
to help preserve that capital as best as

1184
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:28,159
possible

1185
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:31,200
yeah fair enough uh

1186
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,879
thank you guys another question uh

1187
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:35,358
are there significant differences in

1188
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,960
hvac d considerations between a closed

1189
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:38,960
greenhouse and indoor facility

1190
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,838
yeah absolutely you know in the

1191
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,760
greenhouse space

1192
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:47,279
you have different things you have to

1193
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,359
manage lights and

1194
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,119
lights especially so you have blackout

1195
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:52,960
curtains and other technologies that you

1196
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,280
have to take in consideration

1197
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,400
you know the thermal load from the sun

1198
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,720
is a huge

1199
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,200
huge challenge so managing that um

1200
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,639
you know most people may not most people

1201
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:05,919
don't have the electrical

1202
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:07,920
capacity or want to put in the

1203
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,800
electrical infrastructure to do that

1204
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,838
with closed

1205
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,240
greenhouse species so um

1206
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:15,679
i mean that's a webinar in and of itself

1207
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,598
and it's a 40-minute discussion and all

1208
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:18,960
the technical nuances

1209
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,119
but one of the interesting things that

1210
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,079
we saw at the last conference we were at

1211
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,000
was the except for you know certain

1212
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,480
parts of the united states where there

1213
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,960
is a consistent amount of daylight

1214
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,159
every single day throughout the year as

1215
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,880
soon as you start getting into northern

1216
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,239
climes

1217
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,760
greenhouses start to become more and

1218
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,319
more of a challenge there's a challenge

1219
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,079
of putting heat into the rooms

1220
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,079
because greenhouses are very inefficient

1221
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,359
insulators so all this heat gets

1222
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,359
radiated out through

1223
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:49,039
the top of the building out into space

1224
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:51,358
and so you have a whole different set of

1225
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:53,119
challenges for heating at night than you

1226
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,598
have

1227
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,358
got it do your systems require

1228
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,440
humidification in the beginning of the

1229
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:01,838
flower cycle

1230
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,119
uh no no but that's a great question

1231
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:04,000
we've seen that happen before i mean

1232
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,160
plants are

1233
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,039
beautiful little humidifiers in and of

1234
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:08,960
themselves

1235
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,440
when you start to apply these brute

1236
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,440
force or non-modulating compression or

1237
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,039
dehumidifying technologies

1238
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,039
or even you know try trying to use the

1239
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:18,480
economizer cycle and bring outside air

1240
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,960
in for that purpose

1241
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,639
you can end up over drying the space and

1242
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,159
that becomes like a spider mite

1243
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:28,480
challenge it's a balance of

1244
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,960
making sure you're cooling the air down

1245
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,880
where it needs to and won't any further

1246
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,358
so you don't have that dehumidification

1247
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,838
problem it's a balance of airflow

1248
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:38,960
and temperature and humidity control

1249
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:39,920
that you know with a little bit of

1250
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,679
forethought

1251
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,000
you can you can get around that problem

1252
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,519
and not have to go back

1253
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,800
you see that happen all the time though

1254
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:48,480
they're pretty cheap to install but it

1255
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,720
becomes another thing you have to manage

1256
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,000
you know you've got this this system

1257
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,480
spraying water into

1258
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,280
a room if the sprays nozzles aren't

1259
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,039
perfectly maintained

1260
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,640
droplets into our plants and now you've

1261
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,800
got a challenge

1262
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:06,400
just like condensate draining uh

1263
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,560
condensates draining onto your canopy

1264
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,079
yeah there's a lot of challenges luckily

1265
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,679
we don't have that

1266
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,400
with our systems the importance of

1267
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,399
modulation

1268
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:22,239
all right um

1269
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,240
another one here are both the temp and

1270
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:26,239
humidity controlled by one air handling

1271
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:29,358
unit

1272
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:31,679
i think that's a mean with one system um

1273
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:33,759
yes we can use one air handling unit per

1274
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:36,078
room we can do multiple per room it

1275
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,200
depends on what the tolerance is for

1276
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:43,119
uh redundancy um yes but

1277
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:45,598
that's the point of an integrated hvac

1278
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,200
so this is integrated because

1279
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,480
temperature and humidity control

1280
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,598
buy one piece of equipment uh typically

1281
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,838
we're talking about bringing the air

1282
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,920
below the dew point or sorry to the dew

1283
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:57,279
point you need to maintain room humidity

1284
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,200
and then reheating the air back up

1285
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,200
before it gets back into the room

1286
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:02,879
so that you can maintain the temperature

1287
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:05,358
because often going all the way

1288
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,640
that low on the dew point means that

1289
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,400
you'd over cool the space

1290
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:10,318
especially when you know the lights turn

1291
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,318
off and you go into the dark period

1292
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,000
because someone flips a switch

1293
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:16,000
you have to have all those process in

1294
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,599
place but yes our units do both

1295
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
temperature and humidity control from

1296
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,000
one piece

1297
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:26,639
great another question here from david

1298
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,400
can you touch briefly on the concept of

1299
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:33,519
reheat coils for dehumidification

1300
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,720
sure age do you mind if i take this one

1301
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:40,318
absolutely either way go ahead

1302
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:43,439
uh so reheat coils are

1303
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,079
recoils come from the hvac industry

1304
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,280
because

1305
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:50,240
about i think it's 20 or 30 years ago

1306
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,000
most energy codes around the world

1307
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,559
mandated you could not use

1308
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,079
new energy to reheat air after you've

1309
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,119
brought the temperature down to get to

1310
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,400
the dew point you need for

1311
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,240
dehumidification

1312
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,760
and so to get around this they were

1313
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:02,639
using the energy from the compression

1314
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,520
cycle and taking

1315
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:07,118
hot compressed gas from compressors and

1316
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,480
putting it through a coil in the air

1317
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,480
stream and we call that

1318
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,318
the hot gas coil and it saved you from

1319
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,559
using an electric reheat coil

1320
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:18,079
basically a toaster in the airstream

1321
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,159
using new energy

1322
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,599
um it's just more efficient you were

1323
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,149
going to otherwise take that hot

1324
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,960
compressed gas

1325
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:27,358
[Music]

1326
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,559
so that's what the typical reheat coil

1327
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:29,598
is that we think of it comes in

1328
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:31,759
different forms

1329
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,119
if you're using a chilled water system

1330
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,920
you might have a four pipe system and

1331
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,440
you're taking

1332
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,200
chilled water to get the

1333
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,119
dehumidification done

1334
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:40,879
and temperature brought down on the air

1335
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,200
coming through the air handler

1336
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,318
the reheat happens using the cons

1337
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,639
conventional loop

1338
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:48,000
so if you've got a chiller making

1339
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,078
chilled water on one side

1340
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,119
you'll be making hot water on the other

1341
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,119
that you can use

1342
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,358
as the reheat energy it's the same

1343
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,760
philosophy you're not taking the energy

1344
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:59,920
you have to reject anyways

1345
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,520
the compression cycle correctly you're

1346
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,760
putting it back into the airstream to do

1347
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,519
reading

1348
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,040
another one here from our friend

1349
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,440
christopher lacey

1350
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,119
how was peak transpiration measured and

1351
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,079
how would you account for pruning and

1352
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,079
canopy training

1353
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,480
so many ways to do it if you've got a

1354
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,078
grower with experience peak

1355
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,920
transpiration is measured by

1356
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,160
watching the level of water in your

1357
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,639
tanks as you water from one day to the

1358
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:26,000
next

1359
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:27,759
and figuring out how much water you've

1360
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,519
had to refill back into your tanks for

1361
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,160
fertigation

1362
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:34,159
and capturing as well anything that

1363
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:36,960
you've trained and sent out to the

1364
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:37,440
sewers so if you can watch that that's

1365
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,199
probably

1366
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,599
you know the most accurate way to figure

1367
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:43,358
out how much water is going into a room

1368
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,240
that ends up in the media and stays in

1369
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:46,318
the media and is

1370
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:48,639
transpired you do that for enough days

1371
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,800
and you can figure it out

1372
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:52,400
the more scientific approach the way

1373
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,640
that i think the

1374
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,639
guys with lab coats do it is they have a

1375
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:57,598
transpiration test so they'll water a

1376
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,199
plant

1377
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,440
one plant out of a room or they'll take

1378
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:03,679
the samples parts of the room

1379
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,720
and they'll weigh the plant put water in

1380
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:06,239
watch the run out

1381
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,759
watch how much water stays inside the

1382
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,318
root media

1383
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,000
weigh that and then every hour they'll

1384
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:12,800
come back and weigh that plant again so

1385
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,719
they'll catch

1386
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,800
the weight of the plant as it changes

1387
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:18,078
over time and account for the water

1388
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,000
going in and out

1389
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,760
um that is a very granular and

1390
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,440
scientific way to do it

1391
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,560
um it's also very expensive i mean

1392
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,760
there's a lot of people you're putting

1393
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:26,960
into and out of rooms

1394
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,359
there's a lot of measurements to be

1395
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,960
taken we use a sensor system inside of

1396
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,679
our units to figure out how much

1397
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,480
condensate is coming out of our units so

1398
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:38,639
um that's kind of an equivalent that we

1399
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,559
found to be very effective and we can

1400
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:41,920
using our particular setup we're within

1401
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,679
5-10

1402
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,960
in our rooms of what the growers tell us

1403
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:47,199
they're actually putting in

1404
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,240
through the fertigation system so it's a

1405
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:49,919
pretty good number

1406
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:51,759
um it took a lot of time to develop it

1407
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,838
and it's it's not

1408
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,920
exactly intuitive the way that we do it

1409
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:57,519
um but we've been able to come up with a

1410
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,200
pretty solid system and so every room

1411
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:01,759
that we're in we know how much water is

1412
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:04,719
being transpired

1413
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,160
and so i it was it was in relation to uh

1414
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,480
pre-construction

1415
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:10,318
and so i think it's it's about the

1416
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,599
question is more specific to

1417
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:15,279
to pre-planning the uh the facility

1418
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,960
and um so maybe you can talk a little

1419
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,240
bit about about

1420
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,240
a little more about the scientific

1421
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:20,719
studies that we've done and the data

1422
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:23,519
that we

1423
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,039
that we collect from from the control

1424
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:26,159
systems that we have deployed in the in

1425
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:28,318
the field

1426
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,358
for sure so i mentioned in my part i was

1427
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,400
talking about

1428
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:32,078
you know maybe one of the important

1429
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,160
things is sending hundreds of points of

1430
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,480
data every minute to the cloud

1431
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:38,239
um the data we're collecting gives us

1432
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,599
back from every room that we're in

1433
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:40,799
with all the different types of lighting

1434
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,760
and all the different types of growing

1435
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,519
styles

1436
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,440
it gives us a reference point for

1437
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:47,599
whatever new project we're walking into

1438
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,960
um i would say we've got it all 100

1439
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,200
figured out i'm sure we'll run into a

1440
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,599
growing system we don't know

1441
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:54,960
um or we haven't seen before but we'll

1442
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,680
come up with a good estimate

1443
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,599
and they'll tell us based on a plant

1444
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,000
canopy square footage number

1445
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,440
how much transpiration we can expect

1446
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,519
from that canopy

1447
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,639
um it's it's funny but it's not about a

1448
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:08,800
square footage it's actually about the

1449
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:11,199
volumes but the volume of the canopy

1450
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,200
some people grow high and wide they're

1451
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:14,879
using lights that penetrate all the way

1452
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:16,639
through these hps systems

1453
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,318
those are different than the low

1454
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:20,719
penetration we normally see

1455
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:22,480
with led systems where you know maybe

1456
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:23,919
the diodes are all angled straight down

1457
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,679
and so we've got to trellis out the

1458
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,280
systems and spread it out but the canopy

1459
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:30,239
volume is a lot smaller

1460
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,920
all these things add up and um we use

1461
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:34,799
that we take that into account

1462
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,358
as we come up with the transpiration p

1463
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,960
transpiration rate we've gotta

1464
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:44,719
maintain oh great and just just one more

1465
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,960
um piggyback on that on that question um

1466
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:50,399
how does how does uh pruning removing

1467
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,280
leaves affect transpiration

1468
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,240
you're taking stomata out of the room so

1469
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,880
you're taking out

1470
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:57,598
those pores those wet surfaces inside

1471
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,200
the leaf

1472
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,440
and it'll typically drop the

1473
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:03,759
transpiration rate significantly

1474
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,639
um but because we're watching the rooms

1475
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,119
every minute

1476
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:07,838
we know when we've got some really

1477
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,000
interesting

1478
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:11,599
uh things on a graph that we see we say

1479
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,440
oh they just trimmed today

1480
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,960
because the room won't go through and

1481
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,720
the transpiration rate drops and we're

1482
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,559
like oh they must just trim

1483
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:20,000
and we'll see it climb back up as the

1484
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,160
plants redevelop in different ways

1485
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,039
and start to flower so it's really

1486
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:25,920
interesting

1487
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,599
uh data spray events right i can tell by

1488
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,559
looking at a graph oh they sprayed today

1489
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,000
in this room

1490
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,839
because the lights turned off in the

1491
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,079
middle of the day and the hvac system

1492
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:37,519
worked to compensate and fix that

1493
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:40,640
so um yeah it's it's basically

1494
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:44,159
pruning leaves takes out the stomata

1495
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:45,679
that are um you know that are directly

1496
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:46,879
tied to the transpiration rate of the

1497
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:50,639
plant

1498
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:54,160
yeah awesome okay so on the

1499
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:57,519
concept of transpiration and and water

1500
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,920
um maybe uh there's a question here

1501
00:48:57,519 --> 00:48:59,440
about

1502
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,519
what are the best methods to drain

1503
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,159
humidity from a dehumidifying unit from

1504
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:04,000
your grow

1505
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:07,118
um maybe touched a little bit on

1506
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,119
condensate capture

1507
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,240
either way but i thought that would be a

1508
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,599
great segue because there's another

1509
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,719
question about

1510
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:19,119
desiccant based systems and and uh

1511
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:20,239
geothermal was mentioned in the question

1512
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,358
um

1513
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:25,279
but uh yeah i mean the ability to

1514
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:27,199
have the condense you know we can not

1515
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,720
only measure the condensate

1516
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:31,439
and the water that's flowing out of the

1517
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,719
units um but we're able to reuse that

1518
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,599
and recapture that

1519
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,639
the grower can and reuse for irrigation

1520
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,240
if they desire

1521
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,558
um and that's that's a benefit of a

1522
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:43,598
system that has a condensate drain

1523
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,400
and a you know a coil on it such that we

1524
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,318
can

1525
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,000
you can not only measure that amount of

1526
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:50,079
moisture that's being removed

1527
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,599
through that but you're also able to to

1528
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,760
reuse it

1529
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,200
which is if we were to want to use that

1530
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,280
as a as a

1531
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,039
point of differentiation against the

1532
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,839
desiccant-based systems that are that

1533
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,318
are out there

1534
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:03,838
for the most part um where you're you're

1535
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:07,119
really in effect blasting

1536
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:09,199
out that um that hum that

1537
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,559
moisture out of the space back into the

1538
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:12,639
atmosphere um

1539
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,319
and that's one of it's it's one of the

1540
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:16,879
in our opinion it's one of the potential

1541
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,318
negatives of a desiccant based system

1542
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,720
um but there's there's a lot of great

1543
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,480
positives of desiccant-based systems

1544
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:24,239
from an efficiency perspective and an

1545
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,679
air cleaning perspective and things

1546
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:30,000
um very they're they're more complex

1547
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,078
um and they you need to have all of the

1548
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,119
parts and pieces appropriately designed

1549
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,760
and constructed

1550
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,640
and there's not a lot of good players um

1551
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,680
out there that

1552
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:41,759
know this really in the way

1553
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:44,318
to fully control the rooms there's a lot

1554
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,000
of sort of spot type units that are used

1555
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:49,279
particularly in the greenhouse

1556
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,239
environment um and in other in other

1557
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,079
locations and really

1558
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,519
in some of the some of the standalone

1559
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,480
dehumidifiers that you see on the

1560
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:55,759
marketplace

1561
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,599
you may not even know that you have a

1562
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,240
desiccant-based system um

1563
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,280
in in your facility currently um if you

1564
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:05,039
have one of those

1565
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:07,040
um but it's uh you know we really

1566
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,480
we see there we see pros and cons with

1567
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:10,880
the different types of systems and

1568
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,800
the ability to capture condensate reuse

1569
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,440
that water to us is a big

1570
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,318
big benefit um geothermal was mentioned

1571
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,240
and i think it was

1572
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,880
um i think what i mentioned was water

1573
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:22,959
cooled dx systems so there's sort of

1574
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,880
you there's so many different hvac

1575
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,199
system types out there

1576
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,079
and different ways to and this is sort

1577
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:30,558
of a

1578
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,760
a detailed question on the type of heat

1579
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,880
rejection

1580
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,040
mechanism that you would be using um

1581
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,400
on the other side of the equation from

1582
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:39,759
you know from the air handling unit

1583
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,838
serving the space so

1584
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,000
a water cooled dx system is typically

1585
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:46,558
going to be connected to

1586
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,838
a hybrid adiabatic cooler plant with

1587
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,720
pumping skid

1588
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:52,318
or a cooling tower plant or dry coolers

1589
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:55,598
or some sort of

1590
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:57,679
system like that whereas

1591
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,200
a geothermal system you're actually

1592
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,639
using either water

1593
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:04,239
or the earth that ground to use as the

1594
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:07,279
heat exchange mechanism

1595
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:10,639
or heat exchange medium that you're

1596
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,760
that you're using um and so

1597
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:17,039
it's we can go into you know geothermal

1598
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,960
in general is a much longer discussion

1599
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,719
topic really and we can go into more

1600
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,760
more about that um

1601
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:25,838
together directly but um in general

1602
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,119
i don't know that i've seen a geothermal

1603
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:28,799
project um

1604
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,160
personally in the in the cannabis or

1605
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,280
horticultural space

1606
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,159
um to date but it def i'm sure that it

1607
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,440
can be done

1608
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:37,358
it's just going to take a lot more

1609
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,559
engineering to get there rob i don't

1610
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:42,078
know if you have others to

1611
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,920
add yeah so you know geothermal system

1612
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,359
when i think about geothermal i think

1613
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,440
about um

1614
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:48,799
the whole point of geothermal is i'm

1615
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,599
going to store

1616
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,359
heat in the ground in the summertime i'm

1617
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,000
going to take it out in the winter

1618
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,558
and vice versa i'm going to take heat

1619
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,199
out

1620
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:01,280
in the winter i'm going to use the cool

1621
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:03,039
water ground the ground effect

1622
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,040
in the summertime and it just makes the

1623
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:06,960
systems much more efficient

1624
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:09,838
i don't know i haven't done the analysis

1625
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,159
but if that really makes sense here

1626
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:13,039
because the indoor conditions don't

1627
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,239
change

1628
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:18,079
in a well-sealed well-defined world so

1629
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:20,078
we're always using that we're always

1630
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,280
standing over the ground with our

1631
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,359
loops so i just i don't

1632
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,040
you know i i just don't know if they're

1633
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:29,440
the right answer or not

1634
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,239
it's a pretty involved design that we'd

1635
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,400
have to look at

1636
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:33,279
but uh welcome to challenge let's let's

1637
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,639
figure it out yeah

1638
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,400
it would take a detailed engineering

1639
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:38,719
analysis really to figure out if that

1640
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,240
if that's the right the right way to go

1641
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:42,078
but site conditions

1642
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:43,598
you know you know it's very interesting

1643
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,318
in some cases you're able to

1644
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:49,119
able to use resources around you that

1645
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:49,119
could allow for it

1646
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,440
another question that came in here is i

1647
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:57,119
noticed a plastic

1648
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,559
duct sock running through the tray of

1649
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,079
one of your pictures

1650
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,680
what's your opinion on the options

1651
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,680
available for in-room airflow

1652
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:09,519
i mean i think i said this at the in the

1653
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:12,480
q a of another webinar we did maybe the

1654
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:15,280
first one or the second one i'm not sure

1655
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,880
i mean you just have to you have to get

1656
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,599
air into the canopy

1657
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,519
um oscillating fans on the wall

1658
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,000
propeller fans they don't do a very good

1659
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:22,960
job

1660
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,960
and they're going to cause a lot of

1661
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,240
stress wherever that direct blast is

1662
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,960
hitting the canopy

1663
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:30,159
so it becomes really challenging i think

1664
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,559
the best system out there

1665
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:33,838
is vertical air solutions it's you know

1666
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,480
very consistent

1667
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:38,239
it is well thought out and they put a

1668
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,159
lot of time and effort into it

1669
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:41,679
that plastic tube that we use i mean

1670
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:43,039
we've we spent some effort

1671
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,358
and resources figuring out the right

1672
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:47,759
tube to use because we needed

1673
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,598
some way to get that airflow through a

1674
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,880
room because it is so important

1675
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,880
and we would just have to come up with

1676
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,838
the cheapest way to do it so

1677
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,720
is it as consistent or is it as solid as

1678
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,838
a

1679
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:01,838
you know rack mounted duct i

1680
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,358
don't i don't know um we have to we

1681
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:04,558
haven't done a side by side comparison

1682
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:06,480
yet but i do know that

1683
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,559
our system works pretty well too and it

1684
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,519
might be more cost effective if there

1685
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,240
isn't a plan to use anything then go and

1686
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:13,920
find something

1687
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:16,000
i mean really it's it's a one to two

1688
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,240
percent cost of the total project

1689
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,318
to put those systems in but it makes a

1690
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:23,039
huge difference

1691
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:24,880
that's what i'd say about that yeah and

1692
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:25,440
you can see it in the cfd modeling when

1693
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,440
we run

1694
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,559
when we run those models you can you can

1695
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,679
in the model turn

1696
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:34,240
on and off those in-rack fans um

1697
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:34,879
and just see the path of air just going

1698
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:37,039
you know

1699
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,119
finding its way around the canopy rather

1700
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:41,440
than through it

1701
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,760
yeah i always think about thermostats on

1702
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:46,880
the wall and humidistats on the wall and

1703
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:50,160
how the conditions could be drastically

1704
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:53,358
different between the those sensors and

1705
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:54,719
what's actually inside of the canopy

1706
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:56,960
that's right yeah we're huge advocates

1707
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:59,039
of having the sensors right down in the

1708
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,798
canopy right next to the plants

1709
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:02,239
um you're really going to get you know

1710
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:03,920
if that's that's what we're trying to

1711
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:06,078
control to then that's where the sit

1712
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:10,000
where those sensors should be

1713
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:13,920
yep yep makes good sense

1714
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,400
okay uh do you guys have a ballpark

1715
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,960
price per ton for an inspire system you

1716
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,960
can give us

1717
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,440
age takes away

1718
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:29,118
um i mean in general you know so first

1719
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:30,559
off dollar per ton is a really hard

1720
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,200
thing to

1721
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:35,040
baseline around and we didn't hit it

1722
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,519
quite as hard as we normally do earlier

1723
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:38,719
on

1724
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:40,559
uh in the prepared remarks but um

1725
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:41,838
you know this is really a moisture

1726
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:44,240
removal challenge

1727
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:45,679
not an air conditioning challenge right

1728
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,838
and tons of

1729
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:49,199
tons of air conditioning in the way that

1730
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:52,318
it's typically

1731
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:53,118
typically thought of you know the funny

1732
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:55,920
thing about it

1733
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,798
you know in a refrigeration world tons

1734
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,720
means almost

1735
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:00,400
you know something a bit different i

1736
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,519
mean you have a connection to horsepower

1737
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,519
of compressor

1738
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:07,280
um and things but um it really

1739
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:08,960
there's so many different types of

1740
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,640
systems that are out there and different

1741
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,559
types of technologies that are used to

1742
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:15,199
do the moisture removal

1743
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,240
it almost really doesn't matter what the

1744
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:19,598
tonnage is

1745
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:22,879
that it takes any given manufacturer um

1746
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,480
to you know require them in order to do

1747
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,280
the dehumidification

1748
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,079
at that given room condition and that

1749
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,640
dew point

1750
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:32,160
a combination of temperature and

1751
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:34,400
relative humidity that you're trying to

1752
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:37,199
maintain inside your space

1753
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,639
so we we we like to assert that we use

1754
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:41,519
pounds per hour

1755
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:43,838
a dollar per pounds per hour of moisture

1756
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:46,480
removed at that given condition

1757
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:47,599
rather than dollar per ton um but we get

1758
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,318
the question all the time

1759
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,798
and it's important to know what it is um

1760
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:52,960
you know

1761
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:54,559
ours is typically in the five to six

1762
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,679
thousand dollars range

1763
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:59,200
per ton um but we're using the important

1764
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,239
thing to note is that

1765
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:05,919
we're typically using forty percent

1766
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:07,759
of the tons compared to another brand

1767
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,440
and so our dollar per ton may sound

1768
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,839
really expensive

1769
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,119
but when you baseline it against what

1770
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:15,279
it's really going to cost

1771
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,480
for that room on a dollar per pound per

1772
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,079
hour basis

1773
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,920
or just at the end of the day when you

1774
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,039
get down to the bottom and look at the

1775
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,960
total price

1776
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,558
we're gonna be right there neck and neck

1777
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,798
with another system that's

1778
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,079
2500 bucks a ton or three thousand

1779
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:29,679
dollars a ton

1780
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,000
and we're talking about when i say that

1781
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:34,798
we're talking about the entire

1782
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,280
the cost for the entire system for that

1783
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:37,519
room

1784
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,640
right i mean we're not just providing an

1785
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:40,159
air conditioning unit

1786
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:42,639
shipping it out to you and saying good

1787
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:44,879
luck go to it you know find a controls

1788
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:47,838
contractor to locally to do it or

1789
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,160
you know go find go find some in room uh

1790
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:51,199
in

1791
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:52,318
airflow devices and you know buy this by

1792
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:55,519
and by that

1793
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:56,079
this is a full complete system for that

1794
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:57,440
room

1795
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,839
um and so i think that's something

1796
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,760
that's also overlooked um when you just

1797
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:02,960
ask for a dollar per ton it's typically

1798
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,400
referring to

1799
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,400
oh just you know i'm just going to buy

1800
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,039
that package unit and throw it up there

1801
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,599
and

1802
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:10,960
you know it's 1500 bucks a ton or two 2

1803
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,480
000 bucks a ton

1804
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,480
i was like well no at the end of the day

1805
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,920
once you add in all these other things

1806
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,519
you didn't have the right air cleaning

1807
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,000
and the right filtration available in

1808
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:19,679
there

1809
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,159
you didn't have the right type of reheat

1810
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,440
available and all these other things you

1811
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:24,960
start to add up and that's

1812
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,280
the importance of that bid form that we

1813
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,798
talked about um but you start adding all

1814
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,359
the rest of that stuff up and you're

1815
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,079
going to get

1816
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:33,039
close to or or above what we've just

1817
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,318
shared

1818
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:36,239
and we like to approach it with our

1819
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:38,639
clients just from an eyes wide open

1820
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,519
this is what it's going to cost total

1821
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:41,358
full

1822
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:42,559
you know for the entire system so that

1823
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:44,960
your room's up and running

1824
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,000
you've got pressure control in your room

1825
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,519
the right type of odor

1826
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,719
control for the exhaust um the the co2

1827
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,960
life safety

1828
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,480
purge that's required by code and for

1829
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,838
for life safety purposes

1830
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,760
you know all of those things are so

1831
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:00,239
important why just like

1832
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,520
leave those to to hope that they're

1833
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:03,118
going to get uh

1834
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:04,719
those holes are going to get filled on

1835
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,960
the project um

1836
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:09,039
when you can really can can scope it all

1837
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,798
together

1838
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:13,838
yeah i mean if you want to do dollars

1839
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:15,119
per ton go to home depot and buy a 510

1840
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:17,279
split system right i mean that is going

1841
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,680
to be your cheapest dollar per ton

1842
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,559
but it's the i mean it's the difference

1843
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:23,598
between

1844
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,319
non-integrated conventional integrated

1845
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,119
conventional

1846
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:28,000
and inspire integrated um i hope that i

1847
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,079
made that comparison

1848
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,679
clear enough i mean that that is really

1849
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,559
the difference are you getting a unit

1850
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:34,960
that's intended

1851
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,839
for cultivation systems and cultivation

1852
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,199
facilities

1853
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:38,400
and has all those other features that

1854
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:39,199
are going to make you so much more

1855
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,720
efficient

1856
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:46,159
and profitable

1857
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:48,078
yeah yeah great seems like sometimes the

1858
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:51,519
the cheapest option up front maybe

1859
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:51,519
you're most expensive in the long run

1860
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,559
iceberg right the ice cream iceberg

1861
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:59,838
analogy

1862
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:02,880
yeah everybody's doing shit right

1863
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:03,358
right i got one coming in from amy brown

1864
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,519
here

1865
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:07,279
are there any specific state compliance

1866
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:08,960
regulations that you've come across that

1867
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,960
hinder the operational planning for

1868
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,000
cultivation facilities

1869
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,880
um she's asking from illinois this is

1870
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,440
this is a great

1871
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,119
a really great question um and it's it's

1872
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,798
a moving target really i mean

1873
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,480
you know we're just we're in the last

1874
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:26,798
week or so reviewing the

1875
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,798
california title 24 um

1876
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,119
draft case report about the projected

1877
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:34,000
2022 code

1878
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,640
updates for california um which for for

1879
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,440
anybody

1880
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:38,159
involved in the building in construction

1881
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,119
world

1882
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:43,759
knows that most fairly progressive

1883
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:46,720
states will take california's title 24

1884
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,240
um and apply that as their energy code

1885
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:51,598
and building standard

1886
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:52,959
um as a sort of easy way to piggyback on

1887
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,010
somebody that's already gone through and

1888
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,199
done it

1889
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:57,599
[Music]

1890
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:58,318
and there's a lot we're very involved in

1891
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,960
this i mean

1892
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,000
so in general there's really almost no

1893
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,159
codes and standards

1894
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,599
saved for a handful around the country

1895
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:08,399
massachusetts has a few

1896
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,480
illinois has a few as amy's mentioned um

1897
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,119
in the way that they've written it

1898
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,159
but more and more jurisdictions need to

1899
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,160
want to

1900
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:18,000
get this done and so there's a bit of a

1901
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:20,318
race right now i think going on

1902
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,519
around industry with within industry

1903
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:23,838
organizations

1904
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:25,759
um and other stakeholders you know both

1905
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:27,679
on the utilities side and the

1906
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,359
you know public util public utility

1907
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:32,558
commissions of the states

1908
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:34,239
the utilities themselves the design and

1909
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,200
construction professionals people that

1910
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,959
are involved

1911
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:38,558
from a cultivation perspective i mean

1912
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,000
they're getting a lot of input from all

1913
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,640
the different stakeholders which is

1914
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,440
great

1915
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,798
um but amy's somewhat specifically

1916
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,798
referring to a code

1917
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:48,079
that came out in illinois that wasn't

1918
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:49,679
even part of their

1919
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,760
building code from my understanding it's

1920
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:54,318
part of their cannabis code

1921
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,160
that basically specifies and stipulates

1922
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:59,199
that you should be using mini splits

1923
01:02:56,159 --> 01:03:02,239
for your system smaller facilities and

1924
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:05,038
vrf systems for your larger facilities

1925
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:05,598
um you know and it's and it says or you

1926
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,599
know

1927
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,119
kind of in as an afterthought or more

1928
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:12,960
efficient alternatives

1929
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:16,798
um it's so challenging to see

1930
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:19,920
uh jurisdiction take on a a particular

1931
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:21,599
system type into their code you know it

1932
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,159
should be a performance based type

1933
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,200
metric

1934
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:26,798
not a here you must use this type of

1935
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:28,399
system type of an approach

1936
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:30,400
because like we talked about we didn't

1937
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:32,160
we didn't specifically mention vrf

1938
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,838
variable refrigerant flow

1939
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:35,440
systems earlier on in the different

1940
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:37,759
system types but they're

1941
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,960
they're there in that you know that

1942
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,839
non-uh

1943
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,798
non-integrated conventional type type of

1944
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:45,358
scenario where

1945
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:45,920
you're needing standalone dehumidifiers

1946
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:48,159
so

1947
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,079
in effect what illinois has done with

1948
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:52,639
that scenario is they've

1949
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:53,280
said this is the best way to do it and

1950
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:55,358
when i think

1951
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,960
in general we all know that yeah there's

1952
01:03:55,358 --> 01:03:58,239
a lot of like legacy growers that have

1953
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,798
had great success

1954
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:01,598
with that but that's coupled with really

1955
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:04,880
robust

1956
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:07,760
you know strategies around ipm

1957
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:09,280
you know pest management control and and

1958
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,119
the rest of the

1959
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,519
other ways that they're able to to

1960
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,559
mitigate their environmental challenges

1961
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:17,199
um that ended up rearing their heads

1962
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,559
through those

1963
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:22,078
through those types of systems so it's

1964
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:24,400
just really important i think for

1965
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,920
for jurisdictions to understand as they

1966
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,200
go into through this process that they

1967
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,639
need to find

1968
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:32,078
real world and performance-based um

1969
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:34,480
things that you know that are that are

1970
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,839
practical in the space um

1971
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,000
we're involved in some projects in

1972
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:39,519
illinois right now where um

1973
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,079
you know our system is just going to

1974
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:45,119
absolutely smash the performance

1975
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:46,079
of that vrf system that they call for in

1976
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,599
the code

1977
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:51,039
um yet provide them like with a

1978
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:53,760
significantly better

1979
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,960
environment to work with inside of those

1980
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,480
spaces and so it's

1981
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,318
you know it's a bit of a win-win in that

1982
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,119
perspective and hopefully we'll be able

1983
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:00,880
to garner some

1984
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,280
some utility incentives as a result of

1985
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,920
it but um i do feel like that's somewhat

1986
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,480
leading

1987
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,358
many cultivators down the wrong path by

1988
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,639
by

1989
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:10,639
forcing that on them

1990
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,400
thanks adrian got a got a nice controls

1991
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,679
question here from

1992
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,440
andy do you typically see all wired

1993
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:23,838
sensors inside the canopy

1994
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,679
or are wireless options available to

1995
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:27,519
provide future flexibility in sensor

1996
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:31,038
location

1997
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:32,880
yeah absolutely we see a lot of wireless

1998
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,640
options coming on the market

1999
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,000
all of our sensors at this point in time

2000
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:37,920
are wired but we're

2001
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,679
talking to people and we can integrate

2002
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,960
with anyone except we've got a sensor

2003
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:43,279
array deployed by

2004
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,838
one company that can communicate through

2005
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:48,000
the modbus or the bacnet or some sort of

2006
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:50,318
internet protocol we can pull that data

2007
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,079
out and use it effectively

2008
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:53,759
i have a bad taste in them all for

2009
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:55,440
wireless sensors especially wireless

2010
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:59,200
with sensors in a

2011
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,960
industrial process type setting

2012
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:03,118
we find that a lot of these rooms are

2013
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,838
very busy they're noisy electrically

2014
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,318
they get hit with spray from time to

2015
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:07,759
time

2016
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:09,440
and there's all sorts of challenges

2017
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,359
there and so

2018
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,480
i've seen them used and i've seen them

2019
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:14,558
not work

2020
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,280
and so to this day you know our systems

2021
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:18,480
we send them out with wired sensors

2022
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,079
i look forward to the day where we can

2023
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,039
just use a wireless sensor and know it's

2024
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:23,680
going to get

2025
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,559
all the things it needs to from just

2026
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,399
being wireless

2027
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,680
i'll tell you one of the challenges is

2028
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,358
we put all of our sensors in an

2029
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:32,318
aspirated box for us

2030
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:34,078
it is the most reliable way to get data

2031
01:06:32,318 --> 01:06:36,798
from the canon

2032
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,160
i need to power a fan on a box that

2033
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:40,079
sucks air through

2034
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:42,639
so i don't expose the sensor to those

2035
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,880
nasty industrial conditions

2036
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:46,719
that power has to come from somewhere

2037
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,318
now i don't have a solar panel robbing

2038
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:51,519
lights from the plants

2039
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:53,920
i have to run a power line to it anyway

2040
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,559
to power the fans it just is either easy

2041
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,798
to bring

2042
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,839
multiple conductors over and get the

2043
01:06:56,798 --> 01:07:00,079
sensor data out

2044
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:01,920
so i don't know that really answers your

2045
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,519
questions there are options available

2046
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,280
i can't i can't speak to any of them

2047
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:08,798
right now about their efficacy

2048
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,798
or whether i'd want to use them

2049
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,880
okay well let's do one final question

2050
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:16,078
and um and bring this presentation to a

2051
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,920
close guys

2052
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:21,920
um is there any chance we can get a copy

2053
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,440
of your bid form

2054
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:27,358
all day sure

2055
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,639
yeah absolutely i mean it's um it

2056
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:31,440
probably

2057
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:33,199
would uh you would appreciate some

2058
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,318
conversation along with it so that you

2059
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:37,439
understand

2060
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:38,960
um how how it really comes

2061
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,639
you know comes together make sure that

2062
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,159
you don't miss anything uh

2063
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:43,679
through that process so yeah we would be

2064
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:45,279
happy to talk you through that

2065
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:46,798
um if you get in touch with us that's no

2066
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,119
problem can i

2067
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:50,480
just throw in there too um look it's a

2068
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,680
big form that we've built

2069
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:56,000
and we're hvac environment centric and

2070
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:57,440
i'm sure that there are people in the

2071
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,239
lighting industry who have

2072
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,358
as much expertise and knowledge on their

2073
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:03,038
specific field

2074
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:05,440
that could highlight and include more

2075
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:08,720
items in there you know we're looking at

2076
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:10,240
the conventional integrated system

2077
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:12,239
and we see all sorts of things in that

2078
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:14,239
picture that we don't like like

2079
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:15,519
you know there's a wiring hanging out

2080
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:17,599
all over the building

2081
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:19,439
you know that adds costs are probably

2082
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,880
not captured in our bid form properly or

2083
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:22,000
appropriately

2084
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,400
but someone else with a little more

2085
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,319
expertise in those areas for

2086
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:28,079
you know wiring the lights we'll be able

2087
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:30,239
to show you how you can save money up

2088
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:31,679
uh save money up front in your

2089
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,639
installation costs and end up with a

2090
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:34,640
more robust

2091
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,480
in the long run and tap us for that

2092
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,199
network as adrian mentioned we have a

2093
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,838
network that's

2094
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:41,358
that's wide and deep and work with some

2095
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:43,119
best brains in the industry so

2096
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:45,279
i'm happy to share that too along with

2097
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,278
that

2098
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:51,519
fantastic fantastic great well

2099
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:52,880

2100
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,279
informative for everybody

2101
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,719
and um really appreciate everybody

joining us again today

2103
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:00,480
um if there are specific questions that

2104
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:03,439
uh you have

2105
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:04,798
uh or ones we didn't answer or answer
