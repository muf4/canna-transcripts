2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:16,198
well I am really curious since since we

3
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:17,730
all have some knowledge on the forefront

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,570
of what's going on in the world I'm

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,980
really curious what new innovations you

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,859
know maybe not your own maybe other

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,778
people's you are most excited about like

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,449
what's happening what's being created

9
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:33,469
that you think could be really impactful

10
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,510
right now I saw today actually this

11
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:39,689
company out of UK it's called skipping

12
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:43,649
skipping rocks lab and they have

13
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:48,209
developed from from seaweed a they have

14
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:50,189
like the little water like balls that

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,558
are that you can actually eat so you eat

16
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:56,718
the packaging so it's it's meant to

17
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:59,039
offset you know plastic bottle usage so

18
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,948
the applications from that are just

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,140
immense but you know going into a store

20
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:05,459
and having a hand like a grenade like a

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,170
water balloon that you can just put in

22
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:11,938
your mouth as in place of a single-use

23
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,609
right I thought that was pretty pretty

24
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,368
cool to see and then there's other

25
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:19,109
companies like company in Mexico has

26
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,920
developed some sustainable packaging

27
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:25,349
that's actually made in the for the

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,349
liquor and beer industry it's made from

29
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:30,569
the byproduct of spent grain of the

30
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:33,478
brewing process so marine life can

31
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:35,339
actually eat it so like a stick like a

32
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,099
six pack ring it's actually more like

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,060
thermoformed so it's kind of like a like

34
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,469
a hot food tray

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,070
like you get at Whole Foods or something

36
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:46,438
like that at the salad bar but they hope

37
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:50,008
that was really really innovative like

38
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:53,879
this product so this is chips chips

39
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,799
board and it's just pressed waste from

40
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,319
potato chip manufacturing and it's out

41
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,689
of the UK too so it's like super hard

42
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,879
but it's not necessarily they doesn't go

43
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:05,849
through the chemical transformations to

44
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,340
become a plastic it's just no chemical

45
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:10,769
additive just in order to keep it it's

46
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,750
just like rest

47
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:19,350
potato peels they're like just the waste

48
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:29,610
from from a potato chip factory it

49
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:32,789
doesn't really smell like anything yeah

50
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,890
let's do that yeah we've been working

51
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:57,389
with a really innovative team that is

52
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:59,969
producing it's needed some work so

53
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:04,459
they're there they're doing hemp

54
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:08,000
building materials and from steel rod

55
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:11,960
replacements to wall board they can do

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,009
you know an entire you know 100% hemp

57
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:20,310
wall board replacement and building in

58
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:23,429
homes so at at a lower cost than

59
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,500
traditional building materials they can

60
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,439
and they're doing it now with basically

61
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,889
just you know 40-foot containers coming

62
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,719
in from from Canada but now that we now

63
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:35,669
that we can grow hemp here you know

64
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:38,489
there's there's just this this opens up

65
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:41,639
so many opportunities this is a company

66
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,769
in California yeah so and you know so

67
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,708
it's an emerging technology so it's not

68
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:49,980
in the marketplace today but the selling

69
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:52,400
point for them is that it's fireproof so

70
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:56,310
it's fireproof building materials

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,890
California and that's like a that's a

72
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,599
that's an exciting space so in the in

73
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:06,479
the innovative space it's how do you get

74
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:07,859
from concept to prototypes to and then

75
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,509
they call it the valley of death you

76
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,989
know how do you how do you get into the

77
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:15,840
marketplace and commercialize something

78
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:18,600
but you know they're working on it and

79
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,548
it's it's exciting to see it gives me

80
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,889
some hope you know that wow we can we

81
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:27,158
can grow our way you know out of this

82
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:28,360
mess that we're in with I mean the way

83
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:31,269
that we build houses today is not

84
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,919
sustainable you know we can we can do

85
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:35,829
better we can build housing you know

86
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:40,329
like this community here is a nice you

87
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:42,459
know you know new urbanism you know but

88
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:45,658
and it can be you know from hempcrete on

89
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:48,878
the floors to you know we can do so many

90
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:52,810
parts of all kinds of our industrial you

91
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:55,449
know processes can be can be done more

92
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,490
or more sustainably and how do you help

93
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,990
to drive that you know drive that

94
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,300
conversation so they're working out of

95
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:04,569
lacy was that are they working at it I

96
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:10,168
don't know just just got ya help you to

97
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:13,330
introduce yeah I know that I know that

98
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:15,490
from my limited knowledge and hempcrete

99
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:17,468
I know that some of the regulation

100
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,930
around building it here in state it has

101
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:22,569
to you can't you couldn't have built it

102
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,819
into an existing organic structure like

103
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:26,319
it would need to be a steel frame

104
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:29,819
because of some kind of fire codes or

105
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,949
some kind of issue with the the

106
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,120
structural issue yeah but I'd love to

107
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,259
talk to em for sure yeah there's a

108
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,889
company out of France that does a

109
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:41,038
wallboard replacement as well but it's

110
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:43,990
not HAMP it's it's it's it's another

111
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:47,050
material and we've done you know it's

112
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,149
blowtorch tests you know for you know 24

113
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,919
hours and you know and how to say

114
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:53,528
mycelium building products are also

115
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:55,750
fireproof yeah like they they get

116
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:59,769
torched they like it's self extinguished

117
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:02,709
it's kind of like redwood yeah one I

118
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:03,338
love the six pack green because it gives

119
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:07,478
me hope

120
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:10,750
I'm marine degradable the fiber based

121
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:13,180
material that has no no liner to it

122
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:16,658
like a plastic liner a poly lactic acid

123
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,250
bioplastic liner if this material were

124
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:21,579
to go out into the ocean it will degrade

125
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,968
so I am very interested in marine

126
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:27,519
degradable its emerging it's it's not

127
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:29,348
perfect it's expensive it's expensive to

128
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:33,399
get that certification it's you know so

129
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:35,050
I am very nerded out in that area and

130
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,689
want to see it grow and I want to see

131
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:41,050
success they're seeing

132
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:43,029
some of the larger my my thought process

133
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,370
and goes towards those products that I

134
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:46,599
see on a daily basis that when I have to

135
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,490
have a conversation with someone I'm

136
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,470
like sorry I know that you want to throw

137
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,500
it away and makes you feel good but it's

138
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,180
it's going to trash that if we can't

139
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,790
first and foremost work the solution

140
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,000
work it out of the system that's that's

141
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,740
100% my you know what well I go towards

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,100
first as the solutions work it out the

143
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:09,400
system reuse as much as possible

144
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,960
implement reuse systems like there's a

145
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,310
conversation in regards to loop and if

146
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,649
we want to talk about loop we can I have

147
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,459
issues with loop a little bit but talk

148
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:18,129
about loop is again

149
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:20,859
but that's reuse but but if we're

150
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,389
talking about product I start to

151
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,550
pinpoint where I'm most interested to

152
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,199
see change in product so we talked about

153
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,350
construction and demolition materials

154
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:32,199
and create that I have an interest in I

155
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,240
have an interest in sound board textiles

156
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:36,039
is a is a huge issue because it's

157
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,379
extremely hard to recycle this material

158
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,410
because you're looking at it's not like

159
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:44,439
textiles is a material textiles has a

160
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,450
thousand different materials it has its

161
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:49,209
own Murph for all the different

162
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:51,159
compounds that poly mixed fibers and

163
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:54,459
everything that's in there and so being

164
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,020
able to find solutions after the reduce

165
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:57,668
and the Rios being able to find

166
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:01,899
solutions for those materials sound

167
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:03,519
board and you know other ways that

168
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,709
they're taking this material and re

169
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,750
spinning it and Reed eyeing it without

170
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:10,539
water and being able to create new

171
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,009
product out of it and and you know

172
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,950
keeping my eye on that because right now

173
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:15,969
a lot of that's not scalable and a lot

174
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:17,668
of its gonna work its way out of the

175
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,290
market because it is too expensive

176
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:22,449
and they're issues may be attached to it

177
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:26,860
so just watching that is so very

178
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:29,379
important one of the other areas that is

179
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,639
a big issue and because is as a

180
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:32,799
contaminant has always been a

181
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,960
contaminant but before the whole thing

182
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,848
with China happened you know we'd shove

183
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,038
a little bit here and there into a bail

184
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:41,490
and we ship it off and it was fine we

185
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:46,509
meaning the whole general market of

186
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:49,240
recycling and haulers is waxed cardboard

187
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:51,250
wax OCC and everyone thinks that's

188
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,379
recyclable because it's a cardboard

189
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:57,309
they think the the container that their

190
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:59,649
their coca-cola or their beer comes in

191
00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:02,109
is well it's it's paper it's it's

192
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:04,149
recyclable well it's it's wet strength

193
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,980
that it you've need water to be able to

194
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:09,730
break this material down it propels

195
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,860
water on purpose it's a design feature

196
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,139
so that it doesn't soak through the

197
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,379
container and break when you're taking

198
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:18,909
it home but I would love them with tetra

199
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:22,810
Paks to which everyone thinks there's

200
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:24,039
like better oh yeah tetra Paks do you

201
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:25,659
have plastic and then they have aluminum

202
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:29,379
and they know a particularly

203
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:31,149
there are recycling systems for it some

204
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:31,899
of the haulers here in Los Angeles can't

205
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,610
take it

206
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,399
but it's few and far between and it's

207
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,990
getting less and less and less and it

208
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,299
takes more energy and water pretty much

209
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,829
to recycle a tetrapack than it does to

210
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:44,649
actually create a new one and there's a

211
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:48,099
company that we met Lance a brand I have

212
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:50,948
to say yes an aseptic container except a

213
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,350
container I didn't know that word

214
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:55,628
but yeah we met a member there named we

215
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,449
met that company at the annual upcyclers

216
00:09:55,629 --> 00:10:00,519
gathering that is just pressing and

217
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:03,758
using the tetra Paks for construction

218
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,929
material so instead of like solutions

219
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,519
but yeah instead of having all the

220
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:08,169
energy to recycle them and turn them

221
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,799
something new to actually just press

222
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:13,419
them use them and that with a loop thing

223
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,609
so the loop things getting a lot of

224
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:16,659
press right now it is I think it's

225
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:20,800
Proctor and Gamble

226
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:23,919
if I'm correct but but if they're it's

227
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,250
TerraCycle partnering with the likes of

228
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:29,139
Parker gamble and their products and

229
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,448
sewing being able to say okay we're

230
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:35,259
going to set up a reuse delivery system

231
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:36,549
so a reusable bob you know people order

232
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,959
their food to be delivered to their

233
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:39,818
house it's a reusable box with the

234
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,409
material that comes in it and then

235
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:43,688
having containers that you pay a deposit

236
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:45,068
for and I think it's upwards of a

237
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:47,620
hundred dollars or something so like

238
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:49,688
right yeah it's it's priced out of the

239
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,509
market for a lot of people the way it

240
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:56,318
works but it's only in New York and is

241
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:58,028
it Paris right now and so they they're

242
00:10:56,318 --> 00:11:01,088
taking it so there's there's certain

243
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:04,149
products that can come in these reusable

244
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:04,960
containers certain products that are in

245
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:07,389
I think

246
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,879
Proctor Gable in that in their market of

247
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:12,909
what they they create of cleaning

248
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:15,909
materials beauty products that sort of

249
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:17,589
thing and it's set up on a system that

250
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:20,559
somehow knows that when you are getting

251
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,700
low that they'll refill it that be it's

252
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,689
creepy I don't know how that works so

253
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:28,030
that was in the the write-up for it and

254
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:32,280
that it's supposed to be creating this

255
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:35,620
loop system that we are starting to

256
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,449
incorporate reusable into that market

257
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,009
that is growing exponentially at the

258
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:42,820
moment then that home delivery service

259
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:44,379
market but there are issues with that

260
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,170
that we don't recognize when we talk

261
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:49,870
about the human the human equity social

262
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:52,000
equity concepts were peddling products

263
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,310
that palm oil products were peddling

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,629
products that are toxic to humans remain

265
00:11:54,309 --> 00:12:01,000
our products but exactly and and so the

266
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:03,549
hope within this system for me in that

267
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,809
situation is you know and I understand

268
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:06,339
people are say but other people who

269
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:07,659
aren't on that zero waste movement this

270
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,780
is a way for them to reduce their

271
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:12,850
footprint okay great I hear you I still

272
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:16,809
think the other issues are much greater

273
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:18,909
I'm but the part that I really loved in

274
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:20,169
the article that I read was I said that

275
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:24,219
they're going to try to bring this model

276
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:26,289
to expand reuse into stores

277
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,269
so taking big-box stores again I'd

278
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:30,459
rather shop local but taking big-box

279
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:33,309
stores and making sure that we have

280
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,930
affordable bulk options in our big-box

281
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:37,419
stores and that we don't have to rely on

282
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:39,639
these at home delivery systems because

283
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:42,939
that in and of self comes to a lot of

284
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:48,610
other issues too and loss of jobs and

285
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:50,680
many other low-paying jobs um so in that

286
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:54,700
model what I'm hoping it's going to come

287
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:57,279
out of it is that if we if we are able

288
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:00,129
to incorporate this reuse model within

289
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,929
our big-box stores but that trickles

290
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:03,820
down and that conversation and the

291
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:04,989
safety conversation that we're going to

292
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,320
have to have the public health

293
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:10,810
department trickles down into smaller

294
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,580
stores localized stores the local market

295
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:14,889
on the street so that we are able to

296
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,160
open up that market open up that

297
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:18,480
infrastructure in that sense

298
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,509
and make those options more readily

299
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,528
available and affordable and cleaner and

300
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:27,990
safer because it's really hard that the

301
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:32,850
Public Health Department on what you can

302
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:34,528
and can't use for reuse it's it's hard

303
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,269
for them to really somehow I guess you

304
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:37,409
can maybe use that I mean it cuz it kind

305
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:39,899
of means this I mean they have

306
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:41,490
regulations in place but they're still

307
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,688
up in the air about them so I'm hoping

308
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,240
that this maybe creates that

309
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:47,458
conversation I have a question so my

310
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,149
local organic grocery store right here

311
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,599
in the corner

312
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:53,519
they no longer will let us like bring in

313
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,199
our own bottle they're saying that like

314
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,568
oh we can't fill up your coffee cup like

315
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,549
it's against health code that's not true

316
00:13:57,568 --> 00:14:01,409
if they're not true that's not true so

317
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:04,318
the health code that the LA County

318
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:06,568
Public LA County Department of Public

319
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:08,429
Health you can introduce you to the

320
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:11,250
woman who runs the whole Rio we always

321
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:13,888
use that section I'm the way the law is

322
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:17,159
written is that the container cannot

323
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:19,620
touch the the vessel in which it's

324
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,899
giving you your drink your food your

325
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,120
soup or whatever it is so if you had a

326
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,198
container and you wanted to pour soup in

327
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,759
it just don't touch it

328
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,438
I've already gotten a OK from the Public

329
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,000
Health Department that was fine um so

330
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:31,620
you want to produce two pens fine that

331
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,409
the drinks it's usually because I

332
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,909
especially like like major corporate

333
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:38,039
chains like Starbucks they have a policy

334
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:40,019
that says they're not supposed to reject

335
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:42,719
your reusable cup so if they reject your

336
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,850
reusable cup email corporate air one is

337
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,319
guilty of this too they like I don't

338
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,319
know their policy but just email carpet

339
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:54,360
they have a separate vessel where they

340
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:55,528
create the drink and they can pour it

341
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,829
into your drink and it doesn't touch

342
00:14:55,528 --> 00:15:00,058
yeah that is completely protected

343
00:14:57,828 --> 00:15:02,308
completely protective what the problem

344
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:03,600
is is if you're preparing sandwiches and

345
00:15:02,308 --> 00:15:04,948
you put the container down where you're

346
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,990
preparing the sandwiches and then you

347
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:09,149
put it over that is an issue if you're

348
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,579
taking tongs putting it in having the

349
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:13,289
tongs could touch the container that is

350
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,989
an issue so do we get over these issues

351
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:19,318
by putting down a thin layer of hemp

352
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,850
paper right and so that the tongs are

353
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:23,669
touching the hemp paper and they're not

354
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,319
touching the reusable this is right this

355
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:27,979
is where I'm gonna be pushing a policy

356
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:30,139
just their adventures in ways so

357
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:34,310
carry the coffee grounds to your garden

358
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:36,259
yeah see I'm glad to have clarity on

359
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,500
that because I never like didn't believe

360
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:38,000
that

361
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,019
okay I just feel like you're lying to me

362
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:48,960
why won't you take my mug

363
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:48,960
