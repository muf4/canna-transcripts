[Music]

2
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,528
we're in the infancy stove infant stages

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,320
of understanding the science of cannabis

4
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,480
science cannabis has been around for

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,778
5000 years we have written records going

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,469
back to the Pharaohs of Egypt members of

7
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:35,119
China it's been used as an effective

8
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:38,369
healer and treater of dis-ease and

9
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,078
symptoms from ill health for all those

10
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:41,159
thousands of years but without anybody

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,829
understanding why

12
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:47,159
so our shaman's our witch doctors our

13
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,170
midwives all of our traditional healers

14
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,269
hands-on healers first of all they knew

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,649
that holistic healing had to happen it

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,670
was a question of what you ate what you

17
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,009
did with your body

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,010
they used music and drums and they use

19
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,358
sound they use food they use everything

20
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:03,058
and they understood that the body

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,460
because we are a complex organism it

22
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:08,280
wants lots of different different kinds

23
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,329
of healing modalities so they understood

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,310
all that but they didn't understand the

25
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:12,539
science of it we didn't begin to

26
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,549
understand the science of until the

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,500
second half of the 20th century think

28
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,060
about this we only started to learn

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,459
about the lymph system in the mid

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,350
twentieth century and to this date I've

31
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,298
had 14 surgeries and every surgeon I

32
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,739
ever talked to I said well you check to

33
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,259
see where my lymph nodes are before you

34
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,239
go in there and slash I'm open and they

35
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,700
go like no we don't think of that in

36
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,078
Europe they ask the lymph doctor to come

37
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,640
in and show where the lymph nodes are

38
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,919
before they start cutting through them

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,329
we are so far behind they don't cheat

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,109
your nutrition in medical school

41
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:46,258
allopath e in this country has been

42
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:48,750
deeply deeply shaped and formed by the

43
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,909
pharmaceutical industry which came out

44
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,129
of making the gases for World War one

45
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,689
and unfortunately for those guys they

46
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,368
ended World War one so they had all

47
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,468
these toys and nothing to do with them

48
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:00,890
so they went into fertilizers they moved

49
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:04,169
from fertilizers into creating these

50
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,759
so-called medicines chemical compounds

51
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,219
that they would treat symptoms with to

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,530
some effect and then they in they

53
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,479
embarked on a four decade-long

54
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,229
mass marketing scheme to

55
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,229
Vince people that certain diagnosis

56
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:21,419
boxes that they came up with such as

57
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:25,488
schizophrenia depression and then later

58
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:30,179
bipolar autism ADHD all of that stuff

59
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:32,069
requires Prozac or valium or Ritalin or

60
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,659
you know so they created this market if

61
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:36,869
you want to learn how this all worked

62
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:38,729
out I highly recommend a book called an

63
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,180
anatomy of an epidemic by Robert

64
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:41,310
Whittaker

65
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,840
anyway traces the whole history of the

66
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,150
pharmaceutical industry what's important

67
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,069
about that to us is that we in the

68
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,319
cannabis industry come out of something

69
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:53,280
quite different which is without

70
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:55,409
unbeknownst to us almost this thousands

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,348
of years tradition of herbal healing and

72
00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:00,689
it's so contrary to allopathic which

73
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:02,369
Western medicine allopathic medicine

74
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:05,430
pharmaceutically shaped medicine is

75
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,280
about altering the body's chemistry in

76
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,870
order to supposedly heal but really to

77
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,818
suppress symptoms and make you feel a

78
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,709
little bit better they're the smartest

79
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:16,378
guys in the room they the meantime

80
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,209
create side-effects that require more

81
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:21,000
pharmaceuticals to treat them so it's

82
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,879
this vicious cycle there was a in the

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,969
suck the sequel to the original Rick

84
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,709
Simpson Phoenix tears movie they the

85
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:31,348
producers went to a big pharmaceutical

86
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,729
convention in Paris and they said they

87
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:34,469
went around all the booths there's just

88
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:37,379
lackeys at the booth there's no bigwigs

89
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:39,329
from from Big Pharma they and they were

90
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,370
talking about oh and this year Pfizer

91
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,659
did this and Merck did this and Johnson

92
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,310
Johnson to this and they were coming up

93
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,049
with all these great bragging points you

94
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,579
know and finally the producer said well

95
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:49,439
what are they done to cure cancer and

96
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,750
the guy threw his hands up and said why

97
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:55,378
would they want to cure cancer so we're

98
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,060
up against a a perception and it's like

99
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,598
I was over at my booth the other over

100
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,609
there this sort of well how do you get

101
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:04,378
proper dosing well if you look at our

102
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,629
video that we created and we have a 35

103
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:10,078
year public health nurse who had severe

104
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:13,289
tendon rupture and had to have wrist

105
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,819
surgery the doctor said well I would she

106
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:16,439
was using cannabis for pain and the

107
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:17,819
doctor said well the problem I have with

108
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:21,298
cannabis is we can't figure out the

109
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:24,120
dosing if you watch our video on any of

110
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:25,439
our websites she's so good Barbra rope

111
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,600
ride is her name there

112
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,850
and she says well doctor let's look at

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,340
what you just gave me you gave me 40

114
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,080
Norco pretty strong medicine who's in

115
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:36,779
charge of the dose he just looked at her

116
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,759
she says it says take two to three every

117
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:40,109
three to four hours as needed who's in

118
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,430
charge of the dose the patients in

119
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,810
charge of the dose and what do you do

120
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,889
when you're sitting on the toilet at

121
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,480
2:00 3:00 in the morning you're so

122
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:47,430
dehydrated that you're dizzy you're

123
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,720
falling off the toilet because you kept

124
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,490
taking him because it wasn't doing

125
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,590
anything for your pain well you might

126
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,110
have overdosed on it well with with

127
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,789
cannabis medicine the bad news is we

128
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,830
have to do the same kind of art and

129
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,040
science of figuring out what's the ratio

130
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:03,899
and what's the dose for our particular

131
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,950
particular conditions certainly our

132
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:10,199
particular metabolism even trickier but

133
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:11,909
beyond that on the good side we can't do

134
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,379
any harm we're not causing liver and

135
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,450
kidney damage your stomach damage right

136
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,370
sometimes it doesn't work it doesn't you

137
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,569
just switch to a different either a

138
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,850
different delivery system a different

139
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:22,829
ratio a different dosage whatever it is

140
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,439
we are at the beginning stages of

141
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:27,689
understanding this you go to cannabis

142
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,639
medical cannabis conferences and we're

143
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:31,469
learning all these great new scientific

144
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,289
facts about how cannabis works do you

145
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,610
know how far away we are from actually

146
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,970
operationalizing these facts the fact of

147
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,189
how the CBD receptors the cb1 receptors

148
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,140
are cb2 receptors that trip v1 receptors

149
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:45,449
in our body the receptors in our skin

150
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,060
how do they actually engage the phyto

151
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:49,889
cannabinoids from the plant and and

152
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,168
kick-start the body's natural healing

153
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,939
processes which is what our body has a

154
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:57,689
capability of doing on a cellular level

155
00:05:53,939 --> 00:06:00,389
healing anything any disease that

156
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:01,918
happened that hits us animals know when

157
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:03,979
they're sick they switch plants they

158
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,259
know what to eat they know what to eat

159
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:09,810
so what's a trip B receptor the trip d1

160
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,800
receptors in the archaea conference

161
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,879
which I really want to talk about in a

162
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,660
second because it tries to bring

163
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,269
together

164
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,030
Western medicine with herbal medicine

165
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:20,639
they Ethan Rousseau you may know him

166
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:22,049
he's the leading researcher he announced

167
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,930
that they discovered a new set of

168
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,939
receptors CB 1 CB 2 dot the only one

169
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,550
whose trip v1 is another one and it does

170
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:32,100
a whole bunch of cannabinoid receptors

171
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,079
so it's a whole other receptor site and

172
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,850
there are more we'll find out more right

173
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,259
now we know there's at least 113

174
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,150
cannabinoids that's just what we know

175
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,589
about we are beginning to understand

176
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,179
the terpenes have more to do with

177
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:43,259
healing than not just and then making

178
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,790
the blood smell good

179
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,560
we're just beginning to understand that

180
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,720
same with flavonoids we haven't even

181
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,970
touched it so we're at the beginning

182
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,440
stages and yet we're we're increasing

183
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,620
our knowledge base by leaps and bounds

184
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,209
in in very short time period because

185
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,639
we've got these great studies going on

186
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:02,009
at blue Tennessee in Madrid in in at

187
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,319
Oxford at Hebrew University we've dr.

188
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:05,699
Basu them we've in Brazil and with our

189
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,620
own people who are doing it sort of

190
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,479
below the radar we're finding things out

191
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,480
every day but do you know how far away

192
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,150
from that abstract theoretical knowledge

193
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,790
whether it's animal models or just

194
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:20,699
laboratory work how far away from that

195
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:24,030
understanding we are to operationalizing

196
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:26,579
it in a cultivator setting or a cannabis

197
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:28,799
medicine manufacturing setting I mean

198
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:32,189
when you look at the big picture we are

199
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,280
so far away from that and then throw in

200
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:37,860
40 years of misinformation and

201
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,489
disinformation that the public has been

202
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,530
subject to because of prohibition and

203
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:46,230
fear the fear factor and throw in the

204
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,669
fact that who sits on the board of the

205
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:51,330
is the majority of people sitting in

206
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:53,460
seats of the FDA or the DEA members of

207
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:57,689
the pharmaceutical industry where how

208
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:59,789
are these poor folks gonna ever bridge

209
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:01,980
that gap there's there's nothing in

210
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,600
place to have that happen well the

211
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,000
industry the good elements of the

212
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,460
industry have to lead the regulation I

213
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,350
mean I'm not a huge fan of regulation

214
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:12,359
but regulation actually will help the

215
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:15,120
cannabis industry because it will it

216
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,069
will separate the real medical operators

217
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,899
from the from the recreational operators

218
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,879
and that's the bigger that's the hardest

219
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:26,870
for me that's what I've seen that's the

220
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:29,639
hardest hardest element to break through

221
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,429
in getting people to really understand

222
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,019
that if the stigma continues I guess you

223
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,120
know weirdy stigmatizing it in one way

224
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:38,460
but then they're very simultaneously

225
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,560
weary sigmet izing it by by selling

226
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,360
medicine from basically recreational

227
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,039
shops well this is the thing I'm glad

228
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,590
you brought up right because I wear I

229
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,240
wear a three-pointed hat and one is you

230
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,740
know I run a dispensary and a Wellness

231
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,720
Center and I work with patients every

232
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,730
day that's really important I do pay

233
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,949
and public education that's really

234
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:59,188
important the other is that I'm trying

235
00:08:55,948 --> 00:09:01,128
to bridge the gap between those people

236
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:03,419
who are into the sales and the marketing

237
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:05,188
aspect of the cannabis industry and

238
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,870
those people who are hands-on creating

239
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:08,669
the medicine and get them to talk to

240
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,399
each other and hey by the way let's talk

241
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:12,958
to the patients as well but my other

242
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,509
corner of my hat all my life I've been

243
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:18,359
an activist around policy so I've spent

244
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:20,370
countless hours in Sacramento lobbying

245
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,199
with the legislators before we ever got

246
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,970
my curse' you know putting those bills

247
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:25,859
together Ukiah with the Board of

248
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,019
Supervisors so I'm a political activist

249
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,149
and I have been all my life and it's

250
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:32,549
sort of like you walk in and then the

251
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:36,000
wink week nod nod is alive and well

252
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:39,028
medical right yeah you bet yeah medical

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,620
so what are they doing I had a I had a

254
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:43,379
patient come in to me last just this

255
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,120
last Sunday a dragon fly he's about 60

256
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,459
years old he's got an autoimmune disease

257
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,370
you can't you drove from Nevada to try

258
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:51,899
to get some medicine here and I said

259
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,250
well what's going on you got medicine in

260
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,500
Nevada and he goes I'll tell you what's

261
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,198
going on they I've been going to a

262
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,909
certain dispensary and I get my tincture

263
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:02,278
and it helps with my autoimmune disease

264
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:04,469
then Nevada passed this recreational law

265
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:07,350
I went back to my dispensary though

266
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,149
there were two entrances two lines the

267
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,129
recreational was out the door and around

268
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:14,188
the block there were two people in line

269
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:16,800
that's the medical counter I went up to

270
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:19,500
my the medical line to people I thought

271
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,359
well that's good I guess and it gets up

272
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,919
to the front and they said no a week you

273
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,550
don't have room on our shelves anymore

274
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:28,259
because the money is all behind it so

275
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:30,808
okay all behind the REC and the adult

276
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:33,058
use same thing in Oregon Oregon had

277
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:35,278
rough parody dr. Christian Lai who is a

278
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:36,719
cannabis physician and has a cannabis

279
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,870
clinics throughout Oregon you may know

280
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,129
him I had interviewed him at the Arcada

281
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,188
conference which I wanted to talk about

282
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:46,139
in a second but he said they had rough

283
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:48,299
parody the equal numbers of Medical

284
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:49,620
dispensaries and recreational

285
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,139
dispensaries in the state made the

286
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,578
dispensaries choose well if the state if

287
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,889
you have to choose and you're a

288
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:57,838
dispensary owner you can choose to go

289
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:00,000
down the toilet with medical even if you

290
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,000
passionate believe actually believe that

291
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,929
that's but race to failure race to

292
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,210
failure exact

293
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:08,219
and now whence the Oregon decided to do

294
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,278
that the ratios changed to 14 to 1 and

295
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,560
guess what the tilt is so for me I paid

296
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,120
$40 I've been in legal since 2011 when I

297
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,250
opened my dispensary and wellness said I

298
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,549
pay $40 a year to the county for a

299
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,559
business license now I'm paying 5% of

300
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:25,189
gross sales every three months starting

301
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:28,319
January 1st 2017 to the county just off

302
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,540
medicine I'm I had a lay staff off I've

303
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,850
had to shrink my compassion program but

304
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:33,838
that's not all on the state level if I

305
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,149
want to stay alive

306
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,580
I've got to get both a medical and an

307
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:41,339
adult use license because what we just

308
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,959
said and they're gonna cost the based on

309
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,220
gross sales they'll cost me seven

310
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,879
thousand five hundred dollars a piece

311
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,889
annually so that's $15,000 a year

312
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:52,350
annually just for my state licenses to

313
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:54,889
run a dispensary is that not gonna put

314
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,889
me down the toilet

315
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:10,020
