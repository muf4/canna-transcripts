00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:11,350
[Music]

2
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:20,130
actually I have a real admiration not

3
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,140
quite like the gentleman you just met

4
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:24,689
about who doesn't watch porn but watches

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,760
strain hunters but nonetheless an

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,490
admiration funny one that was a good one

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,199
nonetheless an admiration for you know

8
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,859
all of the work you do to further the

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:40,020
plan and all the traveling that you do

10
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:43,200
you and your partner and well there's no

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,960
what's next I mean we're having you gone

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
to find cannabis strains well thanks you

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,070
gone yeah well I still have some

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,159
countries on my list but I want to pick

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,628
up some stuff but just look one of the

16
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,479
most difficult countries in the world is

17
00:00:54,628 --> 00:01:00,960
DRC Congo and at the same time one of

18
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,779
the most easy countries we have a

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,609
country the size of Europe exactly on

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,099
the equator well hard because you can't

21
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:10,200
get to it in jail there's also war in

22
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,798
the eastern Ebola in the north there's

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,799
all kinds of stuff and it's just

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,659
Africa is Africa you know I don't know

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,340
yeah well I'm from Africa as you know

26
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,060
I'm from Zambia originally I guess you

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,890
can say but the same kind is very

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,978
rewarding when you can do something

29
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,500
there so we are doing clinical trials

30
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:33,569
with University and hospitals of the

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,909
country with a group of professors from

32
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:37,798
Europe and from Africa we're keeping it

33
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,439
clear bit under the radar but we're

34
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,090
coming out with it very soon why are we

35
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,938
on the equator well very easy

36
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,250
we are 1212 the whole year around we can

37
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,949
basically grow outdoor what we do the

38
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,069
whole year around so I have at anytime

39
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,990
between 50 and 100,000 plants and every

40
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:56,279
time I put out a whole valley of plants

41
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,468
and I make whatever seeds and I do

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,659
whatever genetics so this is the world's

43
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,118
biggest genetic pool I have a few

44
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,040
hundred phenotypes there and I in breed

45
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,649
and I cross and I do whatever I want and

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,259
I put every time whatever seeds out and

47
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,370
I can test them directly for whatever I

48
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:17,039
want to see him after this uniformity

49
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:19,379
male/female feminized the whole story so

50
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,979
being on the equator you're the Hugh

51
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,210
Hefner of cannabis you get to play with

52
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:26,759
as many girls as you want

53
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,280
yeah oh you can see the mountains there

54
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:32,929
you know like I put out I've at any time

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,830
so I got now 20 glass houses with

56
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,540
between fifty and a hundred thousand

57
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,219
plants and every time when they're two

58
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:41,400
feet I put them outside flower them off

59
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,689
make seeds magnificent we have seven

60
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,539
valleys so we're gonna increase to

61
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:48,270
fourteen valleys so at any time I can do

62
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:50,909
my breeding there so we have hundreds of

63
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,800
varieties and isn't it the greatest

64
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,599
thing in the world that the whole year

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,040
around you look outside to the Sun and

66
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,810
it's always between 20 and 32 celsius so

67
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,150
it's always the perfect climate we have

68
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,550
a rainy season November in Ghent

69
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,560
November and December which is a rainy

70
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,590
season but we can still grow outside we

71
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,650
have a short draining season in March we

72
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,590
have rivers we have free sunlight we

73
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,209
have free lands we are one of the few

74
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,700
places left in the world where

75
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,699
everything is organic I use only bat

76
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,859
guano from the caves yeah and I use my

77
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,439
powder feeding that is completely

78
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,660
organic

79
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:33,329
we have a whole community of people that

80
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:35,939
we are feeding we also have four

81
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:38,610
hectares of vegetables so it's a very

82
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,139
nice culture of everything coming

83
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,540
together so though I don't even know if

84
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:45,869
any - so what is your favorite country

85
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:48,150
for cultivating cannabis Congo Congo how

86
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,689
interesting and also don't forget think

87
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,730
very logic Congo is the country in the

88
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:56,189
world you can look that up and ask any

89
00:03:53,729 --> 00:04:00,060
teacher in the world is the most diverse

90
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:03,300
in plants and fruits so that says enough

91
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,420
yeah yeah so the most plants and fruits

92
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:09,719
in the world are in Congo oh how nice so

93
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,488
why don't copy that with marijuana yeah

94
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,620
and we are only a quick look I don't

95
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,599
have the icon grow my plants big so I'll

96
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,040
do that in a glass house that's the only

97
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,048
little disadvantage but you don't need

98
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,510
big plans to make to breeding love the

99
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:24,979
breeding course not I pre Rotem you have

100
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:30,990
understand one glass house I have it's

101
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:33,600
it's 8 meters by 30 meters so it's 240

102
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,370
meters like a normal glass house you

103
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,320
know like the tunnels you guys have 100

104
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,870
feet by 25 feet but is it you have in

105
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,370
America sorry L goes nice through well

106
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,069
you saw my pictures you know them that

107
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,889
they're on Instagram all over and I have

108
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:48,750
LEDs in there 150 times 6 watts so I

109
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,810
have a thousand watts for a whole glass

110
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,339
house for sub sub sub light because I

111
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,990
only put the lights on at 5 o'clock to

112
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:58,409
11 o'clock because the rest is sunlight

113
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:02,660
all day so I use 2 thousand litres of

114
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:04,860
diesel in a whole month 420 glass houses

115
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,130
amazing kind of off the grid you know

116
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,360
we're lazing so this is this is what you

117
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:16,740
had to make me give wanna give up

118
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:18,750
California both why not

119
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,220
like P we were talking about I'm

120
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,259
everywhere you know I love the fact that

121
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,390
you're so dynamic man you know you're

122
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,730
not you're not uh you don't just settle

123
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,069
for doing this here or doing this there

124
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,860
and you constantly moving out and

125
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:34,560
expanding and the organics you know I'm

126
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,629
all about that you guys if you want to

127
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:42,389
smoke hydroponic we'd be my guest but I

128
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:43,889
save the organics for me and the

129
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,259
vegetable so it sounds like you're just

130
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:48,990
uh your your as they say living the

131
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,099
dream but in the Congo yes yeah how much

132
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,460
time do you spend there a year so I

133
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,610
spent one week a month in North America

134
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:58,859
uh-huh and one week a month in Africa

135
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,569
and we have two weeks left which I spent

136
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,590
ten days home and the other five days in

137
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:06,449
Europe yeah it's a pretty busy schedule

138
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:08,129
I think you have the same problem as me

139
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,409
all of us are sitting basically

140
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:12,240
Annapolis yes I didn't even know was

141
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,970
existing but me my part is we have

142
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,370
diamond cards now on the airplanes very

143
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,230
nice so we got upgraded every time isn't

144
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,329
that crazy that's very that's a good

145
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:24,300
thing or a bad thing but fly a lot I

146
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:26,009
think it's a good thing well I don't

147
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,350
know so what we do in Congo which

148
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:31,159
strange

149
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:33,920
I have ten valleys and we created a

150
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,840
system there that we put out every time

151
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,750
one hectare like five thousand plants

152
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:41,599
but we put the pots in the ground so we

153
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,920
pollinate yeah so the males are there

154
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,770
already then we bring the females yeah

155
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,660
we pollinate the crop

156
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:53,149
once we pollinated the crop for ten days

157
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,070
we cut all the males we already bring

158
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:57,769
the new male for the next crop

159
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:59,870
what's another variety we move out out

160
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:03,439
of the ground all the pots back to main

161
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:05,930
base three miles down roads and we put a

162
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,149
new five thousand plants so we can do in

163
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:13,100
ten weeks two crops times ten valleys is

164
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:15,259
20 crops nominal yeah so that's the

165
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,950
first and only place in the world where

166
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:21,500
we can do this so we have 7 valleys like

167
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:22,969
all to 3 miles from each other and a few

168
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,829
trucks and we drive the plants up and

169
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,320
down but this means we can speed up the

170
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:29,209
process twice sure which is great and

171
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,099
then also the finishing the crop happens

172
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:33,139
where the glass houses are and we just

173
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,270
have a huge field there of 500 hectares

174
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:37,069
so we just put all the pots again in the

175
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:38,719
ground the holes already there so we

176
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,550
dropped them after five weeks bring them

177
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,140
back there just pollinate it and then we

178
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,939
just finish them off in the main field

179
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:45,469
and we only have to water there we don't

180
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:48,259
have any cross-pollination problems I

181
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,790
love it it's amazing outdoor growing is

182
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,769
something that I haven't done too much

183
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,720
of I'm primarily an indoor grower

184
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:57,049
nothing I'm proud of I wish I could grow

185
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,850
outdoors I don't have the space well

186
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,500
this is the other reason I went to Congo

187
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,900
not because of the diversity of plants

188
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,560
and fruits but also because the space is

189
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:10,069
enormous exactly you know it's big as

190
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,379
Europe you mentioned so of all of these

191
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:13,069
strains and that you're working with in

192
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:14,959
the Congo

193
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,399
how many of them what percentage are

194
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,539
actually indigenous and what percentage

195
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,719
of ones you brought with you from

196
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,670
Amsterdam well most of them we

197
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,160
technically have nearly all the strains

198
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,319
of the world there of course it's black

199
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,260
congo red congo mm-hmm better is also

200
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,360
Santa Marta Punta Roja Limon Verde there

201
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,889
is a mango Rosa from Brazil there isn't

202
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,500
anything that we are crossing with

203
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,658
anything

204
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,929
huh so it's just like a great pile yeah

205
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:41,279
that's great yeah dream come true what

206
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,319
about on the medical side are you

207
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,000
involved in any with any medical fully

208
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,060
of course this is the main reason why

209
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,710
there is a medical license I mean really

210
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:52,049
in farm I mean bar are you having any

211
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:54,540
big farm oh yeah yeah we well no we're

212
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:56,069
not be involved in big we are because

213
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:59,490
you know that well are creating big

214
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:02,100
pharma I cannot say too much right now

215
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,259
sure but there is people putting in a

216
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,320
few hundred million dollars in big

217
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,600
investigations concerning alzheimer

218
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,340
parkinson and that kind of stuff we are

219
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,830
working very close with this group who

220
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,350
this is just a really rich group of guys

221
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,750
mm-hmm that are not related to Pharma

222
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,340
but want to do this that sounds good

223
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,620
yeah that's actually even better fresh

224
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,590
right they're a little more altruistic

225
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,240
yeah yeah what I really like so good

226
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,600
we will probably announce that next year

227
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,139
somewhere awesome but yeah yeah of

228
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,610
course Pharma is gonna get involved that

229
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,299
what I would rather be done by our

230
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,769
community

231
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:40,649
yeah and that's what I've said for many

232
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:42,210
years is that you know there's nothing

233
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:44,009
wrong with corporations if the

234
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,360
corporations are run by good people yes

235
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:47,009
and we have to work together with

236
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,440
corporate corporations because we sad

237
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:51,149
money we need an experience we need to

238
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,589
know how we need their business skills

239
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:53,699
we need their backbone we need

240
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:54,900
everything from them and then we can

241
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,330
change the world and then we can choose

242
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,480
a world absolutely as if we already have

243
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,480
it

244
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:11,539
