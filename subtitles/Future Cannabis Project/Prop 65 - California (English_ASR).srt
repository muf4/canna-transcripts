2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:12,160
So another example of the pains that we

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,559
face um beyond banking, beyond taxes

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,160
would be we recently were sued under

5
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:20,559
California law under um Proposition 65.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,439
So this is something that no one ever

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:26,358
told us about. Uh, no lawyers ever

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,759
really warned us about it, but

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,519
basically Proposition 65, it says under

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,920
California law that cannabis is one of

11
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,439
the chemicals that causes cancer. And

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
you've seen these signs before at

13
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,159
restaurants that say Proposition 65, we

14
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,640
may have chemicals that cause cancer.

15
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,479
And so, I guess dispensaries were

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,719
supposed to post a sign, and no one

17
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,679
really knew this, that says cannabis may

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,920
cause cancer. Now, that's crazy to us

19
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,039
because obviously people are coming in

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,359
here to help uh get rid of their

21
00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:00,079
cancers. And what happened was there was

22
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,079
an individual lawyer who um went to

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,680
maybe about 20 dispensaries in the state

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,439
of California. And basically to put

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,760
together a lawsuit to sue the

26
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,158
dispensaries and he sued all of us and

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,320
said they came to the collective, we

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,640
don't have a Proposition 65 signed,

29
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,959
therefore they're suing us. about eight

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,960
of us got together with one lawyer and

31
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:27,280
formed a group and defended it as a

32
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:29,919
group. And I remember that after about

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,599
um 6 months or so into the deal, our

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,960
lawyers called us. We got all got on the

35
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,679
phone and they said, "Hey, they're

36
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,519
willing to settle now. You guys, you did

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,880
violate the law, so we're going to have

38
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,478
to pay this. We're going to have to pay

39
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,679
their attorney fees, but I think, you

40
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,519
know, we think we got a really good

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,320
deal. Um, but you're going to have to

42
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:49,759
post like several signs all over the

43
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,039
store. And my immediate reaction was,

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,239
well, I don't want to post a bunch of

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,960
signs all over the store that says

46
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,118
cannabis causes cancer. What are we

47
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,839
supposed to do? We'll just do that. And

48
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,560
he said, well, you know, they're really

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,159
pushing to have all these notices and if

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,000
we try to fight this more, we're going

51
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,920
to have to pay the attorney fees and

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,038
we're still going to lose, but maybe

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,878
they'll do it. And I felt like, well, I

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,799
represent patients. I'm the president of

55
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,280
a nonprofit. They spend their money

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,920
here. They have faith in us. And I think

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,280
for the patients, my worst fear would be

58
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,039
that someone knows a a cannabis patient,

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,640
they come home with some product, say an

60
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,000
elderly, I was thinking like an elderly

61
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,839
person that gets cancer or something

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,878
like that, and they look at the package

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,800
and they say, "Well, I'm not going to

64
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,439
try this because it says right on the

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,120
package that it causes cancer." And then

66
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,039
they could not try it. They could die.

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,599
and that's just unfortunate. So, we

68
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,120
actually we fought the system. Um, we

69
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,679
did have to pay more money, but at the

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,239
end of the day, we made it for everyone

71
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,480
in the industry in California to post uh

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,640
a small amount of signage. So, we have

73
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,479
to have one when you walk into the

74
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,518
showroom, you need to have one visible

75
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,518
and then either on your receipt or um on

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,920
the point of sale system itself. So, we

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,519
put ours on our receipt and and then we

78
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,958
put one sign in the showroom, but they

79
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,280
actually wanted like it was going to be

80
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,400
like four or five signs and

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,239
And we and we said no. And and now our

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,039
thing would be we got to change this

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,480
law. You know, it's it's but with all

84
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,840
the fights we have on our hands, you

85
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,679
know, we'll see when we get to it. But

86
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,519
like we need to come together as an

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,480
industry and and change this ridiculous

88
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,920
law that says cannabis causes cancer.

89
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,359
Oh, I didn't get to how much we had to

90
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,119
pay. You said 25,000. Well, it was it

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,360
was

92
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:37,120
um it was it was like 16 or 17,000 and

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,080
then it was 8,000. Then we had to pay

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,280
our lawyer. So, it was like over 20

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,040
grand. So, the crazy thing is that this

96
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,640
attorney that sued us, he didn't even

97
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,759
have to prove that it causes cancer.

98
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,039
Unfortunately, and I'm not that well

99
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,439
verssed on this, but unfortunately

100
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,759
sometime in the past, the state of

101
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,199
California actually used a study that I

102
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:02,399
was told was by uh Donald Tashkin, MD,

103
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,759
who is a big cannabis doctor at UCLA and

104
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,000
he's been in the industry and I heard

105
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,079
that they he had an early study that

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,400
said cannabis causes cancer and that's

107
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,519
what they could cause cancer and that's

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,560
what they used for Prop 65 law. But

109
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,079
since then he's overturned that study

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,439
and said that that's not true.

111
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,519
What is the evidence that marijuana

112
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:29,199
smoking, habitual marijuana smoking can

113
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:33,039
lead to lung cancer? With respect to the

114
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:36,960
development of lung cancer, uh we uh

115
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:40,800
found no evidence of any increased risk

116
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:43,159
of lung cancer uh occurrence in

117
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,840
association with marijuana smoking

118
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,759
alone. The marijuana smokers if anything

119
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,679
had a reduced risk for developing lung

120
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,759
cancer. Not a significantly reduced risk

121
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,759
but reduced less than a onefold. So that

122
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:59,439
means reduced. THC actually has an

123
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,840
anti-tumoral effect.

124
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:05,199
And uh these are studies that were done

125
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,439
both in experimental animals and in cell

126
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,319
culture systems and for different kinds

127
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:13,439
of cancer for lung cancer, breast

128
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:16,879
cancer, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer,

129
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,959
glomomas, brain cancer that the

130
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,600
development and growth or the growth

131
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,478
actually of the tumor is is suppressed

132
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,800
by THC and metastases are also

133
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,199
suppressed. The average smoker of

134
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,000
marijuana whom we recruited smoked three

135
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,478
joints a day for about 15 years. And so

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,199
what did we find

137
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,758
uh for any category of cannabis use

138
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,160
including heavy use? Heavy use we define

139
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,840
as more than 10 joint years but we

140
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,240
looked at 20 joint years and three joint

141
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,519
years. For every category of marijuana

142
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,918
use the ratio was less than one meaning

143
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,478
reduced risk. It wasn't significantly

144
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,159
reduced but it was reduced.

145
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,240
And so that's what we need to get in

146
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,800
front of the the legislators and change

147
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,079
this law. But it's it's kind of far from

148
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,199
our minds with all the other stuff we

149
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,198
have to deal with. We've already

150
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,199
settled.

151
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,699
