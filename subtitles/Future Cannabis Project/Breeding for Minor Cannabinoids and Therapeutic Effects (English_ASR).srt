00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,109
[Music]

2
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:11,039
so I was talking about breeding cannabis

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:13,138
for therapeutic benefits that's been

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:17,129
kind of my go-to speech I've been

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:19,019
speaking with canna grow I guess kind of

6
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:21,960
before there was a canna grow they did

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:25,890
the science of cannabis and Mesa Arizona

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,390
four years ago I think it was and so

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,080
I've spoken it pretty much every one of

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,450
their events ever since I like I like

11
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,369
that it's kind of a non advertisement

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,960
based speaking engagement I do some

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:42,000
other speaking stuff right and so you

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,009
know like I went to spannabis this year

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,450
and spoke and the people that were

16
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:47,339
speaking with me it was like a sales

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,010
pitch right and I was just there to

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,930
educate so I like coming to these kind

19
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:55,140
of conferences where it's kind of

20
00:00:51,929 --> 00:01:04,140
expressly forbidden to advertise and and

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:08,250
do that rather hear that you're smart on

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,170
a topic and be like well then they'll

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,010
come up and ask you about it right can I

24
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:18,090
get a card and yeah what were you

25
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:22,530
speaking on Chris oh wow I did the

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:25,290
cannabis cultivation 101 and the

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,140
subtitle was foundations of a successful

28
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,810
grow operation so just went over the

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,540
went over the basics and we scale up to

30
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:40,320
the 202 and 303 advanced level courses

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:43,350
and yeah yeah sure of course said so and

32
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,669
you're you both you're a team like you'd

33
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:49,469
grow together so you're both exploring

34
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,180
like we talked about before and more

35
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:54,659
minor can have a noise and things that

36
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:58,920
aren't being read for now to see what

37
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,979
they're we started with CBD it was the

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,400
big one and this was kind of pre Gupta

39
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:10,379
pre all of that so we started with our

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:19,200
CBD work quite some time ago right when

41
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:21,659
the Stanley Brothers yeah I've heard

42
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,799
enough like it's one of those things

43
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:24,359
like when we're talking about lights

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:32,459
like I don't want to defame anybody or

45
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:34,440
put anybody down but you know there's

46
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,420
just stories that you hear within the

47
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,729
community about how certain people treat

48
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:40,949
other people and like where things are

49
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:42,599
sourced from where genetics come from

50
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:45,269
and things like that and you just kind

51
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,069
of I don't know them personally so and

52
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:57,120
I've never seen their operation or

53
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:59,129
worked with them personally know people

54
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,599
were wondering why we were doing it

55
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:09,419
because you can't make money off of its

56
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:12,479
know he's getting high and so like okay

57
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:14,488
we want to breathe for it

58
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,738
where are you sourcing the genetics from

59
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,150
to start all over the world yeah

60
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,700
everywhere we could find something to

61
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:26,640
work right back then you were looking at

62
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:28,409
it there really wasn't you know at that

63
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,789
time is kind of when can atonic was

64
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:31,859
hitting the scene so I would say that

65
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:35,370
was the other like real major thing then

66
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:39,890
he had to whose tsk out of Colorado and

67
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:42,989
he was doing his like MiG's County

68
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:45,719
railroad him crosses with some OG Kush

69
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,569
kind of stuff and that's your your whoo

70
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,750
and your r4 kind of that's where that

71
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:53,430
came from so there's like these little

72
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,189
little lights started lighting up and

73
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,189
there is probably I mean at that time

74
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:01,020
there was probably four people in the

75
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:03,300
world outside of Israel that we're

76
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:07,689
really working on anything

77
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,330
centric so it wasn't it is like you

78
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:11,889
could just go and buy CBD genetics right

79
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,560
you had to look for it in different

80
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:17,379
places and and the issue with that is

81
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,120
the only way you're going to know beyond

82
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:22,180
a shadow of a doubt whether a CBD and

83
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,699
they're not are lab tests right and so

84
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,500
labs analytical testing labs in Oregon

85
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,149
weren't really like popping up weren't

86
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,079
really a thing you know they had very

87
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:34,560
limited it was only like sunrise for the

88
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,560
longest time

89
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,470
yeah I mean five years ago when we

90
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,000
started getting really good data back on

91
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,390
our plants that Slocombe like the labs

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,160
really got their shit figured out right

93
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:51,610
up until that point it was just kind of

94
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,080
going based off effect there's a lot of

95
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,129
cannabis in the world and not very much

96
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:56,109
of it gets tested

97
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:57,969
all right fine CBD in places you don't

98
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:05,199
expect to yeah and that's where a lot of

99
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:19,660
its come from and so what uh like what

100
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:23,259
do you explore right yeah they're all

101
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,360
important and they all have and there's

102
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:27,099
unknowns undiscovered one of the things

103
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,949
I got to talk about in my speech it's

104
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:34,270
the first time my company's allowed me

105
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:38,079
to share data like raw data and we're

106
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:39,250
finding everything from you know CBC is

107
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,930
something we've been working really

108
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,350
heavily on we're showing great

109
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:47,259
expression in CB c CB c is a neuro

110
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,370
protectant and also has been shown to

111
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:51,370
reverse some damage caused by

112
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:54,430
neurodegenerative diseases so that one's

113
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,879
been really primary for us looking into

114
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,050
based on some family histories and

115
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,409
grandparents with Alzheimer's and stuff

116
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,478
it's it's an important one so I mean

117
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,630
that's as far as that one goes I feel

118
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:13,569
like we've got that pretty if not nailed

119
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:15,639
down right there THC V for people with

120
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:16,399
diabetes dietary supplements things like

121
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,139
that is something

122
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,319
we're looking into but what's

123
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:23,210
interesting is we're doing these HPLC

124
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,860
studies and looking at the things we're

125
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:27,589
coming up with a lot of spikes there's

126
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,919
there's commercially available standards

127
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:32,149
right and this is kind of the the

128
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,519
notebook of what they say here's the

129
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:37,779
cannabinoids that are in cannabis and if

130
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:39,918
they haven't been able to say that this

131
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:42,739
cannabinoid is this and they haven't

132
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,779
done molecular analysis on it and like

133
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,280
gotten a reading on it and have been

134
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,918
able to reverse-engineer and turning

135
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:51,739
into a standard then it just kind of

136
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:55,009
gets swept under the rug and so far we

137
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:58,069
found nine unidentified spikes so

138
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:59,629
cannabinoids that don't have a standard

139
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:02,180
for them so nobody really knows what

140
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:04,100
they are and women bottom limit to the

141
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,350
testing so if there's you know an

142
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,389
infinitesimally small amount of some

143
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,849
cannabinoid and there's typical testing

144
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:12,019
equipment can't even find it so why

145
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:14,990
would they make a standard for it

146
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:16,758
nobody's going to buy has to be um but

147
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,400
when we start talking about therapeutic

148
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,930
doses of things a lot of times those

149
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,939
things especially in conjunction with

150
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:26,300
each other do create a therapeutic dose

151
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:27,889
and what you're using so us and with the

152
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,288
company that we're working with we have

153
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:32,300
a partnership agreement with

154
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:36,319
texas-arlington shimasu laboratory there

155
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,120
and we're looking at compounds down to

156
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,389
the quadrillion from the plant so we can

157
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:45,470
look at it really deep and so we're

158
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:45,469
[Music]

159
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:54,348
right it's one of seven right it's one

160
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,639
of seven labs in the world it's able to

161
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:58,430
do that

162
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:01,189
and so we're going to quantify what

163
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,959
these are where they work do some

164
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,779
studies see what they have they affect

165
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,310
the human body and try to figure out

166
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:10,549
what they do and why they're important

167
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,348
in the cannabis plant so it's it's hard

168
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,610
to say you know I want to breed for this

169
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:15,199
specific hand but no matter when this

170
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,169
cannabinoid doesn't have a name you know

171
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:24,560
or so the ones that we do know what they

172
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:27,799
do CBD VA THC V a and C BC and CB CL and

173
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,848
C BCT were doing very well on breeding

174
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,190
higher concentrations of those and

175
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:34,740
it's um we're also doing a very good job

176
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:37,709
of breeding unknown cannabinoids into

177
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,629
plants yeah and we're seeing

178
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:41,758
considerable spikes like a pretty good

179
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:44,850
surface area in the plant that is this

180
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,860
cannabinoid and you know the way the way

181
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,509
you can really tell whether it's just a

182
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,269
booger on the machine or a cannabinoids

183
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:53,009
through decarboxylation experiments so

184
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:55,110
we can decarboxylate them we'll watch

185
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:57,449
the acid fall off it'll move positions

186
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,919
and it's telling us you know this is a

187
00:08:57,448 --> 00:09:01,169
cannabinoid it's acting like a

188
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:04,078
cannabinoid so we need to have them

189
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:05,909
reverse engineered and so we're learning

190
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:08,099
we're learning a lot but we're kind of

191
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:19,828
pushing the envelope on what there is

192
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:23,339
and then it's not just right yeah in the

193
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:25,679
past few months five months we've

194
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:29,519
accomplished more with breeding than we

195
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:31,979
have probably in our entire careers just

196
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,649
because of the amount of information and

197
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,399
data we have we can go through a hundred

198
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:41,179
two hundred plants a day and get data on

199
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,889
that many plants and I can just run just

200
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:46,169
huge seed pops and run through

201
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:47,610
everything and only pick out the

202
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:50,490
interesting stuff and only work with

203
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,438
that whereas before maybe we had twenty

204
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,850
a hundred seeds of something we pop it

205
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:55,318
all out and you just roll the dice and

206
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,778
hope the one that you pick was the one

207
00:09:55,318 --> 00:10:02,099
you were looking for right so the the

208
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:04,350
jumping technology is huge and it really

209
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,379
just streamlines our ability to just

210
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:19,170
tear through plants and find exactly

211
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:21,360
what we're looking for right I can get

212
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:23,278
pretty good readings on plants as soon

213
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,810
as leaves get to maturity so about seven

214
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:26,610
sets of leaves we can get a really good

215
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:28,500
idea of where the synthases are dumping

216
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,589
into the cannabinoids and so I can cull

217
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,828
by then so I can just cycle plants

218
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,829
through

219
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:42,740
work with people like that why she's so

220
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,350
awesome to me is cuz she can park

221
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,680
genetics right she can put a genetic in

222
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:51,409
a state where it can sit and so that

223
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:54,229
particular phenotype of that genotype I

224
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:55,250
can put into a genetic storage and just

225
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,750
because I don't need it right now

226
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,629
doesn't mean that I don't want to hold

227
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:02,899
on to it but the issue is is space we

228
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:04,490
can't have 50 thousand plants just

229
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,600
sitting there that we're not growing but

230
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,879
if I can put it in a small little

231
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,600
container and have it sit inside of a

232
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:14,149
case right then I can start to justify

233
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,769
that we have tons of data stored so we

234
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:17,778
might as well have the genetics stored

235
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:20,149
as well if there's something that right

236
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:21,588
doesn't look important now but you know

237
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:23,929
how many times does it happened to

238
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:25,310
either one of us that we don't have a

239
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:26,479
genetic around anymore and for some

240
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,609
reason down the road you find there's

241
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,870
something unique or desirable about it

242
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,810
and it's gone it's gone

243
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,970
yeah and also it's really important to

244
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:39,319
you know cannabinoids or cannabinoids

245
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,879
THC THC and CBD CBD but the effects and

246
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,190
the medical value you're really getting

247
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,838
from a lot of the plants may not even

248
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,459
lie in cannabinoids I mean we're

249
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,649
learning so much knew about the

250
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:55,489
flavonoids that exist in cannabis plants

251
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:58,490
and the anthocyanins and no and there's

252
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:00,230
10,000 naturally 10,000 plus naturally

253
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,120
existing flavonoids in the plant world

254
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,970
cannabis has quite a few of them

255
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,720
cannabis is also unique in that it has

256
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:11,269
three flavonoids canif flavin a can of

257
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,028
five and B and probably soon to be named

258
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:18,259
canna flavin see that are unique to the

259
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:21,909
cannabis plant and ask somebody what are

260
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:21,909
the medical benefits canna flavin a

261
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:51,528
like an ethyl alcohol fo ethylene I mean

262
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:54,219
we do we have done some terpene tests

263
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:59,110
where we have what's it French show

264
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:05,240
something athlean show up in it yeah

265
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:09,709
implant ethylenes hormone so might be

266
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:12,470
what he's talking about French she just

267
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:14,448
got back to me phenol which makes up

268
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:18,860
half the trichome head is what he is

269
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:21,078
talking about and then terpenes the same

270
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,990
way right terpenes have been a lot more

271
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:25,789
researched so you can go to pubmed and

272
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,089
look up at ER p and see what its medical

273
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:31,219
benefits are but finding unique terpene

274
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:33,920
and flavonoid combinations and plants

275
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,800
for specific conditions and things like

276
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,889
that i think that in the cannabinoids

277
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:41,599
that people aren't looking at are really

278
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:44,058
what defines what a strain is and what

279
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,129
it can do and I don't think until people

280
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:48,558
truly understand that part of it you're

281
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:51,110
just still gonna be on this well I want

282
00:13:48,558 --> 00:13:53,328
the stuff that tests 30 percent THC you

283
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,278
know or I want the highest testing CBD

284
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:57,318
plant there is when that's just a

285
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,879
therapeutic dose so that's gonna be a

286
00:13:57,318 --> 00:14:00,139
therapeutic dose it doesn't matter how

287
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,149
much percentage is in the plan it

288
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,009
matters what's with it you know and it's

289
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:06,620
really important for us to find those

290
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,629
molecules figure out what they do trace

291
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,360
them through the human body how do they

292
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:13,789
react with us what is it doing for us

293
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,699
and then that can help us with selective

294
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:18,110
breeding processes to know that okay we

295
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:20,599
want to build we want to breed a plant

296
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,459
that's high in this so with hope with

297
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,990
the ability to store plants maybe

298
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:26,028
there's something I'm missing in a bunch

299
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:29,360
of these plants and I don't want to

300
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:30,889
throw them away because who knows when I

301
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,740
want to go back to it and it's a lot

302
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:35,389
easier to save it when you have it then

303
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,909
try to refined it because a lot of times

304
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:40,178
it's like a needle in ten haystacks you

305
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:40,178
know

306
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:50,320
we work for zet therapeutics so we're a

307
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:53,500
research and development company and so

308
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,810
we do genetic breeding and then looking

309
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,850
at all of the genetics and then Chris

310
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:59,139
does a lot of the heavy lifting as far

311
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,960
as like growing them out for

312
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:04,360
phenotypical expression and finding what

313
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:07,600
kind of lighting and conditions and how

314
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:13,149
they grow best and so Chris and I have

315
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:15,850
been working together notice that

316
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:21,250
they're better in this climate or with

317
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:23,740
these lights or I have you know most of

318
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,750
my experience has been with THC I've

319
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,490
grown thousands and thousands of

320
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:31,960
different THC cultivars so I definitely

321
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:33,879
learned how they act in different

322
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,980
lighting and heating in environments and

323
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:40,360
stuff and now we're using some of those

324
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:43,480
THC cultivars to cross in with CBD to

325
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,759
create hemp strains but what we're going

326
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,950
to be looking at is using different

327
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:53,049
light spectrums to compare the test

328
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,850
results to see what cannabinoid

329
00:15:53,049 --> 00:16:00,669
production we get using different

330
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:04,350
spectrums well we know that UV is

331
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:07,149
responsible for the creation of

332
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:10,210
cannabinoids in the plants so like

333
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,919
specifically UVB when put on to a plant

334
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,870
in a higher concentration that it's

335
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,000
normal will increase your THC a

336
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:21,070
production in the plant because THC a

337
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,750
protects the plant from UVB example yeah

338
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,060
some applications of you via different

339
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:28,240
for different intensities at different

340
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:30,489
times would be one thing and then we'll

341
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,460
experiment with want to experiment with

342
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:39,330
more full-spectrum light that's outside

343
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:39,330
the par range blue light green light

344
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:51,289
what's kind of some more modern research

345
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:53,129
the new research which is that green

346
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:54,988
like because people always say like

347
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:57,329
green doesn't do anything right so it's

348
00:16:54,989 --> 00:17:00,089
kind of like actually it does then what

349
00:16:57,328 --> 00:17:02,278
do you what do you think green does well

350
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:05,189
I don't know but I want to find out yeah

351
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:07,798
and I know that a lot of the LEDs were

352
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:09,538
have been missing the green spectrum in

353
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:14,308
the past and they've come a long ways

354
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:16,828
now but no we need some analytical data

355
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:18,778
and so it'll be exciting to find out

356
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:22,500
something we've been wanting to do for a

357
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:25,138
long time right and in not just lighting

358
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,078
you know feeding like what

359
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:39,000
concentrations of different nutrients

360
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:41,819
are you giving the plants we've always

361
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,829
preferred soil we think soil as far as

362
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:48,148
growing a smokeable plant grows the

363
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:49,558
highest quality plants now as far as you

364
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:50,969
can't beat the interactions that are

365
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:52,980
happening with the plant in the soil

366
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,569
same way you can't beat the light that

367
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,659
comes from the Sun because it's the

368
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:59,908
plant as evolved to live in Earth

369
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,470
Earth's environment so the closer we

370
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:06,000
come to mimicking that so your

371
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:08,940
preference is to grow outdoors well with

372
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,788
some in soil yeah but nobody wants to

373
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,980
grow outdoors no I mean I'm sure some

374
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:16,200
people probably do Yeah right

375
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,639
but you got to think of things there's

376
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,269
going to be interactions that are going

377
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,668
to be missed

378
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:23,130
so flavonoids play a role in

379
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:25,559
communicating between microorganisms and

380
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:30,510
in the root biome of the plant so you

381
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:33,269
can have a flavonoid that talks to to

382
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:35,009
these microorganisms and tells them we

383
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:37,409
need more nitrogen and it will increase

384
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:39,690
nitrogen uptake well how do you do that

385
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:44,250
in a hydroponic system that doesn't have

386
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:46,080
the microbes creating that that web so I

387
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:49,079
just feel like you miss out on a lot I

388
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:51,148
think you can grow some real good hydro

389
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,250
smoke but I think you're missing out on

390
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:55,979
a lot of the things that people aren't

391
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,200
paying attention to that really give the

392
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,149
plant it's like well-rounded amazing

393
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,620
effects and beyond that therapeutic and

394
00:19:00,148 --> 00:19:04,069
medical

395
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:08,209
facts and benefits so one of the things

396
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:10,339
I asked the light scientist guy like I I

397
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,920
was working at a nursery for a while

398
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:15,439
in Carpinteria and we wanted to test

399
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,090
supplemental so it was greenhouse but we

400
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,470
wanted to have supplemental lighting on

401
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,139
the mom stock and then kind of

402
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:24,890
experimenting with like art with

403
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:28,340
different parts of the color spectrum be

404
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,890
conducive to like you know let's say you

405
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:33,109
get 25 clippings a week from a mom right

406
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,570
could you could you increase it to 30 30

407
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:38,299
foot light how much could you increase

408
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:42,069
the number you could click each week

409
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:46,069
based on sure something with light any

410
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:47,779
research on that we haven't yet also

411
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:50,869
when you're talking about things like

412
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:52,849
flavonoids and anthocyanins they they're

413
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:55,099
responsible for the nodular growth of

414
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:57,740
plants right so if you're doing

415
00:19:55,099 --> 00:20:00,799
something that is setting off that that

416
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:02,960
chain reaction of flavonoids in the

417
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,599
plant that's creating nodular growth and

418
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,740
you can do that using light manipulation

419
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,539
yeah absolutely

420
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,289
you could find the light spectrum that

421
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:14,178
works with that but like that's all it's

422
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:15,799
all a possibility right and until we

423
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,990
really get into it and start looking at

424
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:20,359
these different molecules what reactions

425
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,569
are causing them to appear and what

426
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,919
functions they're serving in the plant

427
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:27,289
it's going to be hard to say but it's

428
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,880
all of these things we're talking about

429
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:32,359
don't exist in the plant for human

430
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,010
beings right THC CBD all the way down to

431
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:36,259
the small things they're all a function

432
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:39,259
of the plant and so it's doing something

433
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:41,660
to help the plant grow or help the plant

434
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:43,640
repel pests or help the plant bring

435
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,710
animals into eat them to spread the seed

436
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,040
you know it's all part of the plants

437
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,990
process ease to live and it just turns

438
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,869
out that they have great the side effect

439
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,970
is they have great benefit to humans so

440
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:59,539
now it's putting the two pieces together

441
00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:01,220
of synergistically well if we can do

442
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:02,690
this to the plant we can manipulate it

443
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,819
with this kind of nutrients or these

444
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,220
kind of lights to make an extra

445
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:10,399
expression of this or that in the plant

446
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,980
we can really kind of dial in grows to

447
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,860
specifically highlight and pull out

448
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,099
higher

449
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:19,349
levels of those you know terpenes and

450
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:21,209
flavonoids and even connect cannabinoids

451
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:23,539
that we're looking at and we're also

452
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:26,519
going to do some experiments with

453
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:31,399
introducing different microbes to the

454
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:31,400
root zone instead of are you targeting

455
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:39,360
well yes but there's all there's a

456
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:40,410
there's a lot of them I mean yeah

457
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:48,029
there's just a lot of them suitable

458
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:49,440
Pseudomonas and hmm yeah there's people

459
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:56,668
on the market saying right now that

460
00:21:49,440 --> 00:22:00,480
certain microbes are there strep toe I

461
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:04,100
forget which one they're saying that

462
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,079
they yeah streptomyces that's the one

463
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:08,909
increases CBD production and decreases

464
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,069
THC production so that's something we

465
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,150
definitely want to play with and and see

466
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:14,789
it in our own hands because they're

467
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:17,280
claiming pretty outrageous things they

468
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:19,259
are outrageous claims but it's very

469
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:28,019
possible you know and there's probably a

470
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:30,058
basis to the claim well THC like I said

471
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:31,980
has to like this is a problem that we're

472
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:35,819
having with hemp legislation right is

473
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:39,029
that THC a has to exist in the plant THC

474
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:40,980
a is a UVB protection and 3% of all

475
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:43,079
light from the Sun is UVB without that

476
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:47,190
protector and the Sun will cook the

477
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:48,149
plant it will die so the idea of well

478
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,269
I've got to plant the test

479
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:53,759
non-detectable THC yeah you know it's in

480
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:55,139
there trust me cuz it has to be you know

481
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,759
it was like a human being you couldn't

482
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,020
just be like I don't like my white blood

483
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,679
cells I want to get rid of them like

484
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:02,849
good luck with that

485
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,769
right so trying to talk to them about

486
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:06,569
well yeah if your concentrations of all

487
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:08,220
cannabinoids are very low yes maybe

488
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:10,409
it'll come up non-detectable but it's

489
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,000
you know maybe you need ten times more

490
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:14,130
plant material to make the same amount

491
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,440
of oil as this very high testing plant

492
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:18,240
and CBD with a little bit more THC but

493
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,900
your oils aren't gonna come out around

494
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,990
the same concentration of THC a or THC

495
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,210
delta-9

496
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:30,399
you know it's just the way that it is it

497
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:33,819
can't exist without it yes so everybody

498
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:35,109
tell the USDA not to make testing hemp

499
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:36,460
testing right now they're talking about

500
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:39,308
making hemp testing after

501
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,548
decarboxylation so you'd be looking at

502
00:23:39,308 --> 00:23:44,379
all of the THC a that's not being

503
00:23:41,548 --> 00:23:46,750
considered THC by the government right

504
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,210
now will be converted into delta-9 and

505
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:52,599
then tested and that's gonna make the

506
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:54,370
point three threshold unattainable for a

507
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:57,219
lot I mean a lot of genetic you know

508
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:58,500
maybe all genetics so it's either gonna

509
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,659
come down to techniques like

510
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,548
streptomyces if that's what works or

511
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:06,970
nitrogen deficiency if that's what works

512
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:08,859
or everybody calling and emailing the

513
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,440
USDA and telling them not to make this

514
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:14,678
decision or what they really should do

515
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,909
is test decarboxylated but raise the

516
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:20,048
threshold from point 3 to 1 percent or

517
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:23,559
0.7 or something that makes sense

518
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:25,298
genetically I think yeah I think one

519
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:28,960
percents a real solid number I think

520
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:33,490
that's an achievable number by anybody I

521
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,528
think so Labs in Oregon that are ISO

522
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,569
certified like the highest level of

523
00:24:35,528 --> 00:24:40,089
certification to get for a lab what do

524
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:41,500
you think they're to continue that

525
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:43,750
certification what do you think that

526
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,940
their air their error ranges like

527
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,710
percentage-wise how much of an error can

528
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:51,970
they have and still be considered an

529
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:55,840
accurate test plus minus ten percent

530
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:59,140
correct yeah right so five percent so

531
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:02,259
ten yeah ten percent window we're

532
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:04,240
talking about 0.3% so you're telling me

533
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:07,240
that the labs out there that have a 10%

534
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,460
window of inaccuracy are going to be

535
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:15,788
able to tell you that oh this is 0.3% on

536
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:20,220
the nose like like it's just it's a

537
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:22,839
ridiculous law to begin with the idea of

538
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,940
segregating a plant out cannabis its

539
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:26,859
cannabis and you're segregating it out

540
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,890
and calling it a hemp with a completely

541
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:31,959
random number that somebody came up with

542
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,788
that said well this that's different in

543
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,700
Europe and different in other countries

544
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:38,279
right and it's

545
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,220
point two is the European Union's and

546
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:42,690
that's well I haven't actually read the

547
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,460
law but what we're being told is that's

548
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,539
total THC they I don't think they

549
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:50,309
discriminate between the THC molecules

550
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:54,990
so they have an even lower threshold but

551
00:25:50,309 --> 00:26:00,210
up until not that long ago it was 1% and

552
00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:03,120
they just changed it yes honestly I

553
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,640
think I think it should be I think it

554
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:08,399
should be done by ratio if a plant let's

555
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:13,560
say is 20 to 120 parts CBD to one part

556
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:15,390
THC and and above hemp right because why

557
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:22,230
are you going to fault somebody for

558
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:23,910
growing a plant better why but it's

559
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:26,970
punishing people who grow plants better

560
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:29,009
well you know if I grow my plant better

561
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:30,750
and I get higher test results that's

562
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:32,309
going to take me outside of the range of

563
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,930
legality but somebody else can grow the

564
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:37,529
same plant fucking crappy and get low

565
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:55,170
test scores and that's fine it's it's um

566
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:59,789
it's a messed up system Adam loves Fox

567
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:03,180
firm soil so for parking plants and

568
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:04,619
getting them green and lush again so

569
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:08,730
there's like cheater things right that

570
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:10,649
you can do and it is the path of least

571
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:12,150
resistance to getting a plant back to

572
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,370
health is just throwing some more shit

573
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,710
ocean forest and give it four weeks and

574
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:20,459
it looks beautiful again which is a

575
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:23,100
testament to Fox farm I'm not bad and I

576
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:26,039
know that it's like there's other ways

577
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:28,109
to do it but I'm very busy and I don't

578
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,430
have time to mix all the soil so if we

579
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:31,259
want to bicker about it as soon as he

580
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,360
gets down to mixing up all the soil and

581
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:37,529
making it right then I won't have to

582
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:41,269
here's Fox Chris and I don't really

583
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:43,599
bigger about much about anything

584
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:43,599
No

585
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:49,549
we are non confrontational not we're no

586
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:52,159
drama people well we've been together

587
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:54,279
for a long time as partners you know and

588
00:27:52,160 --> 00:28:03,640
when we first got together I think we

589
00:27:54,279 --> 00:28:06,529
kind of set set yeah but we're just

590
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,940
always kind of on the same page about it

591
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:10,129
I know it sounds weird and I'm not

592
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:14,480
trying to be like things are perfect in

593
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:17,000
our world but like generally we try to

594
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,759
go too many directions at the same time

595
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,380
so it's hard to like really focus on

596
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:26,599
something but it's rare that Chris and I

597
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,040
even do much working together in the

598
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:30,169
same space because we have so many

599
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,119
projects going on you know so it's like

600
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,920
Adam you handle this and I'm gonna

601
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:35,389
handle this and it's you know his

602
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,700
responsibility to do that part it's my

603
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:39,380
responsibility to this part and as long

604
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,259
as neither of us fucking drops the ball

605
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:45,440
like and we haven't there's really

606
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:47,569
nothing to bitch each other and you know

607
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,930
we're great friends and you know we've

608
00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:53,569
been friends for a long time now and

609
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:55,880
yeah it's it's really our relationship

610
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:59,689
is as good as it sounds like it's just I

611
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:02,600
could not have a better partner or

612
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:05,090
person to work with he grounds me in so

613
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:07,279
many ways and keeps my feet on the

614
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:09,109
ground and keeps me calm when I'm

615
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,039
freaking out I'm a super anxious person

616
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:16,519
and you know totally kind of the yin to

617
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,109
my yang or whatever you know like it's a

618
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:20,599
really it's also a symbiotic

619
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:22,639
relationship right and I'm sure Adam

620
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:26,409
goes and does all the social stuff like

621
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:30,350
talking on video and pressing palms and

622
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:32,210
getting our names out there and but not

623
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:34,549
and then I get to grow but now I have

624
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:36,500
too much like that stuff I've drugged

625
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:40,029
him into it now yeah I make him go to

626
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,029
the speaking engagements and stuff

627
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,429
[Music]

628
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:51,500
like I guess some breeders that you

629
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:56,299
respect for me as far as like THC

630
00:29:51,500 --> 00:30:00,410
breeders Sonny Chiba OD diesel so that's

631
00:29:56,299 --> 00:30:03,319
Sonny Chivas Shane Yocum did like purple

632
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:05,300
Doge black cherry soda things like that

633
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:07,849
OD Diesel's Rayman Bowser homegrown

634
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:11,629
natural wonders so like Mickey Kush

635
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:13,969
Doctor Who things of those varieties

636
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:16,600
those two guys really kind of like

637
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:20,299
brought me into the fold of like

638
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:24,139
contemporaries breeders just amazing

639
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:26,210
dudes too super nice as far as like plug

640
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:29,060
a seed into the soil and grow hot fire

641
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:31,759
Colin Gordon from ethos has been killing

642
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:36,169
it lately like his shit super poly

643
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:38,660
hybrid whatever stuff but I've never

644
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,220
grown an easier plant from seed it's

645
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:43,400
just feminized comes up and it's fuckin

646
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:47,450
chronic like so like as newer kind of

647
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:50,240
breeders go like he's a rad guy and Kyle

648
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:53,690
kushman or Adam Ornstein from high times

649
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,099
Cushman's cough really kinda like before

650
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,400
I knew a bunch of people in the industry

651
00:30:55,099 --> 00:31:00,230
like really reached out and was like

652
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:08,090
he's now a close personal friend of mine

653
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:11,269
and he uses veggie matrix right which is

654
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:16,029
vegan plant food but yes I believe that

655
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:19,129
he grows in a in a neutral medium yeah

656
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:21,379
so the first time I met the guy right we

657
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:23,060
were in San Diego for a can of grow and

658
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,130
we're on the beach and it's the first

659
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:26,839
time I've met the guy and like so he

660
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,400
comes up in his Kyle kushman way and

661
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:30,559
he's like you grow with veggie matrix

662
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,970
and I'm like nah and he's like well why

663
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,919
not and I was like there's no bone meal

664
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,720
in it and he's like well yeah it's vegan

665
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,730
and I'm like yeah I like bone me on so I

666
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,890
kind of like shit talked him right and I

667
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:43,190
think he liked that like you know that

668
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:45,230
like I just wasn't like okay and then

669
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,269
like you know like did things like

670
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,460

00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:53,240
so Cal went and hung with all the High

672

Times guys and just he's a really nice

673
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,870
guy and I think he gets a little bit

674
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:59,599
in the industry but like as a person

675
00:31:56,869 --> 00:32:03,589
he's just an absolutely wonderful person

676
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:05,359
and then the the spannabis crew for like

677
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:08,418
kind of inviting me to span of us to

678
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,099
speak and like just going to span of

679
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:11,809
this was like a bucket list item to me

680
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:17,028
but when I was invited to speak it's

681
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:19,190
Vanegas yeah just like melted me like I

682

much love for - yeah - who's gonna hate

686
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:37,428
me now yeah - or tsk he is one of the

687
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:40,609
seed company og CBD breeders in the

688
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:41,960
country and you should record him

689
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:43,609
sometime and ask him about the

690
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,649
Charlotte's Web story and stuff because

691
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:47,959
there's a lot of a lot of information

692
00:32:45,648 --> 00:32:51,408
there to dissect and look through and

693
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,750
but he is he's an amazing individual who

694
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:55,730
really helped us with our path with CBD

695
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,038
and our kind of collaborations together

696
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:03,528
back at the beginning was CBD really

697
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:06,980
pushed the envelope my colleague Mike

698
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:11,119
calling Araya love Andrew Campbell so

699
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,649
those the guys at geek farms farms were

700
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,449
really impressed with their they're not

701
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:15,739
written necessarily breeders but they're

702
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:19,429
reading their own strains and they're

703
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:21,620
coming out with some great hot fire and

704
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:23,659
they've got they're finding really good

705
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:26,479
genetics to make crosses with that's

706
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:31,600
stuff that hasn't really been around

707
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:34,878
that much lately I guess I'm saying I've

708
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:37,459
that Crooked River Blues and the organ

709
00:33:34,878 --> 00:33:39,259
eating to go lots of stuff from the

710
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:42,649
blueberry space it's kind of what they

711
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:44,870
started with and then they kind of went

712
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:47,709
into work with like they really like

713
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:50,778
like the lemon D the sour lemon D

714
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:53,659
electric lemon G those kind of strains

715
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:57,980
and what they really do good is the

716
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:59,389
grape hide you know it's the elf oh I'm

717
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,889
sorry that's been the alpha cut of the

718
00:33:59,388 --> 00:34:02,490
Doctor Who better than anybody in the

719
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:04,889
world

720
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:07,109
and there we is clean their wheat is

721
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:10,050
organic it smokes down to a white ash

722
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:12,109
it's nice and Kayla crowd at the top

723
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:14,970
with like the crack it's perfectly

724
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:16,230
perfect and I'm a super snob and I've

725
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:19,819
smoked weed from everywhere it's the

726
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,820
best fucking weed in the world man

727
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:34,519
what's publicly popular that frustrates

728
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:38,460
you like as a strainer product or I mean

729
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:41,000
27% hydro garbage I'm the dude that

730
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:44,610
walks into the store see we've owned

731
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,219
clubs and dispensaries and recreational

732
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,929
stores and we've done everything the

733
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:51,299
dude that walks into the store and goes

734
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:54,030

735
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,769
guy that guy irritates me because it's

736
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,720
like why well that's what's gonna give

737

me most high well let me educate you I

738
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:01,949
don't want it what's your highest

739
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,590
testing yo G well I got thirty percent

740
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:06,659
whatever Oh G I'll take that okay have a

741
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:09,420
nice day you know like that's a closed

742
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:12,739
mindedness ya not willing to listen to

743
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:15,539
scientific data and to be educated and

744
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:17,879
understand that tht percentage really

745
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:21,869
means nothing in the grand scheme of how

746
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:24,000
a plan is going to affect you yeah it's

747
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:38,490
like a status symbol thing right you

748
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:43,289
know mostly eleven names go up to ten

749
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:45,209
exactly as far as genetics nothing I

750
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:47,009
think all genetics have a place you know

751
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,599
some plants get hate you know like

752
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:53,369
everybody's like fuck blue dream forever

753
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:55,380
or whatnot but it's like I just feel

754
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:57,780
like every genetic has there's certain

755
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,730
genetics I don't choose for me that I

756
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,560
don't like but I think every genetics

757
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,119
important and I think it all tells a

758
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,809
story and I think it all has its own

759
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,710
value yeah so there's not much hey you

760
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:10,409
know what I don't like I don't like

761
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:12,449
distillate pin tops it's hot dog water

762
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:12,960
and I don't like it do live resin pen

763
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:18,149
tops there

764
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:20,789
good that our trash there's a lot of

765
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:23,130
trash babe cartridges out there a lot of

766
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:24,509
people just they're cheap so they buy

767
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:28,410
them and they just don't know what

768
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:30,720
they're missing out life resin I think

769
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:33,568
is the best you know so alive or as an

770
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:35,789
extraction opera fresh frozen extraction

771
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:39,420
I just think it just brings Terp down

772
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:41,219
you know you don't distillate with

773
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,349
terpenes reacted you know it's like

774
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:45,779
putting up Evita and your weed bag it's

775
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:48,480
the turf taker right it's just taken

776
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:51,420
away the flavor and wonderfulness of the

777
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,269
weed I don't like anything that that

778
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:57,539
takes it much far away from its original

779
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:59,190
intended botanical value right and so

780
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:01,279
the more you mess with stuff and futz

781
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:04,050
with it and clarify it and do everything

782
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,250
there's so many volatile compounds in

783
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,800
the canvas plant that you're just

784
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:11,159
destroying but it's all for the old

785
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:15,059
mighty THC or the almighty CBD right but

786
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:15,509
it's like that's in everything like who

787
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:18,359
cares

788
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:20,089
like why want to see the you know I want

789
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:23,880
to see your Terps up a twenty percent

790
00:37:20,088 --> 00:37:26,328
say it's like it definitely makes better

791
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,329
medicine
