00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:38,000
there are going to be representatives

bureau is going to be there as well so

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,000
it's going to be one of the first uh and

19
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,320
more recent times that we're going to

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,159
get to hear from Statewide stakeholders

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,600
uh about what's happening in the

22
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,799
industry

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,039
but you know tonight as folks are

24
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,799
talking about what it means to to give

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,719
back and to do the right right thing I I

26
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,759
kind of just want to share a a a quick

27
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,400
story and and just read something to you

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,560
real quick because uh when when folks

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,880
are having these conversations it it

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,320
gets really upsetting to me because we

31
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,920
we often don't talk about the things

32
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,279
that actually matter uh in these spaces

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,118
a lot of the times we're we're just

34
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,879
focused on on money and so I really

35
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:24,560
appreciate Jackie you pulling this

36
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:26,798
conversation together uh because it's

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,159
it's so

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,159
important me one second

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,880
what what I wanted to read to you all

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,479
was uh just just some text that had come

41
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,158
out of a recent news article that had

42
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:44,519
came out um it's it's been circling and

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,520
been on my mind for for a while now uh

44
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:50,519
but last year around this time there was

45
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,959
a young uh African-American male who was

46
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,718
driving uh in his car with his

47
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:59,239
girlfriend and uh a a young 5-year-old

48
00:01:55,718 --> 00:02:01,280
in the back seat uh and he was shot by a

49
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:04,438
police officer officer um and we

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,359
recently just got like dash cam footage

51
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,639
uh to figure out what was going on in in

52
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,038
that particular situation and uh the

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,439
police officer basically said that he

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,559
feared for his life because uh this

55
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,840
young African-American man had there was

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
evidence that he had been smoking uh in

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,039
front of the passenger in front of this

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,360
5-year-old child and that smoke itself

59
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,799
made the officer fear for his life so

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,040
much that he shot this young man seven

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,160
times and it was it was just kind of

62
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,199
outrageous that the marijuana smoke is

63
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,479
is what caused him to fear for his life

64
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,598
and yet this police officer shot seven

65
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,479
times into a vehicle with a 5-year-old

66
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:45,280
child right there and I didn't hear

67
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,158
anything from the marijuana industry

68
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
about

69
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:51,639
it and it's upsetting because if if you

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,959
all are the folks who are going to be

71
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:57,518
carrying this plant as your brand uh you

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,680
need to be able to to stand up for other

73
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:05,879
community members there's a uh a old

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,040
poem uh that was written about uh I

75
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:10,399
guess it was written about Nazis at the

76
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,519
time but they said first they came for

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,599
the Socialists and I didn't speak out

78
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,879
because I was not a socialist then they

79
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:18,959
came for the trade unionist and I did

80
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,679
not speak out because I was not a trade

81
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,560
unionist then they came for the Jews and

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,000
I did not speak out because I was not a

83
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:31,759
Jew then they came for me and there was

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,759
no one left to speak for me so

85
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,319
when we're talking about Jeff sessions

86
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:41,318
and how he likes to use drug war

87
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:45,039
rhetoric to escalate uh situations we

88
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:48,280
know that that language is is is racial

89
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:51,079
uh it's it's used to bolster up uh

90
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,919
racial tensions uh and it's directed and

91
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,760
it's very much targeted towards

92
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,839
low-income communities and communities

93
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,598
of color but you just wait if you sit

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,598
there and you stay silent they're going

95
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,919
to come in for your door and you might

96
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,679
get seven shots or maybe it's your child

97
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,039
who gets seven shots uh so so just keep

98
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,480
that in mind as we're moving this

99
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,878
conversation forward the drug war is

100
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:16,560
alive and well uh and it's not going to

101
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:18,238
go away unless we stand together and

102
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,280
every time there's an issue regardless

103
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:24,198
of if it's a black person a white person

104
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:26,319
a child a patient uh we have to stand

105
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,919
together and I'm I'm here to stand with

106
