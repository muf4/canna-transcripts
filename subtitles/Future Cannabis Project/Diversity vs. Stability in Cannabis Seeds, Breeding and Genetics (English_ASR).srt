[Music]

2
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:19,049
let's talk about that purple panty

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:24,929
dropper what is it why is it in

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:30,390
everything well you know that so the

5
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:32,340
story behind that stream which sometimes

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,020
it's not great for me to mention it

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,239
because it's not super politically

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,530
correct but the purple panty dropper was

9
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:42,179
something that you know it came from

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,549
some sort of hill seeds I kind of call

11
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:47,820
it some some friends some old time

12
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:50,429
growers and humble and actually Southern

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,488
Oregon - yeah and I crossed it with

14
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,600
purple haze and

15
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:58,530
Matanuska mist and eventually it just

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,390
kind of worked its way into our breeding

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,948
program and you know a good breeder

18
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,808
should have kind of like a stud that

19
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:06,060
they really do yeah and that's what it

20
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:08,938
is for you it's your mail well it's not

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,469
anymore okay it was for you know back in

22
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:16,048
the early 2000s and you know up to 2010

23
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:20,188
we used a lot of it but the reason that

24
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:24,240
we named it that isn't because we you

25
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:26,158
know are like - anyway it's it's not a

26
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,699
PC name but the purple panty-dropper got

27
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,810
named

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,340
when there was a party at the farm and I

29
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,170
woke up in the morning I didn't even

30
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,329
partake in the party and I woke up in

31
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,460
the morning and walked up to the garden

32
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:41,639
and and sure enough there's this pair of

33
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:45,239
purple panties like right there at the

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,599
top of the trail in this little circle

35
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:53,009
of open clearing and of course there's

36
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:55,500
you know plenty of purple budding plants

37
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,819
all around it right I went down to the

38
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,310
party which was still happening and said

39
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:05,519
you know I got a good good name for a

40
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,439
strain now but formerly it was known as

41
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,469
purple passion so I guess it's always

42
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,430
kind of inspired passionate behavior

43
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:18,310
whether it was panty-dropping or

44
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:19,959
just being happy and and so you you've

45
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,400
crossed that into a lot of varieties

46
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:27,218
over the years and you know the

47
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,489
interesting thing about like when you're

48
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:34,060
really full disclosure about how you

49
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:37,030
breed a strain I mean if you whether

50
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,819
something is still relevant is is

51
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,699
another question like will tell

52
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:47,078
everybody what we've used to make the

53
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:50,018
variety but it may not be necessarily

54
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:52,060
very relevant anymore so if it was

55
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:55,060
originally made with purple

56
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,449
panty-dropper or you know blueberry

57
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,150
muffin but then it's had you know lots

58
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:03,518
of back crossing happen like any true

59
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,769
good breeders should be doing to provide

60
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:11,280
like a consistent uniform

61
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:14,049
seed line then it won't really you know

62
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,989
display a lot of characteristics of some

63
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:20,139
of those early crosses that you used to

64
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:23,530
create it sure while you know it's still

65
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:25,930
you know full disclosure to mention it

66
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,090
and and it's standard practice to and in

67
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,599
cannabis industry you see a lot of folks

68
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:36,039
who are like this is you know blah blah

69
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:39,759
blah times Green crack times you know og

70
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:41,789
or whatever and that's doesn't

71
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,739
necessarily mean that you're just gonna

72
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:47,198
pick up a bud and smoke it and be like I

73
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,819
taste Green crack and then you know a

74
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,790
hint of OG it might be something

75
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:54,068
completely new if you've spent some time

76
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:55,568
working with it so absolutely I mean

77
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:57,818
we're talking about hybrids of hybrids

78
00:03:55,568 --> 00:04:00,758
hybrids you see these recessive genetics

79
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:02,408
come out like what was that almost some

80
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:04,869
obscure trait in one of the great

81
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:08,340
grandparents or whatever right and

82
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:12,639
that's why you know we like to reference

83
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,949
the genetic variation that's you know

84
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,459
sort of the hetero homozygosity that you

85
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:21,310
can find out through genetic analysis

86
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,050
using like FiOS bioscience or a number

87
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,569
of the different

88
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,780
genetic research services that are

89
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:31,960
available now to cannabis you can

90
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:34,929
actually like go ahead and submit a seed

91
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:38,918
line and they'll tell you exactly how

92
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:43,509
diverse or uniform the offspring will be

93
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:45,639
so and a lot of our stuff you know we're

94
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:50,439
pretty proud that it's really really far

95
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:52,269
into the uniform on the uniform end of

96
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,918
thing the spectrum rather than the

97
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:59,139
diverse and that said you know like gosh

98
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,810
six seven eight nine ten twenty years

99
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:04,210
ago we had a lot of diversity in our

100
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:08,829
varietals and since we've been around

101
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:10,779
and humble for a long long time you know

102
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:13,899
sometimes I get some shit about that

103
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:16,179
people would be like you know you you

104
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:17,769
use the same you know purple panty

105
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,150
dropper or whatever and I'm just like

106
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:24,549
hey you know try us give us a try again

107
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:28,209
five years ten years after you you know

108
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:31,180
had diversity in your in your garden and

109
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:33,218
any seed these you know there's really

110
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,199
at this point in time there's really not

111
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:39,430
any such thing as like a true breeding

112
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:43,150
cannabis seed when you compare it to

113
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:48,699
like a major agricultural crop like corn

114
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:53,019
that's been focused on for you know a

115
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:56,650
hundred plus years by breeders like with

116
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:58,240
a scientific method and and breeding

117
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:02,348
strategy the traditional breeding

118
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,840
practices and and now you know genetic

119
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:10,240
markers marker assisted breeding and and

120
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:13,689
you can really have like a row of corn

121
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,110
or an acre or ten acres a corn that are

122
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:20,348
almost completely identical plants you

123
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:23,680
know even genetically they're you know

124
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:25,689
not much drift in the population whereas

125
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,120
with cannabis we just haven't really

126
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:29,978
gotten there yet and that's something

127
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,959
that we've been really working on over

128
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:36,370
the last five or six years internally is

129
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,789
making in

130
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:42,550
red lines and then doing you know real

131
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:47,470
f1 hybrids rather than you know what

132
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:50,918
everybody refers to as as an f1 or an f2

133
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:53,350
or f3 they're not actually you know in

134
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:56,680
conventional agriculture that wouldn't

135
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:59,500
be even something that anybody would

136
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,389
even share with the public you know it's

137
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,339
still the realm of fallen chucking at

138
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:06,220
that point further absolutely yes and

139
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:08,829
don't get me wrong like we are on camera

140
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:12,460
and on a microphone up and some I don't

141
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:14,740
have anything against breeders that do

142
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:17,349
that that's how I started out I mean you

143
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,418
know if you're misrepresenting it in

144
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,000
some way then maybe that's not such a

145
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:23,769
good thing and it does can give seed

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,199
growing you know kind of a bad name a

147
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:29,019
little bit I've gotten some of the most

148
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:31,419
phenomenal product ever out of

149
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:34,240
completely random crosses you know

150
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:36,549
friends a friend have done right I mean

151
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,340
kind of bash against it it just touches

152
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,348
on a word that you use that came up

153
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:44,049
earlier when I was talking with Beth yes

154
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:47,709
stability right and what stability means

155
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,740
and stability has until recently at

156
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:52,930
least in my world referred to the

157
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,470
ability for one seed to be similar to

158
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,189
another and you have a line and

159
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,340
especially when we're growing these big

160
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:01,779
plants that oh yeah part of this one can

161
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:03,819
be matched up with this other in the

162
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:06,579
finished product exactly well that's

163
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:09,240
that's a big thing that we that's the

164
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:12,399
goal is like we started saying you know

165
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,620
we guarantee you can walk down the row

166
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,899
and of course this is subjective because

167
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,800
it's up to everybody's opinion sure but

168
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:22,089
cut and throw it into the same bin and

169
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,079
you know that said one of the hardest

170
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:31,779
things that I've noticed to nail down is

171
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:35,168
the level of anthocyanin yep in each

172
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:38,049
plant and that is kind of been sort of

173
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:40,208
at least one of our golden Grails is

174
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:43,478
trying to breed a strain that is like

175
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:46,269
purple every single time yeah that's

176
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,759
like the same degree of purple every

177
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:50,439
single time right and like our blueberry

178
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:53,769
muffin strain

179
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,970
that one just you know it continues to

180
00:08:53,769 --> 00:09:00,220
elude us like getting the purple super

181
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:04,570
consistent the smell on the other hand

182
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:07,240
like every single time is a blueberry

183
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,120
muffin smell I mean absolutely that's

184
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,789
that's what I've seen in growing it it's

185
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,129
just it's a it's a color difference when

186
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:16,899
it comes down to the end yeah and how

187
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:19,509
the color comes in whether it comes in

188
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:23,199
very much at the end right or whether it

189
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:24,669
almost starts all yeah and that's gonna

190
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,070
be the case whenever you have purple

191
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:29,219
cannabis you're gonna have potentially

192
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:33,220
like the top of the plant or the

193
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:36,790
Southside might get purple quicker and

194
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:40,420
the north side not at all yeah you're

195
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:45,459
gonna have a variable degree of the

196
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:46,750
purple pigment no matter what so it's

197
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,900
just something to keep we're gonna keep

198
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:53,529
working on it and but it is it's like

199
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:55,899
that's the crux of seeds and clones and

200
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:59,589
breeding and that whole thing is I think

201
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:01,569
but then what you said like distinct

202
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,129
what we call distinct population crosses

203
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,070
so purposefully being like well I'm

204
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:10,389
gonna take something that is way over

205
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:13,510
here from you know Columbia Jamaican

206
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:16,809
land race and cross it with something

207
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:22,200
that's much more common and and you know

208
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:26,219
sort of westernized or American

209
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:30,009
that's gonna produce a vast array of

210
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:32,379
diversity in the progeny and then the

211
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:35,799
likelihood of finding something amazing

212
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:38,980
is actually increased when you have that

213
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:41,799
kind of a you know spread of diversity

214
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,210
and but that on the other hand the

215
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:46,059
likelihood of having something that's

216
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:50,340
kind of I want want want is also

217
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:53,259
increased so the more diversity the

218
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,899
higher your chances are of finding

219
00:10:53,259 --> 00:11:00,189
something really cool and the higher the

220
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:02,799
chances are of having you know a few

221
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,260
entire plants that you grow

222
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:08,500
just like oh man this is gonna be like

223
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:12,220
the hardest stuff to sell and so it's

224
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,350
not like what any commercial grower who

225
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,500
wants to be doing and that's why we did

226
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:20,409
that giant phenotype huh our phenotype

227
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:23,769
mega hunt project this last summer where

228
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:27,039
we like looked through 10,000 cannabis

229
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:29,589
plants you know ten different licensed

230
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:33,278
facilities throughout the state and

231
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:36,820
tracked it and we have our own gas

232
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:41,078
liquid chromatograph so we can test it

233
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:44,079
and you know we got our data spreadsheet

234
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:49,179
that we enter all the info and it was a

235
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:51,338
lot of goddamn work like man I still

236
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:54,250
like that's why I'm late kind of getting

237
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:58,870
here like we're doing that right now I

238
00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:02,100
got my family is watching after all the

239
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,970
babies and and helping keep them happy

240
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,940
but we've narrowed them down

241
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,700
significantly so it went from ten

242
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,110
thousand three months ago you know over

243
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,890
the course of the summer ten thousand

244
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,480
cuttings off ten thousand unique plants

245
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:19,569
quickly you know narrowed it down after

246
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,089
depth you know we we essentially want to

247
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:27,190
get it down to the best 1% and then from

248
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:30,310
there you know really now we're like the

249
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:33,670
best point five percent which you know

250
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:36,338
so we really want to end up with 50

251
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:39,099
keepers yeah absolutely

252
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:41,980
and I mean I think as far as the

253
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,709
stability of the seed stock goes there's

254
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,959
there's kind of two different schools of

255
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:49,119
thought as what are you doing with the

256
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,009
seeds are you growing them in the nature

257
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,659
that like you're talking when you talk

258
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:55,208
about stability in these rows you're

259
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:57,730
talking about seed plans outdoor big

260
00:12:55,208 --> 00:13:00,939
picture planning the plant to be the

261
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:02,949
plant that it is versus other people who

262
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,630
are saying no I'm taking this seed stock

263
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,939
and I'm doing a fee know hunt with it

264
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:09,220
and I'm finding the keeper yeah maybe

265
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,949
the two keepers but typically just the

266
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:15,939
best of the best in their eyes and in

267
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:19,448
that how great instability really versa

268
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:23,019
is having a potential to have the one

269
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:26,198
that's that's so fabulous we have two

270
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:29,709
programs essentially in the way we breed

271
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:31,688
one is looking for diversity and that's

272
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:33,548
the quickest and easiest program you

273
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:35,288
just take something that's really

274
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:37,448
different random and you want to mash it

275
00:13:35,288 --> 00:13:40,720
up and you mash it up and you produce

276
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:43,748
seeds and then you plant them and hunt

277
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,298
through them so that's the really simple

278
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:48,399
one we never like sell those seeds for

279
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:50,588
example there sure you know we give them

280
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,259
and share them openly with people that

281
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:57,119
want to participate in that process and

282
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:59,349
then the the hard work is stabilizing

283
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:02,139
something that you've already sort of

284
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:06,220
identified as being unique and special

285
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:09,158
then creating a long you know true

286
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,408
breeding line which we're still little

287
00:14:09,158 --> 00:14:13,778
ways from getting to true breeding but I

288
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:16,178
think you know we're there with some of

289
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:18,849
our lines to where you can walk down the

290
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:21,788
row and you know harvest into the same

291
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:24,309
tote from plant to plant and that's the

292
00:14:21,788 --> 00:14:26,318
idea so another thing we were talking

293
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:29,198
about earlier but just it's a perfect

294
00:14:26,318 --> 00:14:32,139
kind of segue into this first ability is

295
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,478
the use of the word stability is that

296
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:37,329
we've always used and when I say we I

297
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:39,339
just mean my my smaller community within

298
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:41,528
within this bigger community yeah is

299
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:43,269
that we use it in reference to what

300
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:45,188
you're talking about which is that this

301
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:52,209
one looks like the other and in recent

302
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:54,278
times with the kind of with all of the

303
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:56,288
feminized stock going on with all of

304
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,470
that that we've started to see the word

305
00:14:56,288 --> 00:15:01,989
stability refer to its propensity to

306
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,389
hermaphrodite right yeah yeah I noticed

307
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:07,209
that as well I always assumed that it

308
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:10,778
would just refer to like the uniform

309
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:13,508
nature of the rise so that's how we've

310
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:16,658
always kind of referenced it but I do

311
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:18,519
I'll get people being like oh yeah so it

312
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:22,208
doesn't ever hermaphrodite and I'm like

313
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:25,600
shit if it if anything has a propensity

314
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:28,609
to hermaphrodite we get it out the door

315
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,230
as quickly as possible so it

316
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,209
you're not in school that that's that's

317
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,579
the good stock that's the pollen source

318
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:36,679
for the know I saw that post did you see

319
00:15:34,578 --> 00:15:39,319
that recent post I won't mention who it

320
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:42,620
was but one of the you know one of the

321
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:45,350
cannabis is pioneers it a really great

322
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:48,980
person this a little bit maybe missing

323
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:53,060
misinformed about that was said you know

324
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:55,190
oh if you have a plant that starts to

325
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:57,559
hermaphrodite onto you don't throw it

326
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,450
away because you can make feminized

327
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:04,278
seeds with it and I was just like oh

328
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,720
because and that was like a post it went

329
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:09,370
all over the place people were like oh

330
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:13,040
so you know I can keep my hermaphrodite

331
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:16,509
plants and use any pollen that they

332
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:20,360
produce to just makes seeds and

333
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:25,100
basically cannabis is a dioecious plant

334
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:28,459
which means that it has male and female

335
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,129
parts on separate plants they're not on

336
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:34,338
the same plant right like an example of

337
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:37,549
a manisha plant would be corn so you've

338
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:41,870
got the tassels that produce a pollen

339
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:44,899
that falls down onto the silk which is a

340
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:48,889
pistol of a flower which then produces

341
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:52,940
seeds so that's a Manas cannabis is a

342
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:57,259
dioecious but many dioecious plants like

343
00:16:52,940 --> 00:17:00,800
cannabis have the capability as an

344
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:06,230
evolutionary you know like last-ditch

345
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:09,558
effort to produce the opposite sex organ

346
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:12,230
if it has noticed it's like you know if

347
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:14,418
there are stresses or you know all

348
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,970
different kind of things and some of

349
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:19,730
them have a propensity to do that which

350
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:23,660
are hermaphroditic varieties and some of

351
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:28,009
them just can get stressed out enough or

352
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:32,259
of course there's making sex reversal of

353
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:35,509
a plant which essentially involves

354
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:38,359
introducing an ethylene inhibitor that

355
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:40,028
actually keeps the plants natural

356
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:44,168
hormone

357
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:47,250
allowing it to produce female parts for

358
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:53,429
example and therefore it produces

359
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:57,730
default which is male so every plant has

360
00:17:53,429 --> 00:18:01,570
the the DNA that that it takes to be a

361
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:04,778
male or a female but they there's a

362
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:12,178
switch that essentially you know is

363
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:15,700
assigned at conception that you know

364
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:20,559
would make the plant turn one sex or the

365
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:24,580
other and if the if this even if the

366
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:28,450
switch is on and like an at an ethylene

367
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:30,730
inhibitor is introduced then it'll just

368
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,548
go to default which would be male and so

369
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:36,159
that's where you get the creation the

370
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:40,778
proper creating creation of feminized

371
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:43,000
seeds cryo and and there's people that

372
00:18:40,778 --> 00:18:45,038
want to do that with like one specific

373
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,440
strain that has a propensity to

374
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,359
hermaphrodite you know I would say that

375
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,009
that's something that should be frowned

376
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:54,189
upon and there's a lot of folks that are

377
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:55,450
doing it you know properly but I think

378
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,929
the biggest thing is that we should

379
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:03,759
avoid there is the possibility that if

380
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:06,639
enough like you know misguided breeding

381
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:10,509
happens that cannabis could start to

382
00:19:06,638 --> 00:19:13,439
evolve into more of a Manas which would

383
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:16,599
be real shitty because we'd never have a

384
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,919
sense of me anymore so I think it is

385
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:21,428
important that people understand this

386
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:25,299
and don't like you know go you know

387
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:27,850
breeding with just any hermie pollen you

388
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:30,690
know that's absolutely and so you know

389
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:34,079
and give I'll give the guy a break

390
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:37,960
who did that big post I mean he's got I

391
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:39,428
don't even know a million followers or

392
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,679
something like that but I was just like

393
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:44,409
no and a bunch of other folks oft on

394
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,870
there and they were like no no like we

395
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:49,210
don't want people to think that it's a

396
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:50,479
great idea to just take a hermaphrodite

397
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,360
plant

398
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,089
and and breed with that because the

399
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:59,139
seeds will be mostly female or all

400
00:19:56,089 --> 00:20:05,178
female that's the worst

401
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:10,100
exactly yeah well and as far as their

402
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:12,650
hermaphrodites go I don't know how much

403
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:17,659
you've worked with plants that show

404
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:20,030
hermaphroditic tendencies but what what

405
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,700
we see is kind of two distinct paths

406
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:24,230
that go down one is when it shows it

407
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,769
early on in the beginning of flowering

408
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:30,860
coming off an apical calyx versus later

409
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:33,168
on showing it through the flower and

410
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:35,808
expression of that that same you know

411
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:39,919
like you're saying like the banana that

412
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:42,529
comes out at the end you know so I

413
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,210
totally agree this is a very interesting

414
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:45,649
subject to me and I've been talking with

415
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,890
a lot of people about it in just in the

416
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:52,429
last couple months so I do believe that

417
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:55,160
there are two types of hermaphrodites in

418
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:57,169
cannabis one is a little bit more

419
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,860
genetically inherent and the other one

420
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:04,630
may just be related to environmental

421
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:08,839
stressors so like what you refer to

422
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:11,419
where you've got you know full-on male

423
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:15,069
and female parts coming out early on in

424
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:18,500
the stage in flowering stage well that's

425
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:23,779
obviously I would say you know more of a

426
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:27,019
genetic inherent hermaphrodite and then

427
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:28,308
when you have plants that will produce a

428
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,500
little banana

429
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:34,160
I call it essentially it's an anther

430
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:37,279
yeah that comes out of the plant at the

431
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:41,650
end of flowering that's more because you

432
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:48,798
know this female cannabis plan is like

433
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:52,820
you know sure there's no good I'm gonna

434
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:54,410
make my own that's you know some of the

435
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:56,750
questions we kind of have as we go

436
00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:00,740
through these various these various

437
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:03,839
stocks that we that we work with where

438
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:06,150
we have some varieties that it doesn't

439
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,980
the extreme temperature and humidity

440
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,630
differences we have and the differences

441
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,269
in nutrients and even more extreme

442
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:14,070
stresses like in light depth of having

443
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:17,009
some of the issues that we see we have

444
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:19,829
these these cultivars that they don't

445
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:22,500
really express this and then in working

446
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:24,599
and I hate to say but I've seen it go

447
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,750
way up as I've started to work more with

448
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,129
feminized stock and I I'm not gonna sit

449
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,230
here and make any statement that I could

450
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:35,010
see that that's a hundred percent what's

451
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:37,740
causing it but interestingly enough I

452
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:39,900
did a phenyl hunt last year in two

453
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,809
separate spaces one in door one in the

454
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,240
greenhouse and I saw more stress

455
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:48,059
initially in the greenhouse more

456
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:51,269
variables and a higher percentage of

457
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,639
them show hermaphroditic tendencies we

458
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:55,170
got rid of all of that we went back to

459
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,020
our mom stock that we taking cuttings

460
00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:03,210
off of and brought forward ones that

461
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:06,269
didn't show anything as we go forward

462
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:08,670
now we're not seeing any apical calyx as

463
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:10,769
throwing hermaphroditic flowers because

464
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:14,509
we got rid of those but we're seeing

465
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:17,129
some of the other varieties now that

466
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:20,420
express at the very end of flowering

467
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:24,690
they're throw they're throwing this out

468
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:28,529
yeah and I mean to me like the ones that

469
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:31,350
throw out the bananas at the end it's a

470
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:33,720
little less concerning overall for like

471
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:36,659
the whole species like sure you know

472
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,299
like obviously it's not something that's

473
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,519
desirable at all but you know I don't

474
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:44,149
think the trimmers don't like it yeah

475
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,150
yeah

476
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:52,849
but here's an interesting thing that I

477
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:56,209
noticed this year is we did a ton of

478
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:59,429
landrace breeding and crossing just

479
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:02,269
growing pure landraces or whatever we

480
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:06,090
ended up going to Jamaica last year

481
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:08,789
Ethiopia and then of course we had that

482
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:11,679
Willie G's seed that Willie had brought

483
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:16,450
back from Lebanon and

484
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:18,779
and a few more too but anyway these ones

485
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,069
that add when people sail and raise

486
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:25,889
different kind of definitions of that

487
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:25,889
but I'm talking like landrace like

488
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:33,460
redline that well so in bread and and

489
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:36,719
selected by nature not even as much by

490
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:41,799
breeding so like wild populations or or

491
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:45,339
populations see you above populations

492
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:49,629
that essentially just the the selection

493
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:53,859
is is natural so you know it's it's an

494
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:56,050
isolated population the selection is

495
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:58,149
less based on somebody doing fee know

496
00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:01,480
one thing for example and more just like

497
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:03,850
what grows best in Jamaica you know what

498
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,819
what works in a giant field and Lebanon

499
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:10,209
that we can get the most hash with the

500
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:12,460
littlest least effort you know so yeah

501
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:15,750
like and that's kind of like I mean

502
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:19,660
eventually who knows you know cannabis

503
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:22,240
hopefully just is treated like you know

504
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,440
any other crop tomato or whatever and we

505
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,029
can grow as much of it as we want

506
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:30,190
someday and then you know maybe as a

507
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:32,589
breeder I'll be like yeah what is

508
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:36,970
something that we can throw in a giant

509
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:40,720
field and forget about it and come back

510
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:42,579
you know six months later and whether

511
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,769
they're seeds or not we don't care we're

512
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:49,210
gonna make a oh man bio and hash and you

513
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:53,980
know we're gonna get all the different

514
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:55,900
uses from it so land race can mean

515
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,579
different things but these these I would

516
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,790
say are the most purest form they're

517
00:25:57,579 --> 00:26:03,939
both isolated and they're selected by

518
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:06,460
nature and so bringing those back that

519
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:09,779
actually we I noticed like those have a

520
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:13,059
higher propensity to throw those little

521
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:17,139
nanners at the end of the season now

522
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:19,720
none of them were full-on you know

523
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,640
displaying both sexes like you're

524
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,130
talking about where you have more of

525
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:28,640
like this manisha Stipe

526
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:31,820
but they were definitely like commonly

527
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:42,920
showing bananas what do you look for in

528
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:45,139
a seed company passion love love love

529
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,090
for the plan it's what I look for in in

530
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:49,640
anyone that I work with in this

531
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:52,039
community like we all got families to

532
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,740
feed we all want to have a decently

533
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:56,509
comfortable life I was like I'm not

534
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:01,960
gonna play some game of being 100%

535
00:26:56,509 --> 00:27:04,430
altruistic all the time but that money

536
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:08,090
doesn't and in my opinion shouldn't come

537
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:10,220
first all the damn time and how kind of

538
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:12,139
short-sighted it is when people are

539
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:19,549
constantly putting that that dollar

540
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:21,080
first and I just I like to see that the

541
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:25,609
people would genuinely enjoy the plan

542
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:29,000
that's great I love hearing that and I

543
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:32,990
wholeheartedly agree you know I always

544
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,519
tell folks like well you know we get a

545
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:39,319
ton of people that are like we'd love to

546
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:41,930
work with you or whatever and I i don't

547
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:43,849
ever say like oh they don't have enough

548
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:46,580
Instagram followers for me to bother

549
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:49,240
working with them or some dumb bullshit

550
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:53,990
like that I try to meet people and

551
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:57,200
decide like how you know smart and

552
00:27:53,990 --> 00:28:00,019
passionate is this person and that's the

553
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,880
only thing I care about you know like if

554
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:04,309
you're smart and passionate about

555
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,100
cannabis and and wanting to you know

556
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:09,500
work in this space and and improve

557
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:13,969
things and and share in medicine and and

558
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:17,960
the fucking love for the plant and I you

559
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:19,279
know you have a half a brain you know if

560
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,740
you're an intelligent person you're

561
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,430
clearly an intelligent person so let's

562
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,450
work together

563
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:29,620
I think that's I've seen people that you

564
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:34,509
know started with nothing and

565
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:36,158
and one year later they're like one of

566
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:40,569
our biggest collaborative partners

567
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:43,570
because they just you know are smart and

568
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:45,519
they know what's a good know a good idea

569
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:47,668
when they see one or have one or

570
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,668
whatever

571
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:56,809
