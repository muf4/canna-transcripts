[Music]

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:18,620
foreign

3
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:18,619
[Music]

4
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:36,120
it's at 2 000 feet versus uh well I

5
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,700
don't know how much it has to do with

6
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:42,718
like microclimates and terroir and all

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,040
that as it does that there's no real uh

8
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,219
legitimate

9
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,378
system to honor the naming of of

10
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:52,340
cultivars so there's quite a bit of an

11
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:55,079
uncertainty until the end of the product

12
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,079
and also that comes across within the

13
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,539
table where this our our flowers are

14
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,859
being sold sometimes the farmer will

15
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,660
call it one thing and by the time

16
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,280
money's exchanging hands it's called

17
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:07,319
something completely different well all

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,599
right but then let's start with let's

19
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,959
start with like two farmers you know who

20
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,819
are growing the same scum Tech clone in

21
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,519
different climates like have you noticed

22
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:20,039
you know it's the same it would

23
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,798
definitely definitely be differences

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,820
where it comes to sun exposure it comes

25
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,618
to like

26
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,000
the nutritional profile of that

27
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,739
different Farm yeah you're going to see

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,540
some differences but depending on the

29
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:32,579
the stability of the genetics that

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,439
you're working with you should always be

31
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,319
able to tell that it's somewhat within

32
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:39,419
the same scope do you have a farm not

33
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,118
Curry like a home ground I have always

34
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,939
had a homework so on your home or on

35
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,759
your property you know like what stuff

36
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:51,719
that you know doesn't grow well there

37
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,459
uh let's see so I've been humble on

38
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,879
anything that's

39
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,978
gonna be overly leafy the ogs do really

40
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,339
well things that don't create large

41
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:04,379
colas we like in my area because we're

42
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,240
just so Coastal

43
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:09,719
um all right so you're dealing with like

44
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:13,139
Coastal and elevation no I'm sea level

45
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:15,419
Coastal so Coastal okay yeah I mean at

46
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:18,000
best I'm a thousand feet

47
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:22,219
and then what about down in like the San

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,219
Diego up there we're 3200

49
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:28,039
I didn't ask you what does grow well but

50
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,020
what grows well and doesn't grow well

51
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:33,739
because that's drier right or is it

52
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,540
Coastal yeah you know our where we are

53
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:38,700
for our farm we grow in greenhouses

54
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:41,959
because you know we get some pretty good

55
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:44,359
wind we put some outdoors out there yeah

56
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,500
it doesn't matter what

57
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,780
genetics that they were they all

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,719
understood was windy so they all just

59
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,000
were small squatty

60
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,159
and I almost took on the same traits

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,219
September October or when on Wednesday

62
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,799
all year yeah like you'll if you look at

63
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,659
some of our because we uh we we farmed

64
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,879
10 acres of hemp and everything was this

65
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,680
way no matter what you know it's just

66
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,120
that's where we are that's our that's

67
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,920
our climate so most of our sets from the

68
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,719
greenhouse so we're able to control so

69
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,899
what

70
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:19,280
but as traits go they all took on the

71
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:23,900
same environmental traits to stay alive

72
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,900
you know staying really really strong

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,319
they definitely took out those traits

74
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,680
that's that's high desert 3200 that's

75
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:36,179
that's completely opposite right so I

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,819
wanna I need still need to come check

77
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,819
out your place but there's also this guy

78
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,619
like an Anza uh who I've always wanted

79
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:46,500
to go visit like I used to grow up in

80
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:50,158
sepango which was like

81
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:54,919
at elevation right off the coast just

82
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,919
intense sunlight and uh

83
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:02,180
it was interesting growing like the

84
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:05,339
ruggedness of plants there versus like

85
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:08,760
where I am in L.A like

86
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,840
a nice gentle like Santa Monica Breeze

87
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,840
like perfect temperature

88
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:19,019
yeah I think the Cannabis kind of mimics

89
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,660
its growth in its in its high as well

90
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,519
you know you got that Santa Monica weed

91
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,060
and you're gonna kind of have a nice

92
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,060
mellow

93
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,000
drawing your words out a little bit more

94
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,620
feel the need to go to the ocean

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,418
so what do you think of the Durban I

96
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,399
like it I like it I like it it's a it's

97
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:41,939
a morning weed it's something that you

98
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,339
you know you check emails too

99
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:46,639
it makes you go shit and get stuff done

100
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,638
yeah

101
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:58,679
so what are what are uh cultivator is

102
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,299
telling you for this year like what are

103
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,400
they psyched about what are they what

104
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,560
are they growing and then what do they

105
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,000
stressed about

106
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,100
this shirt seems we have a little bit

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,439
more excitement in the industry

108
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,720
yeah I feel like

109
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:15,478
those who are still here in Humboldt

110
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,419
County with and and on

111
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:20,039
the traditional Market in general or

112
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,019
they're here to stay

113
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,819
they've weathered the storm the price of

114
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,978
weed it seems to be stabilizing

115
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:29,879
traditional Market I mean people are

116
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:31,918
building brands with like packaging on

117
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,259
the traditional Market I feel like those

118
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,019
people are like like for me I've always

119
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:40,319
kind of been like I would rather operate

120
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:43,500
outside the regulated market and jump

121
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,519
back in when it's sensible versus like

122
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,579
when you're

123
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,379
being a business with a weight vest I

124
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:50,639
feel like a lot of folks feel that way

125
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,019
right now

126
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,120
um

127
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:56,279
it's hard I mean most of us came from

128
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,079
the traditional market so we we

129
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,959
empathize with those who are in it but

130
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,758
then we we have folks that took the leap

131
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,219
as well and we want to root for them in

132
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,139
the same regard so

133
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,820
something needs to change the White

134
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,038
Market needs to be something that people

135
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,839
can exist on and

136
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,279
I don't I'm not going to sit there and

137
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,038
preach more regulation on the

138
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:20,000
traditional Market but it sure is easy

139
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:23,339
to exist in that Realm

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,139
are you uh in terms of genetics you're

141
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,000
seeing people talking about for this

142
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:30,300
year like I'm seeing people move towards

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,800
like sours hazes it seems like we're

144
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,840
getting a little bit more of a

145
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,699
Resurgence on sativa

146
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,500
uh traditionally it's been a difficult

147
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:42,360
one to bring to Market it takes forever

148
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:45,538
to grow uh it's very niche in a way uh

149
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,879
people are I I often compare the

150
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,560
Cannabis industry to 18 year olds

151
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,600
learning to drink they don't know what

152
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,720
they want they don't know if they want

153
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,560
vodka or they don't know

154
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,000
you would whether I was like 13 17 or

155
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,418
today you would have never caught me

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,579
with like a wine cooler or like Still

157
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:11,698
Still when I was 18. I was like I had

158
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:14,399
more taste uh yeah weight loss well and

159
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,500
that's why Brands like like 710 get

160
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,839
recognition because there are people out

161
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,060
there that are scrupulous about what

162
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,619
they enable 710's always been

163
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,280
interesting to me because they've always

164
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:30,918
been there and like in the Market at

165
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:33,779
scale and like with positive reviews

166
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,459
and now it's the flowers right right and

167
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:38,279
and they're one of the companies that

168
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:40,198
goes one of the best ones that go yeah

169
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:43,978
no that's that's the price

170
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,819
you don't like it I don't care I don't

171
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:46,978
care

172
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:49,979
so and I respect the hell out of that if

173
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:52,439
if everyone in the industry had the

174
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:54,180
ability to do that and there are reasons

175
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,879
all the way around the board why we

176
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,759
can't well we wouldn't have prices as

177
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,959
low as they are but it seems like you

178
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,340
guys were talking about it seems like

179
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,138
some bigger players are moving to that

180
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:05,579
direction yep there's some things

181
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,519
happening to where we're looking to see

182
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,439
a floor for cannabis to be you know

183
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,899
somewhat

184
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,959
stabilized at a minimum price but it

185
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:18,060
takes the largest distributors in this

186
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,279
state to come to some sort of a

187
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,500
realization that they have as much

188
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,119
control over what the industry does

189
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,098
sounds like things are moving in the

190
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,220
right direction and we could be seeing

191
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:32,458
like you know a 700 floor on mixed like

192
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,918
cannabis and as soon as we stabilize one

193
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,538
of these different

194
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,338
platforms the rest will fall in line

195
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:40,918
it's the one thing we're lacking from

196
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:44,099
say the wine industry or find what fine

197
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:46,379
alcohol is we don't have that regulatory

198
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:50,519
board that places a value on this

199
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:53,039
product and with the dog eat dog

200
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:57,600
industry it's been erased to the bottom

201
00:08:53,039 --> 00:09:00,000
so people are optimistic that like per

202
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,700
pound prices are gonna go or at least

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
stabilize they absolutely will here's

204
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,320
what's happened this industry

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,839
exploded because everyone thought that

206
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,420
it was a safe bet the price of weed was

207
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,600
through the roof it was low risk money

208
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:17,939
came from everywhere and we saw these

209
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,820
multi-state you know operations come up

210
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,339
we saw all this canopy space fly up

211
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,580
through development well guess what as

212
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:28,140
it turns out it isn't that easy and

213
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,480
there's nothing

214
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,919
there's not as much money being funneled

215
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,420
into this industry right now because

216
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,338
it's a little bit higher risk than

217
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:37,319
everyone anticipated yeah there's a lot

218
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,959
of there's a lot of debts with dropping

219
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,660
prices right so

220
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:44,699
those who have weathered this storm are

221
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:46,019
gonna command some respect in the

222
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,640
industry they're going to command the

223
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,679
price they deserve they figured out how

224
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,899
to do it on the some of the most hostile

225
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,239
conditions on the planet well that's why

226
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:57,379
for a lot of like the small farmers it

227
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,839
for me it's just kind of like if you can

228
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:04,439
survive for another year and a half like

229
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:08,220
and so they can sell

230
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,339
like that small appellation driven Farm

231
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:14,639
being able to sell to Minnesota or New

232
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:17,459
York or I tell you this industry has

233
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,319
made us lean and mean yeah every single

234
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:21,958
one of the Farms out there ex that that

235
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,540
are running have had to reevaluate their

236
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,639
costs what their time's worth what's

237
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:29,219
worth paying for and what's doing you

238
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,679
know what's not worth doing at all uh

239
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,839
before that the prices didn't justify

240
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,338
such conservative Behavior we had a lot

241
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,860
of things that happened in the industry

242
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:40,700
that weren't beneficial

243
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:44,159
so it's going to be an interesting and

244
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,379
new age for our Farms because they are

245
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,939
they're operating at a higher efficiency

246
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:51,778
than they've ever dreamed that they

247
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,839
could in order to survive yeah and it's

248
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:56,338
just gonna continue to give them

249
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,740
opportunities for Success moving through

250
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,660
the industry as it matures from state to

251
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,339
state it's a two-way path too they're

252
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:05,639
they're finally figuring out what

253
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:07,440
overhead is yeah no that's that's one

254
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,899
and then two they're figuring out dang I

255
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,720
really have to have a nice hamburger so

256
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,639
it was really really tasty here or else

257
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,560
my restaurant's not going to succeed and

258
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,199
that's just the analogy there it's like

259
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,639
you have to have a good product and so

260
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,379
we're getting we're that's where we're

261
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,000
kind of seeing a little bit of signs too

262
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,439
it's cool they get to see it on the on

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,259
that end we get to see a little bit on

264
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,260
this end it's they're coming to you know

265
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:34,139
for Solutions on how to differentiate

266
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:36,179
the product a little bit so it's it's so

267
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:38,639
I have an important question when Todd

268
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:40,578
eats a hamburger who's ham Burger does

269
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,419
the yeast

270
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:44,419
who makes this delicious

271
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't eat my own hamburgers but it's

272
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:49,740
funny

273
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,120
on being on the road a lot and just

274
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,159
going to the Farms actually go

275
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,539
everywhere and everywhere I go I like to

276
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,139
just try a hamburger soup and hamburger

277
00:11:54,539 --> 00:12:00,480
gnarly is a restaurant

278
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:02,759
because it gives you an idea of standard

279
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,959
you know what I mean tells me a lot

280
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,958
about the local community

281
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,760
wow we're smoking yeah the food last

282
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:19,160
night was awesome yeah

283
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:19,159
the salads yeah yeah that's right

284
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:35,459
I went to Reno to visit my cousins

285
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,740
and I like the visual in my head of what

286
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:41,879
to expect hanging out in Reno was kind

287
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:44,399
of like Vegas but dumpier

288
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:46,320
but it was cool no no yeah Vegas but

289
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,958
dumpier no offense to anyone that's out

290
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,600
in that area is like Atlantic City

291
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:54,719
no but my point is Reno isn't dumpier no

292
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,079
it's it's nice it's cool ten years ago

293
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,940
12 years ago Reno yeah not so much it

294
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,879
was kind of a scary place at a time but

295
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,920
yeah it's not not too bad now

296
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,338
but uh

297
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:11,219
like we ate at this German restaurant

298
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:13,260
and it was amazing and I was like and we

299
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,940
had gone the first restaurant we wanted

300
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,860
to go to was this Japanese restaurant

301
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,440
and we walked in there and it was two

302
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,778
packs like we couldn't get a table but I

303
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,720
was like I want to eat here and so like

304
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:27,179
all the restaurants were really good

305
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,680
uh sex with uh

306
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:30,679
last night's food

307
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:37,139
so what I mean are you seeing um

308
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,120
like when you're talking to people about

309
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,980
what they what

310
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,100
what they want to grow for the market

311
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:46,940
this year

312
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:49,800
like my genetics

313
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,899
you know we've been we've been working

314
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,240
with a lot of breeders as of late with

315
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,879
Eric and stuff too and you know I like

316
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,100
your own cultivation uh what's that for

317
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,019
your uncle oh our own cultivation well

318
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,180
down in San Diego we're kind of the gray

319
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:05,100
area but this year I think just just for

320
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:08,359
just for uh our heads we're gonna be

321
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,360
popping some 808s

322
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,059
exploring foreign

323
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,698
exactly which one but between those two

324
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,219
I think that's what we're gonna go for

325
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:16,500
that's what he had recommended too so on

326
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,079
the hand side I had like of an entire

327
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:23,100
crop what percentage of it's going to

328
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:25,559
flower tincture gummies bombs like so we

329
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,820
did we did a pretty good round and uh

330
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,278
and are you single source with

331
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,680
everything like yeah that's an awesome

332
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,320
story so all the tinctures are like we

333
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:37,458
grew it I mean that's our story I was

334
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,459
making I want to see a video

335
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:48,299
[Laughter]

336
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,639
he's the one that's gonna be doing that

337
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:53,099
so

338
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,799
what what percentage of your hemp sales

339
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,600
are flowers so we people would care

340
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,458
about like this okay oh we've been all

341
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,220
organized at this point the only flower

342
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:04,919
we have is CBG Madison and we actually

343
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,680
put that in pre-rolls uh because a lot

344
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,240
of the hip is hot we don't CBG had notes

345
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:14,059
did you bring any of that here in the

346
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,060
cpg do you smoke it by itself yeah

347
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:21,179
it actually feels really good there's

348
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:22,638
people that you know like

349
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:25,439
Julius

350
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,120
yeah a lot of other a lot of issues we

351
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,839
get a lot of good feedback on that the

352
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,600
teachers as well

353
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,339
let me see the lighter yeah CBG uh the

354
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,019
Matterhorn we roll that up as our flower

355
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:40,079
but that's why we're because we didn't

356
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,940
really see anything we really wanted and

357
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:45,120
thought we would enjoy to grow until we

358
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:47,360
But but so on the hemp side is your

359
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,639
mindset mostly

360
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,039
whatever I grew I'm growing for some

361
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:57,360
derivative derivative products like a

362
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:59,759
like a tincture a bomb a pill so you're

363
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,278
not focused on like the The Joint

364
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,439
smoking only in a portion of our

365
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:07,439
operation yeah so one greenhouse and

366
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,720
then a half acre is for uh is for

367
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,380
pre-rolls and for flour and then the

368
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,000
rest goes to ghost oil that's actually a

369
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,280
lot of square footage though the flowers

370
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,160
it is no it is yeah you said an acre

371
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:23,779
Plus or a half acre

372
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:26,279
of CBG goes to uh goes differently than

373
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:29,639
uh then like a like a ham genetics

374
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:31,440
actually more like like matterhorny I

375
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,840
guess you could call it sear it's not

376
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,259
it's not as bushy as like a as like a

377
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:39,199
you know a standard cherry wine or you

378
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:41,460
know t-crops or something like that yeah

379
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,038
they're very different so half acres

380
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,840
it's a lot but people like the pre-roll

381
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:48,119
so you just want to make sure it's fresh

382
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:51,480
because whatever whatever we didn't sell

383
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:53,399
previously we turned the oil like if I

384
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,319
was super high and wanted to like

385
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,360
downshift could I smoke one of those

386
00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:00,918
free rolls and do they taste good in

387
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:03,418
theory yeah

388
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,460
where you like have to smoke something

389
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,919
yeah like say you're trying to stop

390
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,360
smoking cigarettes sometimes you're like

391
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,480
all right I'm gonna I'm just gonna smoke

392
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:15,000
joints instead it's a very viable option

393
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,860
because you can if you smoke as many

394
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,419
joints as some people smoke cigarettes

395
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:20,939
well you're not getting a whole lot done

396
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:23,940
you might be Super Hyper like if you're

397
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,320
switching one to one like today's

398
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,419
cigarette you might have a little bit

399
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:30,058
better chance of remaining productive

400
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:32,400
joints a day and you know not going back

401
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:35,940
to smoking cigarettes but

402
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,860
uh they're really

403
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,620
for people who don't smoke a lot of

404
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:43,439
weeds CBD and CBG or you feel it way

405
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:45,259
more like interactive CBD makes me kind

406
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,720
of jittery

407
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:50,160
you know that's why I I don't that's why

408
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,558
I want to start trying different things

409
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,360
that's why we like CBG like and then we

410
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,819
do have a blend of smooth we actually go

411
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:59,219
80 20 so you get a little bit of the

412
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:02,339
because CBD does provide a little bit

413
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,740
more relaxation and CBG by itself CBG is

414
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,659
joint by itself actually it's pretty

415
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,220
it's pretty active it speaks to TiVo

416
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,538
well if you start to focus you get

417
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,798
rolling a little bit no I would love

418
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:14,940
that if it's like if it's like a ritalin

419
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,319
substitute and then it depends on the

420
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,500
person too I've noticed like someone

421
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,779
will come to me and say all right I I

422
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,179
I use this because I got to wind down my

423
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:27,538
THC this still gets me like it gets me

424
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:30,120
you know good relaxation or somebody who

425
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:31,200
needs to get uh tested or something but

426
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,058
still wants to smoke something other

427
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,038
than cigarettes that's really the you

428
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:38,038
get a lot of that you know well and also

429
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,779
take into consideration that THC in its

430
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:42,720
potency has been climbing over the years

431
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,859
yeah right so that's true in that

432
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,940
respect

433
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:49,379
the influence of the CBD bouquet has

434
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,960
always been kind of at lower

435
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,980
concentration so our interpretation of

436
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,600
what the effects of those chemicals are

437
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,400
are kind of subjective to the

438
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,279
concentrations that we're being exposed

439
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,519
to so what the effect of these different

440
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:08,399
flowers that are hemp derived have is

441
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:11,160
subjective and it's going to be yeah

442
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,440
continually changing it is for sure

443
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,860
same as like I

444
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,380
THC used to be in the single digits

445
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:22,558
yeah like and that was a high dose and

446
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,760
there were four teens was like yeah I

447
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,279
don't know about some of these 30

448
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,319
percenters in flour I'm like wait what

449
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,259
you're telling me that's 30 plus

450
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:35,099
apparently it's out there it's crazy be

451
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:37,619
fast shit so on the uh

452
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:38,939
like the 808s or are you growing those

453
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:40,979
commercially or just at home just

454
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,019
suggest that you know we preserve a

455
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,759
small little part of our Greenhouse just

456
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:47,279
for Eric and I and the group's little

457
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:50,099
head and you know six to 12 clients in

458
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,480
there and what uh what lines we're doing

459
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:53,699
808 I think we're doing 80 and then

460
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,200
cannabis Corey has some really good ones

461
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,000
and then we actually picked Eric Picks

462
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,400
Them Up from Hawaii like it's a really

463
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,259
cool Citrus ones I think there's like a

464
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,559
papaya in there too so just like the fun

465
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:08,058
we're gonna pop those too

466
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:08,058
yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be fun

467
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,579
we just you know we like to in our area

468
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,919
we could go three rounds

469
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:19,619
so we can it's fun to just kind of keep

470
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:23,520
hopping and keep rolling

471
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:26,759
sorry you like dapping twice uh really

472
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:29,779
big or mid-February and then on one of

473
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,779
the greenhouses we

474
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,280
and then eventually you have to dip it

475
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:43,678
as the it starts to get longer right

476
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,658
okay so at the very end you're dapping

477
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,480
of that first into November yeah the

478
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:50,400
first call by by then yeah we're well

479
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,779
then we're open then we're all we're all

480
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,538
the way open right now probably a little

481
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:56,279
bit that's the wrong part of it yeah but

482
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:58,019
the temperatures are good like you don't

483
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,359
you know it's actually like Eric was

484
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:02,900
saying our greenhouses work better on

485
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:05,000
the on the other ends of Summer right

486
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,860
it's time

487
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,440
like we get rad you know like really

488
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:13,439
nice early you know early round flowers

489
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,538
it's great because it's if you walk in

490
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,519
there without any fans without any uh

491
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:20,720
wet wallets

492
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,720
was perfect yeah

493
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,159
no I love like if I had a group like

494
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,319
SoCal in general the fact that I could

495
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,840
like my garden all year long is just

496
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,658
going and there's never it's like

497
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:35,939
Seasons bleed into each other the plants

498
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:38,700
kind of go this way they go like they're

499
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:41,000
all it's funny and I'm like if I had a

500
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,019
greenhouse in SoCal

501
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,460
that'd be ideal like this year was

502
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:46,440
different you know we got really early

503
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,120
season rain and all of a sudden it got

504
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,500
sunny and I was like whoa a couple of

505
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:51,899
those balloons pretty much pretty early

506
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,519
I hope I didn't miss the the flower pop

507
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,900
so like we're gonna hurry up and go down

508
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,418
to the desert just in case because

509
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,919
usually it would be like you know six

510
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,919
weeks from now so I don't know if it's

511
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:04,080
like it's uh early pop and then if we

512
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,580
get a freeze uh-oh then we're gonna get

513
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,960
we're gonna lose a lot of fruit fishing

514
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:08,579
that's kind of what's scary too so I bet

515
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,900
like all your avocado Growers and like

516
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:12,000
all the there's a lot of different girls

517
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,798
are probably sitting on their a little

518
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,900
nervous right now going dang dude I hope

519
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:17,579
I don't get a second freeze or else all

520
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,280
my flowers in the freezing off yeah

521
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:21,960
they'll have no no fruit this year so

522
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:24,658
this is yeah it's pretty interesting how

523
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,519
nature just decides whether you're gonna

524
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:31,320
make or break you know it's I got a lot

525
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:31,319
of rain yay oh no well

526
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,839
hopefully we get some more

527
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,580
Southern influenced wet weather coming

528
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:41,759
our way Southern influence yeah yeah

529
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:43,079
we've been very blessed so far well do

530
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,900
you live in Humboldt or where do you

531
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:48,298
live so in Humboldt okay yeah

532
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,340
wasn't we got a lot of rain just like

533
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:54,000
everyone else but I'm just so close to

534
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:56,538
the coast nothing floods so we we did

535
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,759
pretty well but

536
00:23:56,538 --> 00:24:02,099
lots of water came down we've got full

537
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,200
Lakes now yeah and hopefully they keep

538
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,240
it as long as possible more rain would

539
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,460
be nice Definitely some more snowpack

540
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,079
but it's interesting you guys say from

541
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,460
the from the south because where we're

542
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:12,839
from it would be from it would be from

543
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,600
the north and by the time that thing

544
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:17,399
spins up let's go and shooting back up

545
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,500
from the south that's that's you know

546
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,298
what I mean but for us it's we're coming

547
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,500
like oh there's the north winds so you

548
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:24,418
guys are all there's the South Winds

549
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,919
yeah you know what I mean yeah

550
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,900
that's crazy

551
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,679
but it's Humboldt County is one of those

552
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,380
places it's like 55 or 60 degrees 350

553
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,380
days a year

554
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:39,840
it it just stays the same temperature

555
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:42,000
daytime daytime night time I mean it'll

556
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,899
be cool off maybe into the 40s at night

557
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,019
but it's in in the lowlands of Humboldt

558
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:51,840
next to the coast it's like 55 60. yeah

559
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:54,240
that's awesome all the time but again a

560
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,579
45 minute drive Inland and you're at 100

561
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,620
degrees in the summer you can go skiing

562
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:02,538
in the winter and surfing and surfing in

563
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:02,538
the same day if you want to do the Trek

564
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:09,558
all right should we wrap this yeah I

565
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:09,558
probably should get back to a booth

566
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:15,838
