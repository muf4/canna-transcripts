00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,359
the listeners a co some context you're

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,439
originally

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,039
vegetable fruit farmers

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,399
traditional farmers then you got into

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,720
cannabis i don't know the details

15
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,719
exactly so maybe let me know you know

16
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,759
how you guys got started in cannabis

17
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,159
yeah well the um it's kind of funny uh

18
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,000
yeah 28 years ago

19
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,878
we started growing uh

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,480
peaches and tomatoes and lettuce and

21
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,439
that's been our you know sole source of

22
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,279
income

23
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,439
from the beginning

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,799
but you know here i am a certified

25
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,558
organic long-haired guy

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,878
in humboldt county and so every time i

27
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,439
tell people like yeah i'm a peach farmer

28
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,198
in humboldt county certified organic you

29
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,119
know and people would just kind of nod

30
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:04,640
and go sure sure

31
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:07,519
so after being like stereotyped for most

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,960
of my farming career as i was like

33
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,719
always like everybody was like that's

34
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,000
why he's successful he's he's a dope

35
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,560
grower you know grows weed and uh and it

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
wasn't true and so that's funny yeah and

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,079
so we finally got to this point where

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,799
like with lee you know like the medical

39
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,280
uh legalization happened and we didn't

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,840
jump on it we were like no no no we're

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,000
more fruit farmers and and then uh but

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,200
that stereotype or that like everybody

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,200
had me like pigeonholed and so then when

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,118
uh recreational came around we kind of

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,880
looked at each other and there had been

46
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,879
that the property we owned there had

47
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,478
been a like an illegal

48
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,560
you know uh

49
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,280
patch um in the back

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,719
and

51
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,320
we just kind of looked at each other and

52
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,478
we were like why not it's a

53
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,000
diversification for the farm like we

54
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,118
grow everything else really beautifully

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,200
i'd love to see what we could do with

56
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,599
that plant right and uh we've both had a

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,079
relationship with cannabis for you know

58
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,280
since i was 12. a long time been growing

59
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,679
it have you been growing it for that

60
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,840
backyard yeah backyard backyard growing

61
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,800
yeah you know just just for ourselves

62
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,360
and so we just like we've been like you

63
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,879
know tried to just stay totally white

64
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,480
market and um enjoy the plants and uh

65
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,878
because first couple of years we just

66
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,759
grew this amazing diversity like uh

67
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:21,759
through

68
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,079
diversity of cannabis strains yeah and

69
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,318
just really seeing like what the plant

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,319
was capable of for sure yeah you gotta

71
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,159
test it out in your soil and the soils

72
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,039
you have the certified organic soil you

73
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,120
guys are in truly native soils yeah

74
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,799
it's beautiful bottom land yeah you have

75
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,640
really nice that little

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,319
terrace it's probably like the alluvial

77
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,279
flood plain where it's like really high

78
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,878
grade soil yeah yeah i mean we on that

79
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,360
same you know we with all of our other

80
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,239
crops there we rotate our crops and

81
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,720
we'll

82
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,640
grow melons corn carrots like no water

83
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,800
at all you know it's just like dry farm

84
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,958
dry farmed yeah and so do you think does

85
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,200
your cannabis require any i mean we

86
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,400
water our cannabis but like

87
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,719
it's really about like what's your

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,039
definition of dry farming we water it so

89
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:09,120
little minimum yeah yeah and we use a

90
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,919
drip it's buried um and uh but yeah it's

91
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,439
um

92
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,000
we i think this year we're actually

93
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:17,519
putting a meter on it it's really the

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,519
um we'll go a month at a time without

95
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,280
watering it amazing yeah it's um

96
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,120
it's a beautiful crop it's it's

97
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,280
perfectly suited for our location you

98
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,200
guys have a perfect spot i i it's really

99
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,919
nice it's like that cutty little terrace

100
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,199
there's high recharge rates from the

101
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,280
groundwater

102
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,158
coming through and it just helps

103
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,400
elevate the water tables to where it

104
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,318
seems like it keeps you know the soil

105
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
moisture so it's really beautiful i love

106
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,238
that spot is i'm just curious with the

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,158
diversification of your other crops i'm

108
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,560
just for the record how many different

109
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,919
species of vegetables do you grow yeah

110
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,360
like i mean that's a hard question i

111
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,438
don't know like we you know with the

112
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,400
like with the you know one thing that we

113
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,919
committed to like we really enjoy like

114
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,599
growing the cannabis but we also said

115
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,238
when we started to do this we were like

116
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,759
we can't not we can't not grow food or

117
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,759
we can't slow down like we still have

118
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,759
that commitment to feed our community

119
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,679
and that's what the farm is like based

120
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,479
on is feeding our community you know

121
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,760
healthy food keep your community healthy

122
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,399
and so

123
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,079
um we still like

124
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,519
produce we actually produce more than we

125
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,639
ever have um so we have like um peaches

126
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,879
we have 18 different varieties

127
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,918
fruit trees in general we have like 1600

128
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,680
trees

129
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,519
so um

130
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,600
you know and then the tomatoes 20

131
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,839
different varieties um

132
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,240
melons eight different varieties you

133
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,039
know so it's just corn and squash yeah

134
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,759
15 varieties of plua you know do you do

135
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,680
other

136
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,040
root vegetables like potatoes or onions

137
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
or carrots ever

138
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,120
yeah it depends every year what we do is

139
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,600
we watch and see how the rain falls see

140
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,280
where the how tall the cover crop gets

141
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,040
when is our last

142
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,839
you know rain event all that really um

143
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,759
tells us what we can grow interesting

144
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,319
some years when it's a really dry spring

145
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,400
it's like okay no carrots you know yeah

146
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,800
wet spring great carrots interesting so

147
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:14,638
you're really truly reading the cycles

148
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,960
yeah we have big totes of seed and big

149
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,840
mason jars of pounds of seeds oh that's

150
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,439
amazing um so and in years we don't use

151
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,799
you know carrots we don't grow them at

152
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,879
all and then the next year it's a big

153
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,319
year so i feel like i want to talk to

154
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,560
you it's not the appropriate time to

155
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,879
talk about carrot cross pollination but

156
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,478
maybe afterwards um

157
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,478
so

158
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,719
as far as your cannabis goes i do find

159
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,560
it interesting that you're in basically

160
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,240
completely native soil

161
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
there's not many farms out there that

162
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,759
are in sometimes it's mixed with potting

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,918
soil sometimes but

164
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,600
to be in uh native soil if you found any

165
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,120
unique challenges with that or if you

166
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,360
feel like your plants like health-wise

167
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,840
have responded i think that's been

168
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,960
amazing only beneficial yeah

169
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,758
we

170
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,079
like

171
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,879
i have to go to neighboring farms to see

172
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,359
what

173
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,079
diseases and past infestations look like

174
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,160
like we don't our our plants like and

175
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,000
we've learned this with with other

176
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,840
things like the peach trees or the or

177
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,639
the tomatoes like

178
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,758
um

179
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,319
you know

180
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,280
when you start with good genetics and

181
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,600
uh

182
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,719
you and especially like growing from

183
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,319
seed like you get that that plant really

184
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,400
wants to have a authentic root system um

185
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,240
and uh when you grow something that

186
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:33,679
vital and that healthy um that's like 99

187
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,478
of uh you know keeping pests and disease

188
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,439
away you know not getting greedy

189
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:41,279
not not pumping a plant with a lot of

190
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,959
fertility that's what i've noticed i've

191
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,879
basically noticed like essentially when

192
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,879
you get greedy and you try to pump the

193
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,319
plant with extra water the root systems

194
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,079
don't develop as much because they don't

195
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,840
need to and then if it dries out the

196
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,598
plant's going to suffer or if you

197
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,159
conversely pump it with fertilizer the

198
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,079
plant grows too rapidly where it's

199
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,240
essentially immune system can't keep up

200
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,000
with itself and then it's attacked yep

201
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,840
and it also like with the root system

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,279
it'll if you put too much fertility in

203
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,439
the root system grows a little and goes

204
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,198
oh there's plenty here i don't there's

205
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,120
plenty of water right here too so the

206
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,520
root system doesn't really go for it

207
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,959
whereas like with that native soil you

208
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,799
really want to um

209
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,478
you know you want to get it like you

210
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,120
want to get those roots searching so you

211
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:24,240
want to have nice loose porous you know

212
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,918
we do like uh we actually um mulch all

213
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,160
our beds in a permanent bed system and

214
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,639
we actually harvest the hay

215
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,880
on the farm oh that's beautiful so you

216
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,879
guys are actually closing the loop

217
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,639
to that degree with mulch so you're

218
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,079
harvesting your hay is it on the same

219
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,680
plot or that on your other farm it's

220
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,038
like in the gym

221
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,280
same spot okay so you're harvesting the

222
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,038
hay and the haze used for mulch for the

223
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,279
cannabis and the hay is actually the

224
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,478
cover crop that we like get so it's like

225
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,679
yeah

226
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,279
right

227
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,959
oh yeah so there's yeah so some things

228
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,679
like the veg and the bell beans they'll

229
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:58,000
like melt into fertility really quickly

230
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,439
whereas the oats in the rye they provide

231
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,639
layering yeah they'll be a little more

232
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,959
residual it sounds like a really

233
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,280
interesting bio biodiverse system using

234
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,719
a cover crop as mulch that's interesting

235
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,079
i haven't heard i mean most of the times

236
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,919
every time you hear of cover crop it's

237
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,199
always tilled in

238
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,519
you know and i've i've definitely

239
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,598
mulched some stuff but i've only done i

240
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,839
don't like using grasses i didn't

241
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,439
because they will regrow

242
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,878
one it's scary too because you might be

243
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:25,279
incorporating like some uh perennial uh

244
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,720
grass with rhizome right that you never

245
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,719
know what you're getting so when you're

246
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,199
actually bringing it from your own farm

247
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,959
you know you know that's really cool huh

248
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,800
that's really interesting

249
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,119
and do you feel like have you noticed

250
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,559
like you know your the terpene

251
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,639
expression in the plants are better

252
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,239
because of these management practices

253
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,519
like are you just used to it because

254
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,759
well that's kind of some of the feedback

255
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,440
we're getting is that the terpene

256
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,439
are really

257
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,360
stellar nice yeah that's awesome we're

258
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,360
just you know we're just

259
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,080
working it yeah it's really cool and you

260
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,919
guys been doing it since 2018

261
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,120
17 17. cool right yeah that's awesome

262
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,479
that's really exciting there's probably

263
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,639
a bunch more questions i'll think of

264
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,759
later but i live like five minutes away

265
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,360
so i can always

266
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,319
i've always thought you know if we if we

267
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,120
didn't grow cannabis um in a in a

268
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,879
commercial way i would still want plants

269
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,639
around the farm like one of the things

270
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,080
that i've been amazed at is it's the

271
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,919
interaction with the environment that

272
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,600
that plant has and the beneficial

273
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,000
insects

274
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,720
is just like it's a benefit to the whole

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
farm like it's i would love it's too bad

276
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,560
that we actually have to keep it in this

277
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,639
very controlled contained like you put

278
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,000
it here yeah cause i'd actually love to

279
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,759
have a couple plants there a couple

280
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,839
couples they're like i love spread that

281
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,360
love i've been doing some autoflowers

282
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,440
with humboldt seed the last few years

283
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,839
he's been giving me some and i've loved

284
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,160
inner cropping

285
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,519
root vegetables with cannabis i had this

286
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:52,799
50 foot row of carrots just right next

287
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,759
to the cannabis the autoflowers and

288
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,919
it was insane i had no idea that the

289
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,439
carrots all of the above ground growth

290
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,360
could create such a bank for lady

291
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,760
beetles there were lady beetles the

292
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,560
whole the whole row of carrots and then

293
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,240
they all reproduced on the autoflower

294
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,319
leaves like then they all went from

295
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,680
there and the eggs were on the underside

296
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,879
of all the autoflowers i was just like

297
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,399
blown away

298
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,958
how amazing that inner cropping system

299
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,399
was of course it required a lot of water

300
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,119
and fertilization where i'm at

301
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,278
unfortunately we i got hit with the

302
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,519
gravel bar of the river terrace so i've

303
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,480
had to implement some other practices

304
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,679
bringing in fertility with mulching

305
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,240
but anyways

306
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,759
um so that's really i'm i'm just really

307
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,278
excited to hear you guys management

308
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,360
practices it's a really beautiful

309
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,958
example of like closing the loop and

310
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,000
creating more of a regenerative system

311
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,239
that's like

312
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,759
you know long-term regenerative not just

313
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,799
sustainable so yeah we're trying right

314
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,439
now we're actually doing this thing

315
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,120
where we're um we're aging wood chips

316
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,279
for about two years

317
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,919
um and then we're

318
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,838
putting other uh farm-grown green manure

319
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,439
cover crop uh putting that in with the

320
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,600
aged wood chips

321
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,920
and trying to do like we're doing uh

322
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,519
goat uh manure and chicken uh bedding so

323
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,278
chicken oh yeah that stuff's great and

324
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,000
uh we're putting that all in and making

325
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:12,240
a like a biocomplete compost using

326
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,399
elaine ingham soil food web really

327
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,560
that's actually so right now the um the

328
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,399
fertility on the farm is actually 100

329
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,759
from the farm from the farm so it really

330
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,759
is closed loop

331
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,159
trying and you got you said goats yeah

332
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,240
you guys have goats

333
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,000
yeah goats are tricky and that's really

334
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
fascinating walter was talking about you

335
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,360
know harvesting wood chips

336
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,880
and then letting them sit in the forest

337
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,159
and they would collect the mycelium and

338
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,039
then building but you guys are creating

339
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,639
like very unique biodynamics well not

340
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,559
biodynamic but yeah well there's you

341
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,559
know the wood chips and the in the

342
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,319
biology from the forest and the fungi

343
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,159
and everything like that's a huge part

344
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,640
of it you got to grow what is it what is

345
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,078
the biodynamic compost yarrow chamomile

346
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,879
valerian

347
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:52,958
yeah

348
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,200
yeah that's and that's even more

349
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,679
different that's like that's a different

350
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,000
spiritual path we grow up we grow all

351
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,319
those plants in our beds yeah of the

352
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,600

plants all in different so there's

354
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,200
living under yeah under the plants

oh it's beautiful those things like in

359
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,958
underneath the plants oh that's really

360
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,399
cool that would make you guys have fun i

361
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,719
would love to see photos of that if you

362
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,799

363
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,639

364
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,958
cool yeah that's beautiful

365
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,399
right on um all right well i mean i feel

366
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,799
like i asked you a ton of i bet you have

367
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,639
tons of really cool management questions

368
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,879
methodology questions that i could ask

369
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,039
you but i guess for time's sake maybe

370
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,320
let's think about um

371
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,879
uh your

372
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,959
what do you think would be the one thing

373
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,320
you'd change in the industry like if you

374
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,559
had to change something with education

375
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,760
or regulation we've been asking all the

376
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,199
farmers like what do you feel like would

377
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,480
most you know create the highest level

378
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,079
of impact

379
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,278
uh with for the small candidates first

380
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,759
regulation then education sure yeah yeah

381
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:00,720
less barriers to entry and then

382
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,559
you know then take the time to educate i

383
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,079
think i think they both the education

384
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,359
there's been a lot of talk today about

385
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,838
like education for the the dispensary

386
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,480
level where thcs shouldn't be as

387
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,880
important understanding or terpenes yeah

388
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,200
secondary uh minor cannabinoids and all

389
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,600
of that in education then for the

390
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,600
regulation side there's been all talk of

391
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,600
direct-to-consumer sales

392
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,759
that was been pretty hot

393
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,600
and then obviously eliminate cultivation

394
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,919
taxes and things yeah i think something

395
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,480
that might be unique to us is like we've

396
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:36,639
been um exploring

397
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,879
the new um ocal or ocan okay ocal

398
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,839
and oh yeah yeah and so the organic

399
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,320
cannabis and that's really hard because

400
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,880
we're just a farm and so

401
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,639
uh we need the distributor to be

402
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,958
certified you need the processor to be

403
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,440
certified oh really and if they're not

404
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,479
wow they can't they can't put that

405
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,240
seriously

406
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,720
in processor also

407
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,278
yeah everybody everybody online

408
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,800
wow so so the fact that we could get

409
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:03,919
certified and pay all this money to be

410
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,039
certified

411
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:09,039
um our cannabis would never never say

412
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,278
organic or wow

413
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,759
organic does it do they do that in other

414
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,399
agricultural crops well you know we've

415
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,879
been certified organic you know since

416
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,278
the beginning and since the nop the

417
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,559
national organic program and um

418
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,879
and we're certified our farm is

419
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,479
certified by ccof um

420
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,838
and

421
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,879
back when it started there were certain

422
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,160
things um

423
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,720
that like

424
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,120
they made allowances for things like you

425
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,600
couldn't get organic seed so they were

426
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,399
like okay if you can't find organic seed

427
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,600
you can use a conventional seed

428
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,120
organically

429
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,560
right and as long as you are growing

430
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,399
organic and you could still call that

431
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,958
you know if you grew a tomato from a

432
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,039
conventional seed you could you could

433
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,799
call it organic and so like little

434
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,240
tweaks to the rules like that make all

435
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,919
the difference and so right now they're

436
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,079
trying to get this organic certification

437
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,000
for cannabis off the ground

438
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,919
but they're being so militant about it

439
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,759
yeah it's like that is one foot in our

440
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,039
body right and here you know everybody

441
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,278
i'm sure has been talking about how the

442
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,958
small cannabis farmer is hurting right

443
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,120
now yeah and so here's something you

444
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,278
could really here's a a certification

445
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,039
that could really distinguish yeah

446
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,720
absolutely and it's like and you can't

447
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,719
go anywhere with it interesting wow

448
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,199
that's really lame i had no idea that

449
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,800
and processing and distribution also

450
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,319
don't forget don't forget they make they

451
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,719
not only grow really good cannabis but

452
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,079
they also grow really good peaches um

453
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,680
speaking of cannabis actually do you

454
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,559
have samples

455
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,399
can we get some samples

456
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,319
we can talk about the different thanks

457
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,958
that's the sapphire suit okay the

458
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,480
sapphire suit seven percent thc 22

459
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,319
cbd

460
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,560
now that sounds

461
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,160
pretty amazing i'm definitely as i get

462
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,159
older with all my sports related

463
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,719
injuries and my just like joint sort of

464
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,198
i've i'm leaning more towards the

465
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,639
higher cbd stuff and that's a one to one

466
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,559
oh man well that that at that test was

467
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,120
is basically kind of like a two

468
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,039
two it seems like a three to one almost

469
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,959
but that one test kind of it varies but

470
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,799
it varies depending on yeah sure yeah

471
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,799
the time when it was tested oh my gosh

472
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,639
it smells so good

473
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,120
that's a biovortex

474
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,039
this is a biovortex strain yep sapphire

475
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,440
soup that's like the farm favorite

476
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,919
that's actually anybody who comes and

477
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,519
tries that loves it do you guys are you

478
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:30,479
just doing flour that for that one

479
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,879
that one is actually made into a

480
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,800
a bho

481
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,519
oh you do yeah oh yeah but we didn't do

482
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,278
it but somebody else did it but then um

483
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,919
that this year is going to be for

484
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,799
pre-rolls oh okay yeah

485
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,479
um

486
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,319
yeah that's one that's like the farm

487
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,320
will always grow that one it's such like

488
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,879
the plant is so beautiful

489
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,560
that um it just we couldn't not leave it

490
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,480
off very easy to work with it's so fresh

491
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,399
nice takes weather

492
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,399
like beautifully another thing about our

493
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,360
farm is like there's there's nothing we

494
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,679
rely entirely on beneficial insects and

495
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,880
uh and companion planting like there's

496
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,640
beautiful

497
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,079
there's nothing this is probably why

498
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,079
i've got it's like i must have gotten

499
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,318
the download over the last few years

500
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,838
because that's what i'm in love with too

501
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,599
and the use of

502
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,399
an integrated system because we're

503
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,798
diversified as a farm we don't have to

504
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,120
rely on one crop so we've had years

505
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,558
where the tomatoes uh

506
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,479
you know get blight

507
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,000
but the peaches save us right and we've

508
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,319
had other years you know that the

509
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,160
peaches uh don't have a crop and the

510
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,599
tomatoes save us or the melons save us

511
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,840
so really so with the cannabis it's like

512
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,759
my concern about smoking other people's

513
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,720
weed is uh

514
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,200
like

515
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,038
if they have to pull off that crop

516
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,360
they're going to do everything yeah and

517
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,759
anything to pull off that crop yeah and

518
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,199
uh so with us it's like there'll be some

519
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,519
i'm sure there'll be some year where

520
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,519
there's nothing there and that's okay

521
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,200
because we've got all these other things

522
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,879
that'll save the key

523
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,160
this is you guys are the shining model

524
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,760
for the key for understanding diversity

525
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,679
it's true you know it's like i mean

526
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,919
really people that's the whole point

527
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,160
diversificate biodiversity is the

528
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,759
supreme ruler when you understand

529
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,160
if you're integrated if you're

530
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,400
integrated with all those systems

531
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,160
then you have the capacity for some to

532
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,160
fail and still be

533
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,519
you know saving and and maintain your

534
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,320
high standards

535
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,798
yes yes that's the thing we don't want

536
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,798
to spray anything yeah and like it would

537
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,480
not feel good to spray something so we

538
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,319
would rather deal with it differently

539
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,960
you guys feel like i mean i could talk

540
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,399
to you for hours probably what uh all

541
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,240
right i know we're not supposed to get

542
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,320
too deep but what are your

543
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,519
three or five favorite companion plants

544
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,918
which ones do you like the most for

545
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,400
attracting beneficials well

546
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,679
oh listen alyssa that's on my list the

547
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,080
top of the list

548
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,640
and then and then um this year i was

549
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,759
amazed at like the yarrow just kept

550
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,520
flowering it just loved the mulch and

551
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,200
the bed system love the yarrow but it

552
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,400
feels like it's invasive a little it

553
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,798
creeps a little bit but you know it

554
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,798
doesn't just pull little edges of it out

555
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,519
it's not like it's not a plant that's

556
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,798
like so hard not like comfrey yeah yeah

557
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,759
and then another you would never plant

558
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:13,359
coffee

559
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,200
she won't let me you know

560
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,839
but uh another one is it has this place

561
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,480
yeah but not in the cannabis okay

562
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,399
another one is uh oregano oh interesting

563
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,000
awesome amazing time

564
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,519
i love we have a ton of oregano and

565
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,519
thyme in our house too i like it those

566
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,119
are all antimicrobials yeah you think

567
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,279
about it on the spiritual like an

568
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,038
essence level yes in essence biochemical

569
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,720
it's like has a biochemical suppression

570
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,759
i've done some research that shows it

571
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,279
repels

572
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,200
insects pests they don't want to be

573
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,759
around that yeah and it's also got that

574
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,160
small flower that a lot of the

575
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,319
uh beneficials love yes i see oh my god

576
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,960

577
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,839
nuts over it that's cool so okay time

578
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,679

579
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,119
rosemary we have a lot of rosemary yeah

580
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,559
yeah you know and you the thing is is

581
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,399
you just come in and whack it and it's

582
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,079
like thank you and it goes on to you

583
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,679
know another it'll bloom several times

584
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,038
in a summer which is really oh it's

585
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,720
funny because i've never actually done

586
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,720
that so you can cut rosemary back oh

587
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,480
yeah yeah we cut it and it's just like

588
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,640
roses and then we have some others we

589
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,120
have some um like whether it's day

590
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,159
lilies or that that i'm still like i

591
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,359
don't know what it does but it's

592
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,559
beautiful

593
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,558
or the um

594
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,079
uh japanese anemone is another one

595
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:23,119
that's in the back and that's nice

596
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,240
because it comes uh in the fall so all

597
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,399
of a sudden you have these brand new

598
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,400
flowers in the fall the successional

599
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,559
blooming of the flowers is the key and

600
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,120
the diversity of the flowers yeah each

601
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:35,119
you know insect that wants what it wants

602
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,279
totally yep i've been growing a lot of

603
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,879
calendula yeah that's been receding a

604
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,480
lot in forage

605
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,559
another one that i love on the farm that

606
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,960
i used to i actually hurt my back one

607
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,639
year pulling it because i it was it

608
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,679
frustrated me so and then i realized

609
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,759
fennel no chicory chicken yeah chicory

610
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,360
used to come up my lawn and i hated it

611
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,440
and i was always trying to dig it out

612
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,399
and then i was looking for something

613
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,360
like

614
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,000
what blooms late in the year that you

615
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,158
don't have to water you know and um and

616
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,240
i realized chicory the thing is that it

617
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,600
blooms it blooms every morning you know

618
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,798
by the afternoon if you're walking

619
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,719
around it doesn't look like anything

620
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,119
special but it blooms every morning and

621
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,759
the the wasps and the bees are

622
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:18,399
interested in it so now i i went from

623
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,519
being like on my most hated list to like

624
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,960
now it's one of the things i love the

625
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,079
most oh that's so fun it's funny how

626
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,759
that works

627
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,798
people if they get more in tune with

628
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,960
their environment they'll see that

629
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,918
things aren't weeds or bad things they

630
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,440
can have a lot of potential

631
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,080
is there anywhere we can find your

632
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,640
product that you know yeah so we have

633
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:41,038
been working with a brand called simple

634
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,120
and they have um created a little

635
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,240
i guess they're eights i don't even know

636
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:48,158
um and there is the canada dog

637
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,679

fun contract with 710 labs

664
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,960

665
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,360
we had a really nice uh crop with them

666
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,798
this year um and then we're sitting on a

667
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,079
whole bunch of flour

668
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,240
and uh

669
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,399
but like yeah you know you guys are

670
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,919
diversified yeah all in due time yeah

671
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,919
and it's also it's like we said like

672
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,480
we're not desperate to get rid of it and

673
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,440
we also like aren't going to

674
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,960
take a price that's insulting and um

675
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,960
yeah it's understandable it's pretty

676
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,960
gnarly right now i'm glad we delayed

677
