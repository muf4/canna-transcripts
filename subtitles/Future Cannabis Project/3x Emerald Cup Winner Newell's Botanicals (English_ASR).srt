2
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:31,259
one of the surprises coming back again

3
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,808
this third year in a row is noticing how

4
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,700
many people are not here a lot of our

5
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:38,849
friends that have been here in the past

6
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,649
and I'm not here not for this well not

7
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,329
here participating they might be here at

8
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:46,950
the show it really we feel privileged to

9
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,960
actually make it past the first two

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,399
extinction event level events that have

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,719
moved a lot of people out of the

12
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,179
manufacturing products in the market

13
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,670
we're very thankful for our distributor

14
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,649
to help us get it past that point and

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:06,930
our manufacturing partner to help us

16
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:08,219
begin compliance but it's the landscape

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,868
is really changing and we're trying to

18
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:14,849
stay in it and trying to help our fellow

19
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:17,938
son grown cannabis folks stay in

20
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:20,899
business and the other thing I noticed

21
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:25,079
about the Emerald Cup this year is

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,840
there's a lot less we'd like this is the

23
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,420
hall of flowers right so there's no weed

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,310
sales in this room where we are but this

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,629
time last year there were so many people

26
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,909
walking around with blunts in their

27
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:39,118
mouths that this room was hot-boxed

28
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:43,140
and so what I'm noticing is despite

29
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:45,420
greater access to cannabis there's not a

30
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,799
whole lot of it here like where's the

31
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,868
guy with the blunt bandoliers

32
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,868
what happened to that that was awesome

33
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:58,320
no I'm definitely seeing the cannabis

34
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:59,539
industry evolve cannabis culture it's no

35
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,978
longer

36
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:05,640
justyou're Cheech and Chong kind of a

37
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:08,038
thing it's your your your mom pop Vado

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,050
are starting to use cannabis more the

39
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,599
boomers are actually using cannabis more

40
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:16,560
and you can tell that has changed the

41
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,759
whole industry that we work and it's

42
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,890
been interesting to watch that

43
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,689
development it's interesting to see how

44
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,979
it's playing out here at the beer

45
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:26,280
morolto everyone's bringing their

46
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:35,009
packaging game up the boxes are really

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:44,939
fly this year I have to say over the

48
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:47,189
last 12 months shared manufacturing

49
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:52,079
trying to find a location actually build

50
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:56,099
on trying to make sure that we we could

51
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,700
stay in business and then the BCC

52
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:04,199
regulations you know making that type of

53
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:06,209
manufacturing questionable and yeah and

54
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,518
then trying to find investment to

55
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:13,799
actually keep us floating and moving

56
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:17,759
forward it's it's a lot of all we're you

57
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:20,969
live it with me it's stressful so I

58
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:24,090
think for me the worst was when they

59
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:26,280
dropped the reg revision after the

60
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,620
45-day comment period and and

61
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,099
immediately banned our business model

62
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,739
with two weeks of comments allowed and

63
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:38,489
then they sent that off to the oh L to

64
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,829
get written into law so you know that

65
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,989
was it there's been multiple existential

66
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,150
crisis throughout the last year like are

67
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,689
we gonna survive this one that was the

68
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,359
worst

69
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:52,769
I had like a breakdown like I'm not

70
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:55,469
gonna be okay for a while but you know

71
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,359
what you come to figure out it's like no

72
00:03:55,469 --> 00:04:00,180
one's position in this industry is

73
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:03,659
guaranteed or secure and if you want to

74
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,480
keep if you want to be here month after

75
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:08,500
month year after year it's it basically

76
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,019
comes down to not quitting

77
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,750
how did you come to be in the cannabis

78
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:20,079
industry from your precision your

79
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:21,850
perspective okay at that point in time

80
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,529
we're talking like seven eight years ago

81
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:29,500
I was I was married to somebody who was

82
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:35,109
having really bad health problems due to

83
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:37,509
prescription medications and so I told

84
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,720
him he should start smoking weed instead

85
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:42,370
and it kind of led us down a path for a

86
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,330
while where we got really involved in

87
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:50,980
advocacy public speaking it shows like

88
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:54,219
this and then I just I kind of knew that

89
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:57,009
I just wanted to be around cannabis

90
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:01,690
nests and and where it was going that I

91
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:05,620
could actually fulfill my my kind of

92
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:10,029
inner drive to help people through this

93
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:15,340
new commercial pathway that was at that

94
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:17,859
point I'm just expanding right and you

95
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:20,289
know fast forward a bunch of years and I

96
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,540
had a lot of contacts in the industry

97
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,790
and a lot of jobs under my belt and

98
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:30,610
experience and a lot of cannabis

99
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:32,500
knowledge and so when I saw that the the

100
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:39,900
market in the topical space was

101
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:42,819
saturated with stinky sticky ineffective

102
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:47,709
smells like weed you know gunk

103
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:49,329
essentially I wasn't about to to

104
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:52,060
recommend something like that to my

105
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:54,939
grandma who you know was having hip

106
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,769
surgery and it's super Christian and

107
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:59,620
conservative I was gonna be like hearin

108
00:05:56,769 --> 00:06:02,409
an rub this weed cream on your body and

109
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,769
go to church just freakin to high heaven

110
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:08,710
know so we developed something just from

111
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:10,389
the ground to be to solve all those

112
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,949
problems to be easy to use to be

113
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,409
friendly to an old or more conservative

114
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:18,129
customer to not smell like we to be

115
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:20,080
highly efficacious and and I didn't

116
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:22,509
launch that as a product I just handed

117
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:26,859
that to my grandma

118
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:30,800
but the emerald-cut came around in 2016

119
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:35,120
and I decided to bottle some of it slap

120
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:39,110
a sticker on it and then we won it was

121
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:44,060
very unexpected how did you feel it

122
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:47,900
night in that moment from for myself

123
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:51,189
like when you came into my life and you

124
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:53,269
discovered me I was working on building

125
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:56,180
regenitive natural farming techniques

126
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:58,789
for cannabis because you know I came out

127
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,730
of my background is bioremediation

128
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,350
cleaning up the environment and I

129
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,950
realized a lot of the same techniques

130
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:11,570
could be used in agriculture to advance

131
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:13,339
natural crop production so I was I had

132
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:16,250
always been in Canada into cannabis as a

133
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:18,139
user and it was only in the last seven

134
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,709
to ten years that I got into it as like

135
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:24,199
breeder producer it was a good way to to

136
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:26,810
prove and validate agricultural

137
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,750
principles it's a high uptake plant if I

138
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,610
could prove that I could grow cannabis

139
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,339
well with these techniques I can grow

140
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,199
anything really well with it and the

141
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:38,209
other half it's it's a clean growing

142
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,060
technique you want a plant that's gonna

143
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:43,430
be clean for somebody using it for

144
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,990
potentially for their help and I was

145
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,840
seeing a lot of nasty products out there

146
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,280
I I hate hearing the statement what do

147
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,019
you do to flush bro

148
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,729
what do you mean flush what are you

149
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:54,829
talking about flush what is this flush

150
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:58,640
you speak of I don't have to flush shit

151
00:07:54,829 --> 00:08:00,199
I mean my plants they they're does does

152
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,149
nature flush I guess

153
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:06,289
fall rains that would be a flush but I

154
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:09,079
mean no no that's stupid so that's that

155
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:12,620
was my passion and getting into it when

156
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:15,050
I met Chelsea it's kind of a marriage

157
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:18,290
made in heaven she she does really great

158
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,150
plant work I do a lot of really good

159
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:23,930
soil work and together where we were

160
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:27,739
coming to the Emerald Club as a cannabis

161
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:30,749
consultant team for growing and chose to

162
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,000
enter it to kind of validate what we do

163
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:36,110
you know put in a flower entry put in a

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,578
topical product and ended up winning and

165
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,349
pivot to actually creating a business

166
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:44,250
around that but we really want to get

167
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:46,439
back to farming we we do this to support

168
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:49,649
I can't support our farming habit

169
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:51,629
essentially and so we haven't been able

170
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:54,958
to be on farm as much as we want to

171
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:57,089
right now and I don't want this the blow

172
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:01,169
up so I can go back to like tending

173
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:03,810
goats and sheep and chickens and plants

174
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:07,259
and and that's that's where I'd want to

175
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:09,659
be you know this is all fun and good and

176
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:11,970
it's helping people but I really just

177
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:13,588
want to get back on the land we're

178
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,019
working in association with farms right

179
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:16,470
now a few of them here being represented

180
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,889
in Boots

181
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,810
but we don't have our own farm that was

182
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:24,149
the whole purpose for us getting into

183
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:27,088
this was to actually get to them I might

184
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:29,278
as well plug our homies right so so two

185
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:32,310
of our source farms are son of us full

186
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,139
full Sun farms who won they've they've

187
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:36,448
won multiple top ten awards for their

188
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,519
flowers and their products like they're

189
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:41,278
manufactured products the other one is

190
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,799
green shock farms which is again one

191
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:48,149
multiple top ten Emerald cup awards for

192
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:50,128
their flowers and also turkeys last year

193
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:52,169
yeah they end up so he they do all their

194
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:54,449
own breeding in-house every year they

195
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:56,669
come with a fresh line of strains that

196
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:58,229
are completely unique and they're rockin

197
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:00,299
terpene profiles and no one's ever seen

198
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,579
before what did you do to differentiate

199
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,109
our product from the other things you

200
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:06,028
saw in the market you had spoken to the

201
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,110
fact that didn't one smell like a

202
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:09,659
hippies man

203
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,430
didn't want to be overly greasy and tap

204
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:13,049
tacky what were some of the other

205
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:15,299
factors that you were kind of shooting

206
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:17,039
for when the product well it's funny

207
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:19,799
that the product ended up having such

208
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,349
wide appeal in doing well because when I

209
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:25,438
designed it I had two people in mind

210
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:28,889
it's very specifically my grandma and my

211
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:30,899
dad and they had very specific issues

212
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:32,549
that I was trying to address like my

213
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,339
grandma is still caught up in that

214
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:37,588
belief that fat is bad and she's like

215
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,410
terrified of cholesterol and she takes

216
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:40,209
statin

217
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:43,059
which are just horrible for you and

218
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:46,388
nothing I do can I can convince her to

219
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:52,299
stop those destructive behaviors but I

220
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:54,818
knew that the emu oil which is one of

221
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:56,818
the ingredients in our topical I knew

222
00:10:54,818 --> 00:11:00,519
that it had the ability to mimic

223
00:10:56,818 --> 00:11:03,068
cholesterol and so when it hits the skin

224
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:05,889
and is absorbed it essentially takes the

225
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:08,110
place of missing cholesterol in handling

226
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:10,629
inflammatory issues in the localized

227
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,730
area where you're applying it which is

228
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:18,459
why emu oil by itself is

229
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:20,800
anti-inflammatory so that was that was

230
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:23,559
half the reason like I knew that the she

231
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:26,740
was fat phobic and I wanted to get some

232
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:27,789
good cholesterol fats into her any way

233
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,049
that I could

234
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:35,769
so essentially working around her own

235
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:37,838
particular ways of accessing health

236
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:39,039
which aren't really serving her and

237
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,110
since you can't get her to change

238
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,269
behavior you gave her a product that

239
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,709
worked around her behavior and that was

240
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,810
kind of you were part of your design

241
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,909
constraints and then the herbal

242
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:51,879
ingredients that ended up infusing into

243
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:54,219
that original batch of oil was just what

244
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,870
I happened to have growing in my herb

245
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,360
garden because I we were doing

246
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:01,299
permaculture cannabis cultivation at the

247
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,680
time at the time so I had calendula and

248
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:07,028
chamomile and a bunch of other stuff

249
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:10,299
coke planted and I harvested those

250
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:13,559
flowers you know what pinching off

251
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:16,169
little chamomile flowers every day

252
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:20,278
till I had a jar full of that a jar full

253
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:22,229
of calendula I I took some lemons off

254
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:25,708
the lemon tree and I peeled them and I

255
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:28,199
put those skins into the oil too which

256
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:30,149
so I did all this on instinct initially

257
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:32,549
and then come to find out well calendula

258
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:35,100
is incredibly good for healing and

259
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:39,859
restoring skin and fighting infections

260
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:42,689
and chamomile is one of the best

261
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,669
medicinal plants next to cannabis I

262
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:47,149
would put that like cannabis number one

263
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:50,998
chamomile number two like ginger third

264
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:52,799
and that's what I finished with I the

265
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:55,800
one ingredient I went out and actually

266
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:58,019
bought you know specifically to put into

267
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:05,698
this that I didn't have on hand was

268
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:08,339
ginger co2 extract which is hundreds and

269
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:12,179
hundreds of monoterpenes and sesqui

270
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:14,610
terpenes and phenols polyphenols all of

271
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:17,989
all the things that make the synergistic

272
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:21,839
effect in cannabis with the terpenes

273
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:23,938
most of those are found in ginger lower

274
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,360
amounts differing varying amounts

275
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:28,860
different combinations but that's that's

276
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,870
kind of one of the things that we really

277
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,329
like experimenting with also is finding

278
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,129
out the other plants that work within

279
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:37,799
the endocannabinoid system to help

280
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:40,188
modulate human human health and human

281
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:40,188
metabolism

282
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:45,699
we're researching every day we're trying

283
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,190
new things every day we're trying to

284
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,540
make sure that we you know get it ons

285
00:13:48,190 --> 00:14:05,489
people and get actual people using it

286
00:13:51,539 --> 00:14:05,488
