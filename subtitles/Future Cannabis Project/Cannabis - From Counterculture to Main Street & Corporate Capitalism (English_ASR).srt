[Music]

3
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:26,800
I'm David Bennett suck apparently a

4
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,300
professional stoner

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,269
I'd like to think of myself a bit more

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,350
as a journalist I've been covering

7
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:35,979
cannabis I am a STONER

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:39,890
I've been covering cannabis for 15 years

9
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:43,009
that's a big period of time for cannabis

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:46,340
a lot of change I now write a lot for

11
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:48,439
Leafly and I have a podcast called great

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:52,040
moments in weed history with Abdullah

13
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:55,488
and beam spoiler alert I'm being another

14
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,899
guy as Abdullah I'm very excited for the

15
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:59,979
panel I'm going to introduce everybody

16
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:03,770
in a second and then they can of course

17
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:07,179
educate and entertain us all the panel

18
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:09,978
as promised is called from

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,840
counterculture to Main Street but I'm

20
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:14,450
actually gonna rename it because I don't

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,020
think that's what we're facing I think

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:21,140
what we're facing is from counterculture

23
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:22,879
to corporate capitalism when I look at

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,329
what's going on with cannabis

25
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:29,598
I see the counterculture and Main Street

26
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:34,719
on one side we share a lot of the same

27
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:37,849
values and I see corporate cannabis as

28
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:41,569
this new entity and where things are

29
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:43,219
actually moving and I think that we all

30
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:47,390
have to be realistic about what that

31
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:49,789
means I like to say everything bad

32
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,429
that's been happening to small

33
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:54,500
businesses and small farmers in this

34
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:56,989
country over the last 50 years is

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,420
happening to cannabis all at once right

36
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:01,329
now is there anybody who doesn't know

37
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:05,359
what I mean by that

38
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:08,090
okay that's pretty powerful we all know

39
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,949
that that's what's happening I don't

40
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,400
even need to explain to you the market

41
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:15,049
forces that are at work but this is our

42
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,719
community and our movement and it

43
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:21,410
doesn't have to go that way

44
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:23,750
so I think that idea of that we're

45
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:26,959
moving to Main Street is not really

46
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,449
where we're moving we're moving to

47
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,640
corporate capitalism so let's be honest

48
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,229
about that and let's be honest about

49
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:35,839
Wall Street

50
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:38,268
and what their values are you know there

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,640
was a lot of talk as we approach

52
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:42,590
legalization tell me hands up if you've

53
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,000
heard this one Wall Street and big

54
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:48,650
business are going to legitimize

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,949
cannabis bullshit right anybody disagree

56
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,959
cannabis incredibly legitimate Wall

57
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:59,268
Street in big business not such a good

58
00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:03,560
record so what we have to ask ourselves

59
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:05,780
as these two forces meet cannabis and

60
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,560
free-market capitalism as its practiced

61
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:12,829
in the United States at least is it

62
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,098
going to add to our culture is it going

63
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:18,980
to add to the values of this plant or is

64
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:20,929
it going to be an extraction industry I

65
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:23,238
was just up in Humboldt County who knows

66
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,719
Humboldt County okay that's the heart

67
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,509
and soul the whole Emerald triangle

68
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,530
everybody but really the heart and soul

69
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:34,789
what are the industries that have been

70
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:37,189
there before timber and fishing their

71
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:38,689
extraction industries well guess what

72
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:40,219
they're not there anymore because they

73
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:42,680
took all the trees and they took all the

74
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:45,829
fish and what they left behind was poor

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,469
people poor people who turn to this

76
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:51,049
plant turn to cannabis and found a new

77
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:54,109
way of life well now we're facing

78
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:56,139
another extraction industry ok cannabis

79
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:59,689
is renewable you have to keep growing it

80
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:02,810
but what they're extracting is market

81
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:06,620
share what they're extracting is the

82
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:09,680
value of this plant only in terms of

83
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:14,359
money and we have to place that value

84
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,189
differently so my first let me introduce

85
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:18,500
the panel and I'll just say my first

86
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:21,680
question to them is going to be how do

87
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,750
we balance these things how do we make

88
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,668
sure that the roots culture of cannabis

89
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,370
that we all love and that sauce through

90
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:31,009
this prohibition survives and how do we

91
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,038
make sure that the communities that have

92
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:35,269
been targeted by this prohibition

93
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:37,579
disproportionately put in prison have

94
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:40,759
their families torn apart how do we open

95
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:45,288
a door for them and not just let all the

96
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:47,219
market share and all the capital flow to

97
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:49,259
people who frankly already

98
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,380
way too much money and way too much

99
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:54,839
power and not a good track record of

100
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:56,909
using it so that's gonna be my first

101
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,629
question but let me introduce everybody

102
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:03,030
and then they can weigh in

103
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:05,100

nearly everyone in the cannabis

119
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,389
community and his expertise includes

122
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,470
and and what I love about this panel is

123
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,379
it shows everyone coming from different

124
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,460
directions all have a place in this

125
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,560
community

126
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:57,899
Bret Leonard has been at the forefront

127
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,290
of the digital media revolution for over

128
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:02,759
25 years whether it be the director

129
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:07,340
writer of the groundbreaking cult

130
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:09,689
classic film lawnmower man yes whoo

131
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:12,239
which introduced the concept of virtual

132
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:14,819
reality of popular culture or being the

133
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,310
first to pioneer modern stereoscopic

134
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:23,399
techniques and photo risk realistic CGI

135
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:24,870
and his IMAX film t-rex Nicole West has

136
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,719
over 10 years of experience in the

137
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,668
cannabis industry and has had success in

138
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,850
forty five-plus cannabis business

139
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:35,459
applications open 20 retail locations in

140
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,439
four states overseeing over 200 million

141
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,449
dollars in sales and has helped scale

142
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:43,978
over a hundred and fifty thousand square

143
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:47,490
feet of cultivation and yeah that's a

144
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:50,719
lot and I'm sorry Rebecca is it Gascon

145
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:53,970
mm-hmm I should have just gone for it

146
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,250
Rebecca Gasca is a cannabis business and

147
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,760
government affairs strategist who's drug

148
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,689
policy experience began in 2008 as the

149
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,110
first in-house

150
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:06,479
lobbyists for the ACLU of Nevada and she

151
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,038
is the founder of pistol and stigma

152
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,860
which works to bridge the gap between

153
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,478
policymakers and the emerging cannabis

154
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,189
industry which is definitely something

155
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:19,468
we're going to get into but why don't we

156
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:21,899
start closest to me and we'll move down

157
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:26,158
the line a little bit just general

158
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:30,509
thoughts on as I say you know this

159
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:33,209
intersection between cannabis capitalism

160
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:35,908
what's to be gained what are the dangers

161
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:40,110
and how do we as a community respond to

162
00:07:35,908 --> 00:07:43,139
what can be an existential threat and as

163
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:47,879
we're seeing in the marketplace a huge

164
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:50,579
number of businesses not able to compete

165
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,369
on what's you know not really a fair or

166
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:55,528
playing field in many ways so yeah I

167
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:57,689
mean I've been connected to all this

168
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:59,999
ever since my film was rated as one of

169
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:02,579
the top ten stoner films of all time by

170
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,588
premier magazine a long time ago so I've

171
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:07,468
got some Leben connected to being a

172
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:09,838
STONER professional like you are in the

173
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:13,079
context of being a filmmaker and someone

174
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:15,329
who also is a cannabis enthusiast I will

175
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,399
tell you that the more weed I smoked on

176
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:20,158
the films I made the more successful

177
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,988
that film was and that literally is a

178
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:24,178
true statement

179
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:27,058
beyond that in context of your question

180
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:28,618
I feel there's a Platonic responsibility

181
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:31,829
for those of us that are global

182
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:34,949
storytellers to tell stories to shift

183
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:37,168
the narrative around cannabis culture to

184
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:39,299
make it much more inclusive and more

185
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:41,458
expanded outside of the ghettoization

186
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,408
that it has been given by most of how

187
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,369
they would content and most content in

188
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:45,899
general now there's nothing wrong with

189
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,209
stoner comedies there's actually a few

190
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,188
very funny ones and good ones but that

191
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,539
is not the entire story as a matter of

192
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:54,299
fact it's the tiniest sliver of the

193
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:58,198
story so at my company studio lightship

194
00:08:54,299 --> 00:09:01,229
we are very much embedding in many of

195
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:04,049
our IP our creative projects which by

196
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,600
the way in encompass what we call VX

197
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:09,419
story worlds virtual experience that's

198
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,629
what I call VX it's VR AR em are at

199
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:15,509
their core but are also feature films

200
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:18,120
digital content television content and

201
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:19,860
you know Arg and finally at the core

202
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,570
virtual story worlds in that as a

203
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,220
storyteller or now as I call myself

204
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:29,460
story world or we are embedding positive

205
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:32,340
truthful mythology around what this is

206
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,889
as a culture and that needs to lead the

207
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:37,530
way storytelling has always led the way

208
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:40,139
in terms of the steering of the

209
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:42,470
zeitgeist and right now there is as we

210
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:45,090
all know there has been a disinformation

211
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,730
narrative going on around cannabis

212
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:50,750
culture for a very long time and it's

213
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:53,970
been stepped up with the increasing

214
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,409
success of the new business models but

215
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,200
of course that's one of the things

216
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:59,819
that's creating the corporatization

217
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,160
because there's this this feeling like

218
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,440
you can't actually address the core soul

219
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,959
of what this is about which is health

220
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,550
healing and actually a mind medicine for

221
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,560
the planet that is unprecedented in

222
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:11,969
human history and that narrative in that

223
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,129
story is something I'm committed to

224
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,629
telling and I believe that that is one

225
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:18,000
of the first steps that has to happen

226
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:20,159
for popular adoption of really

227
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:32,370
understanding what is at the core of

228
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:36,509
cannabis thanks thank you so I I think

229
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:39,570
it's important to note that this isn't a

230
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:43,669
binary like it's not an us-versus-them

231
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:47,160
and I think that the longer that that

232
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:48,750
sort of framework is extended the more

233
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,549
of a disservice we're doing to ourselves

234
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,279
as advocates as people who care about

235
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:58,859
cannabis as business owners as you know

236
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:02,429
parents as scientists because you can't

237
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:05,730
look at this through my kata mist lens

238
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:07,799
as a lobbyist somebody who comes from

239
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,019
drug policy and criminal justice reform

240
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:13,649
who's a civil libertarian at heart like

241
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:15,600
I know that the only way that I was ever

242
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:18,360
able to move the ball down the court was

243
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,310
because I reached across aisles talking

244
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,830
to people even when they thought they

245
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:26,489
weren't going to agree with me right

246
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:29,129
that is how you change this story

247
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,159
right that is how you touch minds and

248
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:33,899
hearts and it takes everybody to do that

249
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:36,649
what's most interesting to me is since I

250
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,970
left and I started pistol and Sigma I

251
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:42,360
worked with people who have been

252
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,940
longtime growers right who were arguably

253
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,669
incredibly successful but they don't

254
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,030
know how to create rules to the game

255
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:53,849
right and that's what you can do when

256
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:55,559
you are proactive advocate and lobbyists

257
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,750
you rewrite the rules and that's what

258
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:00,779
we're doing in this industry thankfully

259
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,789
I had a very fortunate opportunity as a

260
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:05,329
lobbyist for the ACLU where I got

261
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:07,889
entrenched into the actual like

262
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:10,860
institutional side of rule writing right

263
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:15,539
policymaking where I got to see how easy

264
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,490
it actually was to be able to shift the

265
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:18,629
narrative once you were there and you

266
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,310
were applying yourself

267
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:23,009
I've been lucky that I've been able to

268
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:25,619
take that same experience and apply it

269
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:28,769
from state to state with clients now

270
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,929
across the United States and to be able

271
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:33,480
to take what has otherwise been you know

272
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:35,579
institutional capital and teach my

273
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,800
clients like okay you come from this

274
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,590
banking world you come from this

275
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,029
business world right that is very very

276
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,840
different than how the cannabis industry

277
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:48,419
has worked thus far but I can take your

278
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:52,410
capital and I can apply it in meaningful

279
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:55,409
ways to write some of those wrongs of

280
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:58,850
the you know of the criminalized aspects

281
00:12:55,409 --> 00:13:02,370
of the industry and teach people how to

282
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,930
otherwise you know participate on a

283
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,879
level that four on a social justice

284
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:07,319
level that they've never had the

285
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,169
opportunity before because they've been

286
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,740
working through this you know blinded

287
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:15,419
set of their own business functions but

288
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,980
now I get to pull them into the cannabis

289
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:20,039
industry and be like oh guess what you

290
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,740
get to work with people who care it's

291
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:25,110
awesome right but but it does take

292
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,720
reaching across the aisle it does take

293
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:30,659
saying okay you might have a different

294
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,149
history than I do but let's talk about

295
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,649
how we can co-create this now moving

296
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:39,669
forward and does it take a lot of money

297
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:41,949
yeah you know of course it's not easy to

298
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:44,620
build a business I learned that like you

299
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:47,500
know I'm a little guy still right like I

300
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,690
you know my firm has learned the hard

301
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,860
way like how to do business I come from

302
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:55,540
a nonprofit background right but

303
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,129
gracefully I am learning from my own

304
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:58,809
clients and I'm learning from the

305
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,789
engagements that I have you know from

306
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:02,319
state to state and it's but again I just

307
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:05,009
want to stress that this is not us

308
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,960
versus them we're all a part of this now

309
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:09,519
I want to just make a quick point I

310
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,990
think there's a big distinction to be

311
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,519
made between ending the war on cannabis

312
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,950
ending the arrests ending this

313
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,230
incredibly oppressive system that's

314
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:23,020
winning the war and now what we're

315
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,909
talking about is winning the peace which

316
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:27,399
is the economic aspect of it how many

317
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:31,209
people out here are small cannabis

318
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:34,120
business owners or small growers and how

319
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:40,090
many of you feel that the rules of the

320
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:43,200
game are fair I don't see anybody you

321
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:46,660
know that speaks kind of volumes to me

322
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,430
and I think that that's what we the

323
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:50,610
mentality we have to pat ourselves on

324
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:53,019
the back really hard for ending this

325
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:56,440
incredibly oppressive system but we have

326
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:58,539
to be realistic about what we're up

327
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,910
against and what I'm hearing is an

328
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:02,469
extinction-level event for these small

329
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:03,819
business owners and for these small

330
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,759
farmers and it doesn't mean bad

331
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:10,860
intentions it means we're taking a

332
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:13,569
system that existed outside of

333
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,909
mainstream capitalism and pushing it

334
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:19,260
into that system and we have to you know

335
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:21,879
be honest about what's what's going on

336
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:24,460
and I kind of wanted to parlay off of

337
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,080
both of them in my opinions and it's

338
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,450
because I have two different places that

339
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,030
I come from in this space ten years ago

340
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,110
I was one of the first lottery winners

341
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:33,629
in the city of Long Beach in this

342
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,250
beautiful city that we're all in

343
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:38,110
currently I am NOT a license holder in

344
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,159
the city of Long Beach I invested a

345
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,580
little over a quarter of a million

346
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:45,399
dollars we played two leases for almost

347
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,990
two years to go through the process I

348
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,340
got a location for those of you who are

349
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,779
familiar with the city of Long Beach I

350
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,190
was over off the Studebaker in spring

351
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,629
right across from the El Dorado disc

352
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,580
golf course

353
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:56,350
this upset some council members within

354
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,910
the city at the time they were able to

355
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,670
overturn the ordinance after they took

356
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:03,279
all of my money made me relocate and add

357
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:06,699
parks to the ordinance after the fact

358
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,769
thus zoning me out in the process of me

359
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,170
losing my entire life at the youngest

360
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:13,449
business owner in my family I felt

361
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:14,889
vindicated to fight right my first were

362
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,480
warriors in this fight

363
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:18,580
the answer is we I have to fight and

364
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,230
stand up against this so I fought I

365
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,120
fought for almost a year I had all my

366
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,550
friends and family that worked for me I

367
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,679
was receiving $1,000 a day fine to

368
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:28,750
myself and $1,000 fine day to my

369
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:30,159
landlord my landlord was pretty cool he

370
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,600
said keep paying the bills and I'll let

371
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,799
you stay as long as you want but at a

372
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,860
certain point when the police are

373
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,179
harassing your customers you decide to

374
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,500
shut down your business my customers

375
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:40,059
were getting tickets my employees were

376
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,639
getting their cars towed I mean it

377
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:45,399
became a full-on harassment from the

378
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,529
Long Beach PD I eventually decided I'm

379
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,870
gonna shut down but I had fought for too

380
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,970
long that process of fighting for so

381
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,679
long in in this new ordinance when the

382
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,360
city of Long Beach got all those people

383
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,669
that were able to get priority points

384
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,000
because I fought for what we stood up

385
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:02,889
for I lost my ability to apply for a

386
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,140
priority license when Long Beach did

387
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:07,328
their licensing process last year so I

388
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,160
was required to go into the priority 3

389
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:11,379
section even though they had taken my

390
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,910
entire life from me and I when I say my

391
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,980
entire life I literally mean my entire

392
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,459
life from all of the money I had to my

393
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,809
car fast forward 10 years that I've I

394
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:21,959
moved to Colorado because obviously

395
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:24,309
California wasn't ready at the time I

396
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,799
worked for a bunch of companies Mike I'm

397
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:29,319
now back I just started a marketing and

398
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:32,980
branding company but I do also I do

399
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:35,529
advisement for investment firms and my

400
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:38,170
main piece of that is from the cannabis

401
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:39,910
industry I try to claim myself as a

402
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,560
fairy godmother of cannabis because I

403
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,210
want the people who are coming into this

404
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,859
looking for money to know what the heck

405
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,200
they're asking for to know what they're

406
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:49,359
signing up for and so for me and for any

407
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,340
of you out there who have that bit of

408
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,199
knowledge who have the ability to impart

409
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:55,240
this information to your friends you owe

410
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,069
it to them you owe it to them so that

411
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,779
they can make wise money decisions

412
00:17:57,069 --> 00:18:01,539
because so many of us have been living

413
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:03,160
in shoeboxes of cash having no interest

414
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,259
didn't even be able to talk to a bank so

415
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,810
the people who are most experienced in

416
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:08,660
this business

417
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:10,129
I have no financial understanding of

418
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,140
what it even means to look at a banker

419
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,520
and say here's my money they don't even

420
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,530
they get nervous when they walk into the

421
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,029
bank to cash or personal check I mean

422
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,379
and that's the truth and and a lot of

423
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,339
these people are still coming out of

424
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,140
their ptsds

425
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:24,439
so if you're one of those people who is

426
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:26,060
coming from the other side some of my

427
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,440
best mentors right now are people that

428
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:28,759
have no and your interaction with

429
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,500
cannabis outside of the fact that they

430
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:32,420
believe in it and they're coming in from

431
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,950
banking they're coming in from finance

432
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,560
and I'm connecting with these people

433
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,059
that understand that this is a movement

434
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,809
and that people whose lives are being

435
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:43,970
changed by this and so for me I say if

436
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:46,220
you have the ability to impart knowledge

437
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,019
to one of your farmer friends or or

438
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,730
extract your friends who's been crushing

439
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:52,069
it what they're doing but maybe have not

440
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,180
been able to use a bank or ever ask for

441
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:55,099
money I mean if you've been in the

442
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,930
industry for more than five years you've

443
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:58,429
never even considered going to a bank to

444
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:01,279
be like hey can I have a million dollars

445
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,900
get out of here and so that reality

446
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,970
we've never even read a book most of the

447
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,490
people to understand what what most of

448
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,900
these terms mean I was at the Boston

449
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,640
freedom rally I told people there's a

450
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,019
book called investment terms for dummies

451
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,270
and I know it seems silly but read it

452
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:16,639
before you go talk to some money people

453
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:18,740
and something as simple as that we need

454
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,570
to educate ourselves and for those of us

455
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,059
who are already educated who are making

456
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:24,829
the way it's your duty to help those

457
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:26,929
people that you know deserve to have a

458
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:29,419
space in this industry to fight for that

459
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:31,610
and to educate your people yeah

460
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:34,400
absolutely let's just just for anybody

461
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:37,729
who's not aware of due to cannabis being

462
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,670
federally illegal that prevents not just

463
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:43,039
banking but getting a bank loan so

464
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:46,070
you've had a successful business for ten

465
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,190
years your books are great to the extent

466
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:50,990
that you know you could show them but

467
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,240
you're denied the money to grow your

468
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:56,180
business to compete and yet somebody

469
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,400
with private equity can come in with a

470
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:02,990
hundred times your money they can make

471
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,960
fifteen fuck-ups and still win where you

472
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,549
get one chance and then all too often

473
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,170
they turn around and say well these

474
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:12,619
stoners just don't know how to run a

475
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:14,360
business and you know I think what

476
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:16,939
you're saying is there are people of

477
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:18,139
good intention coming in with the values

478
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,779
of the plant and we

479
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,880
want them but the question is are you

480
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:27,649
gonna add something or are you just

481
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:31,100
going to extract you know how many

482
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:35,030
people had any trouble getting cannabis

483
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:37,039
in California ten years ago we know how

484
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:40,099
to grow and distribute cannabis

485
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,109
we don't need private equity to do it so

486
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:45,619
let's take that off so what are you

487
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:48,319
gonna add Justin I want to thank you for

488
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:50,059
this topic anybody who knows me knows

489
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,639
this is pretty much all I talk about all

490
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:56,059
day long like everyday this is it as you

491
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,680
know I won't drop an expletive there but

492
00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:02,720
capitalism before that fuck is the word

493
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,840
he's thank you very much fuck capitalism

494
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,240
no last year I said I write is relative

495
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:11,329
in you know capitalism is messed up at

496
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,559
best and I dealt with hezekiah said like

497
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:14,299
oh my god I can't believe you said that

498
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,980
on stage and now we're having a full-on

499
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:18,200
discussion so this is the evolution of

500
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:21,789
the conversation we're finally tired of

501
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:25,250
it it's not an us-versus-them it's an it

502
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:29,480
capitalism is an it it is a disease it

503
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:31,970
is it creates disease like we I don't

504
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,150
feel easy I don't go to bed easy I don't

505
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:37,460
wake up easy I have to tell my children

506
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,620
they can and can't do things that we

507
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:43,100
could and couldn't do before and like

508
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:45,439
you know and why you know it's like you

509
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:48,740
know I moved into a beautiful region to

510
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,039
raise my family the right way and I'm

511
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,200
watching people who've never touched

512
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:57,170
cannabis before taking market share

513
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,080
dropping us down 2/3 making things it's

514
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,490
the REE criminalization of cannabis it's

515
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,220
not decriminalization is not

516
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:07,220
legalization we got recriminate

517
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,569
into a separate category and now you

518
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,410
know they're like thank you we'll take

519
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:13,490
it from here

520
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:15,470
good capitalist this is this is our

521
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,120
chance while we're still having this

522
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,519
conversation hopefully this conversation

523
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:22,909
continues to actually take the main

524
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,379
stage that we have and speak out against

525
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:27,170
what we're doing to the rest of the

526
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,450
world we are shipping capitalism around

527
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:30,650
the whole planet and we're getting to

528
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,970
see it now we're actually getting to

529
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,100
experience at a small

530
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,589
scale producers they can tell this story

531
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:39,799
we can tell the story of how you know

532
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:40,939
yesterday I could buy groceries next

533
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:42,829
week I'm probably gonna be on food

534
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,529
stamps week afterward I'm probably gonna

535
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:47,869
be working for someone and that and and

536
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:50,359
then keep on and keep on and keep on

537
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:51,979
losing farms my friends my neighbors

538
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:53,449
everyone that I turned to has a

539
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,450
different story I've become a grief

540
00:22:53,450 --> 00:23:03,259
counselor on my Ridge I'm not even an

541
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:05,420
activist anymore the idea that we as you

542
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:09,079
know we as small-scale producers have a

543
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:11,539
chance is is like sort of like a it's

544
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:14,689
like a myth and a hero's journey right

545
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:16,879
like it's like it's the only thing now

546
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:20,180
that we can do the show the world that

547
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,820
like there's a breath left and humanity

548
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:25,910
I mean the idea that we are actually

549
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:28,189
seeing people like come in well funded

550
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,830
with 20 million dollars to buy a shelf

551
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,200
space to push small producers off the

552
00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:35,089
market like and we're what and we're

553
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,980
applauding these people we're cooking

554
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:38,779
them dinners we're throwing events for

555
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,660
them we're letting them sponsor it's

556
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:45,710
it's it's it's beyond ridiculous it's

557
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:47,600
like and then now we're funding water

558
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,640
infrastructure being stolen from

559
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,759
Northern California shipped down to the

560
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,140
desert to build billions of dollars of

561
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:55,789
infrastructure to build a new

562
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,940
agricultural industry where there was

563
00:23:55,789 --> 00:24:01,670
none that's capitalism I mean so like I

564
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,650
don't like I could talk for like days

565
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:08,029
and days and days it's probably like two

566
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:12,470
zero point and no end because I think at

567
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:16,190
the end of the day like as depressed as

568
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:18,140
I get it's like I'm also just as hopeful

569
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,660
and happy that we're having this

570
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,840
conversation I'm hopeful and happy that

571
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:26,269
we can decentralize agriculture I'm so

572
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,549
happy we're having a collective and

573
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:31,609
cooperative conversation about how to

574
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:33,919
distribute resources I think that if I

575
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:38,179
was to say something about the Segway is

576
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:40,850
it like work together don't sell out you

577
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:43,759
know every single one of us like band

578
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:45,469
together sign jayvees you know create

579
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,919
cooperatives

580
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,839
you know don't sell to Canadian

581
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:52,970
companies just because they're offering

582
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,789
you hella money you know what I'm saying

583
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:57,710
like you know give that IP to your

584
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:59,869
neighbor you know and your neighbors

585
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,910
neighbor and continue that pattern

586
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:07,759
forward so I'm just gonna keep on

587
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:10,340
talking about it again one more quick

588
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:13,419
show of hands who here in their hearts

589
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:18,319
loves coal more than they love cannabis

590
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:19,820
again nobody but and this is with full

591
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,399
respect to people who work in that

592
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:25,339
industry when we hear oh my god we're

593
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,970
gonna lose coal jobs even though we know

594
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:31,519
that industry is polluting the planet

595
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,900
potentially into a catastrophe we

596
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,970
collectively act like it's the biggest

597
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,860
emergency that ever fucking happened on

598
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,980
planet earth is we have to save these

599
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:43,308
coal jobs well we have 60,000 small

600
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:46,640
cannabis farmers in this state alone and

601
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:51,859
they're facing that and we need to react

602
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:55,009
I would say even more robustly and you

603
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:58,699
know chuckle all right good man yeah

604
00:25:55,009 --> 00:26:02,150
fuck coal totally no but it is kind of a

605
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,548
terrible polluting so here's what I

606
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,830
would say I love the Joseph Campbell

607
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:10,400
hero's journey reference I think that's

608
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:11,720
fantastic I think everyone here is here

609
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,269
because they're on their own hero's

610
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,000
journey and I think part of this whole

611
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:19,548
thing part of this legalization thing

612
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,500
that's happening is we're bringing

613
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:25,879
together the people who thought we were

614
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,650
15 years ago when I was at high times

615
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,410
and I told people I was at high times

616
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:32,720
they would be like that is fucking

617
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:35,330
disgusting you dirty stoner and now

618
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,730
they're like hey can I pick your brain

619
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:39,319
about CBD do you know anything about

620
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,210
this weed business what about these

621
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:42,710
Canadian stocks is there anything going

622
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,819
on that I should know about like is this

623
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,360
the craziest thing that's ever happened

624
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:49,069
and while there is a lot of negativity

625
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,490
around it there's also a lot of

626
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:55,069
positivity because we have a moment now

627
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:56,210
and mean I love you but I don't think

628
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:57,558
the war is over

629
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,149
I don't think we're fighting for the

630
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:01,788
peace yet I still think we're

631
00:26:59,148 --> 00:27:04,518
fighting the war and I am very very

632
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:06,798
strongly that we have not won that

633
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,868
there's still large compartes of this

634
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,179
country that are not the people are

635
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:15,408
still going to jail like I went to jail

636
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:17,899
and people are going to jail and I sat

637
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:20,119
in jail for five days with the federal

638
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:22,758
government and it fucking sucks

639
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:25,009
and if any of you have done that it's

640
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:28,999
the worst thing in the entire fucking

641
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:31,639
world so anything that you can do to get

642
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:34,368
yourself out of that situation to stop

643
00:27:31,638 --> 00:27:38,118
the people from arresting us for

644
00:27:34,368 --> 00:27:39,079
cannabis I am supportive of I don't like

645
00:27:38,118 --> 00:27:41,898
John Boehner

646
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:44,239
I think he was a fucking asshole but the

647
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:46,968
fact that he's on Kevin's board now is a

648
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:49,009
huge movement the fact that Mitch

649
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:51,229
McConnell signed off on the farm bill

650
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:52,519
because a couple people I know went in

651
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:55,399
and lobbied the fuck out of him for

652
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:58,759
their farms and Kentucky that's huge

653
00:27:55,398 --> 00:28:00,699
like all of this aside people should not

654
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:03,378
be going to jail for a fucking plant

655
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,769
everybody in here I hope everybody in

656
00:28:03,378 --> 00:28:07,939
here agrees with that so like we gotta

657
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:10,579
win the war

658
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,919
first before we win the peace and that

659
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:16,308
really does involve money because this

660
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:19,099
country it's a fucked up system but it's

661
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:21,048
our system and that's yes everyone here

662
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:23,479
should be agitating to change the system

663
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:25,338
but we also have to change the fact that

664
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:28,009
we're going to fucking jail for weed and

665
00:28:25,338 --> 00:28:29,538
that there's eight great states that

666
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:30,950
have legalized it but there's still

667
00:28:29,538 --> 00:28:32,929
people going to jail there's people

668
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,598
getting hit in NorCal I know someone who

669
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:37,009
went to jail three weeks ago they might

670
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:40,608
have been shipping weed summer I don't

671
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:42,469
know okay maybe they're okay sure sure

672
00:28:40,608 --> 00:28:45,918
okay yeah

673
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:48,379
but fuck that like they're still going

674
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,399
to jail here in California what is it

675
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:53,778
require it requires all of these

676
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:55,158
wonderful people in Congress who you

677
00:28:53,778 --> 00:28:57,588
maybe would never want to share a

678
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:00,109
fucking joint with but you definitely

679
00:28:57,588 --> 00:29:02,088
want them to vote on our side we need

680
00:29:00,108 --> 00:29:04,368
the states bill to pay we need all of

681
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:07,308
these fucking bills to pass so that

682
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:09,648
people stop going to jail and that's my

683
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:11,808
position the same one that we hadn't man

684
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:12,558
being worked together for many years we

685
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,970
had this conversation

686
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:17,058
many times smoking joints playing

687
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:20,120
ping-pong and you have to you have to

688
00:29:17,058 --> 00:29:22,460
win the war first like I idealism is

689
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:24,528
amazing and it's great but I don't want

690
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:28,278
anyone to ever go to jail again for weed

691
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:30,638
and that requires some money and some

692
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:33,940
people with their power to be like hey

693
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:37,339
guy who works with me on these projects

694
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:39,590
vote differently because I gave you X

695
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:41,298
dollars for your last campaign and

696
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:43,759
that's the shitty system that we're in

697
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:46,700
but if the system are in and we need to

698
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:49,548
fucking win this war we can fight about

699
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:52,129
how to make it better but right now it

700
00:29:49,548 --> 00:29:53,690
is still there is still hundreds of

701
00:29:52,128 --> 00:29:56,199
thousands of people going to jail

702
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,850
every year for smoking cannabis for

703
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,190
distributing cannabis for for bringing

704
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:03,859
cannabis somewhere for for whatever the

705
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:06,019
whatever the plant does they're like you

706
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:08,148
are now in jail you are stripped of your

707
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:09,980
freedom your rights your voting rights

708
00:30:08,148 --> 00:30:12,678
you're no longer a human being and

709
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,259
that's fucking horrible and if we don't

710
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:18,200
stop that if we don't first of all stop

711
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:20,808
that and then get into the yes we need

712
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,909
to change the rest of the system yes you

713
00:30:20,808 --> 00:30:24,859
shouldn't be killing small farms to go

714
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:27,259
and build a fucking private equity thing

715
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:29,479
in the desert that shit is I'm sorry to

716
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:32,240
any of you who are running a giant

717
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:36,110
facility in the desert so no no insult

718
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,460
ment but like what the fuck like 400,000

719
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:39,199
square feet in the desert with no water

720
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,600
and you're like I'm gonna grow tons of

721
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,100
weed why why are you not going up to a

722
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,469
place where it's wet all the time and

723
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:46,819
perfect and just just work with the

724
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,470
people who have their setups there and

725
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:50,388
help them get licensed and give them

726
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,210
some money and then make money off of

727
00:30:50,388 --> 00:30:55,878
that rather than some absurd gleaming

728
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,499
desert dream anyway I'm sorry I grabbed

729
00:30:55,878 --> 00:31:00,769
the mic I'm I just feel very

730
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:03,860
passionately that if we don't fight for

731
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:06,079
the end of the war on drugs we can't

732
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:07,878
fight for the peace and it's not done

733
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,038
people are like people like oh it's done

734
00:31:07,878 --> 00:31:13,189
don't worry I'm like he can with a

735
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:16,368
stroke of the pen Donald Trump could

736
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:19,820
fucking arrest all of us every one of us

737
00:31:16,368 --> 00:31:22,308
just like that and it's still not done

738
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:24,798
so like we need to finish that off and

739
00:31:22,308 --> 00:31:26,269
then we can all deal with the remnants

740
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:29,168
but like first don't

741
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:32,509
go to jail okay I think I just

742
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:35,509
absolutely don't go to jail and don't

743
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:38,469
get caught the first responsibility of

744
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:40,969
any revolutionary is not to get caught

745
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:44,509
they can't arrest you if you don't get

746
00:31:40,969 --> 00:31:46,940
caught I I think I hope it's pretty

747
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:50,329
obvious that you know I've dedicated my

748
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:52,308
professional career to that idea that we

749
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:54,708
need to end this war on people

750
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:59,658
ultimately on marginalized people

751
00:31:54,709 --> 00:32:02,239
specifically I just don't think that the

752
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:04,309
two ideas are mutually exclusive the

753
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:08,209
idea that we work to end this oppressive

754
00:32:04,308 --> 00:32:11,538
system but that we don't give over our

755
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:15,619
values in our community to these moneyed

756
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:20,598
interests along the way I don't think

757
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:22,519
there's ever a right time to do that and

758
00:32:20,598 --> 00:32:24,828
I don't think there's ever a wrong time

759
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:28,159
to stand up for what you value and what

760
00:32:24,828 --> 00:32:30,469
you believe in and it's like to me

761
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,879
that's a false choice we don't have to

762
00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:34,009
put all these farmers out of business

763
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:37,158
and we don't have to put all these

764
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:39,019
mom-and-pop true believer people who put

765
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,899
their asses on the line and many of whom

766
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:44,598
went to prison we don't have to push

767
00:32:41,898 --> 00:32:47,868
them out into the street and push them

768
00:32:44,598 --> 00:32:51,678
back into the black market in order to

769
00:32:47,868 --> 00:32:53,749
win neither political party backed us

770
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,489
and we still won we took on the criminal

771
00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:57,919
justice system we took on the medical

772
00:32:55,489 --> 00:33:01,088
establishment we took on both political

773
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,429
parties we took on the public and

774
00:33:01,088 --> 00:33:07,969
propaganda and we won and we did it and

775
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:10,339
the politicians came along for the ride

776
00:33:07,969 --> 00:33:13,338
once we proved that this was a winning

777
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:19,368
issue they didn't lead and it wasn't a

778
00:33:13,338 --> 00:33:21,499
bribe it was us that changed and ended

779
00:33:19,368 --> 00:33:23,928
this and it's like if we give over to

780
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:27,618
the idea that it was some outside

781
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:31,038
benevolent force that did it we lose our

782
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:35,058
agency and we lose our sense of

783
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:37,878
community and we become sharecroppers to

784
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:38,750
corporate America and that's not my

785
00:33:37,878 --> 00:33:40,849
vision and

786
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:43,819
I think there's no wrong time to start

787
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:48,679
pushing back against that which gets to

788
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:50,599
my next question for the panel if we

789
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,210
really can't look at big business to

790
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:56,119
change outside of its own best interests

791
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:59,269
the economic fight is on very difficult

792
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:01,849
terrain but the culture fight is one

793
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:03,319
that we can win so how do we and Bret

794
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:07,069
this is a great question to start with

795
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:10,329
you how do we educate consumers who will

796
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:13,190
ultimately vote with their dollars to

797
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:15,559
support the kind of businesses and the

798
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:18,440
kind of business practices that make

799
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:21,168
this such an amazing and valuable

800
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:24,079
community well you've got to entertain

801
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:27,319
people in our culture you can't just

802
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:30,079
call it education it can't just be set

803
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,970
in this sort of dry situation it has to

804
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,750
be something that is done in a way that

805
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:37,908
moves emotion on a mass scale and that

806
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,530
is that's what's in coming upon

807
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,628
storytellers to tell better more

808
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:45,019
powerful stories and I believe as

809
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:48,230
Rebecca said the the core thing here is

810
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:50,989
to not polarize the bit the greater

811
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,730
narrative that this all fits into is the

812
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:55,339
greater narrative we're all experiencing

813
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:58,039
in American culture and many ways global

814
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,650
culture right now writ large this is a

815
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:03,199
time of separation and dividing and and

816
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:06,289
pitting things against each other as

817
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:07,939
long as we push against that with our

818
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:11,360
stories and push against it in a way

819
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:13,940
that creates the war and it is a war I

820
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,789
totally agree we haven't won the war

821
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,200
as long as we as push against that that

822
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:20,570
way we're going to get that same

823
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:23,179
resistance back sometimes even more

824
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:27,880
powerful and so we have to find a clever

825
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:30,619
way of shifting the overall mass

826
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,289
perception and that is not playing to

827
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:35,089
our own room it's not ghettoizing it to

828
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:37,099
be something that is just for this you

829
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,930
know those of us that know and there's

830
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:41,809
the smart stoners I mean there's so many

831
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:43,940
ways that elitism creeps into every

832
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:46,279
group into every fight into every

833
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:48,889
revolution and that can't happen here

834
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:52,040
because the truth is the core and soul

835
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:52,819
of this plant is for everyone it's

836
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:56,269
something that

837
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:58,220
creates so many ways of making your life

838
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:59,690
better you know and that's not just

839
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:02,419
about getting stone that's one tiny

840
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:06,470
little aspect of it so that larger story

841
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:09,019
and the the ability to shift it from the

842
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:10,699
polarization that's the challenge I

843
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:13,280
think that's where the answer lies to

844
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:14,989
start moving the body politic and the

845
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:21,320
group you know zeitgeist in the right

846
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:24,309
direction I would agree that this is

847
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:27,650
this is a global phenomena right this

848
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:31,759
stupid war on drugs has really divided

849
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:35,119
us in ways that are so beyond

850
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,310
unfortunate but it's not just California

851
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,809
right I mean obviously look at things

852
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:40,099
from the state state level but look at

853
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:43,429
things from a country to country level

854
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:45,319
right the US has been throwing its

855
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:49,669
weight around for far too long

856
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:52,190
in criminalizing consumption on a global

857
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:55,309
scale of one of the most powerfully

858
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,990
medicinal plants that again that we know

859
00:36:55,309 --> 00:37:00,049
of and I mean that's just one upright

860
00:36:56,989 --> 00:37:03,949
coca then you can go on to other

861
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:07,460
psychedelics plants are powerful and

862
00:37:03,949 --> 00:37:09,980
that was realized that was a you know

863
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:12,920
the the core of this more on drugs

864
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:16,309
heaven forbid you know people get along

865
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,110
shit you know cuz then the

866
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:19,670
military-industrial complex yeah I could

867
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:22,970
I could go on on that forever and ever

868
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:28,340
to but but really I really think this

869
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:30,139
comes down to popularizing some stories

870
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,730
right I mean that this is what happened

871
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:34,400
this is what we saw with Charlotte's Web

872
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:37,789
right Sanjay Gupta weeds all of that

873
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,750
like you move emotions you move people

874
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:44,269
you get people to start seeing like oh

875
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:47,210
you know this is like a like gay

876
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:49,400
marriage right gay marriage oh my gosh I

877
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,990
actually have a cousin who's gay so all

878
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,309
of a sudden it's not that terrible oh

879
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:58,369
you know my mom's her like retirement

880
00:37:55,309 --> 00:38:01,009
community ladies are like we want to

881
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:04,009
know what this CBD is right we heard

882
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:05,560
this could help so you take those

883
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:07,840
opportunities and

884
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:10,480
you start educating people where they're

885
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:14,470
at and that's been the problem I think

886
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:17,320
for so long in this work that we've done

887
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:20,230
it's been disparate disparate messaging

888
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,410
right because we're not starting where

889
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:26,110
other people are coming from you know

890
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:28,239
some people excuse me did some assholes

891
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:30,340
don't care that black and brown people

892
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,289
have been going to jail they still don't

893
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:34,269
and you know what we might never

894
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:36,119
convince them otherwise that that is

895
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:39,309
actually a real fucking problem

896
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:42,250
so we start to educate them where

897
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:45,880
they're at with Grandma right with their

898
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:47,739
grandchildren who have autism you know

899
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,260
you start looking at it from different

900
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:52,679
angles because this cannabis plant is

901
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:55,960
actually a dodecahedron right it is

902
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:58,659
immensely powerful and it can touch

903
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,519
everybody and I truly believe either

904
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:02,559
Knossos theory of the endocannabinoid

905
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:05,250
deficiency I think that we have been

906
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:07,690
living for way too long with not enough

907
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:09,940
cannabis to treat our endocannabinoids

908
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,309
system so you know I know that's like a

909
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,800
heady idea for most people but it's

910
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:16,719
natural food let my food be thy medicine

911
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,940
you know there are a lot of different

912
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,279
ways essentially to story-tell this and

913
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,980
and we're all responsible in different

914
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,870
ways for and to make it more successful

915
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,789
commercially in this form because we are

916
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:29,829
in this system we're in we are in a

917
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:32,230
capitalist society we can't but deny

918
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:34,779
that that's real I mean every business

919
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:36,969
that gets to this point of you know

920
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,620
these inflection points suddenly the

921
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:40,629
giant money comes in and that those

922
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:42,549
players come in on every single vertical

923
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,110
you can imagine so this is not a new

924
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,300
story that's why it's really a much

925
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:48,940
larger thing that I think this is

926
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:51,850
perfectly emblematic of and we can make

927
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:53,230
it the emblem of smaller is better think

928
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:54,759
I mean it literally will connect

929
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:58,269
directly to better healing better

930
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,430
lifestyle better wellness better joy

931
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:02,349
when we can tell that story and make

932
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:06,009
people understand it then this thing

933
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:07,869
moves Nicole so yet again my answers

934
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,850
kind of a combination of both of them

935
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:13,269
the entertainment factor is huge my

936
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:14,679
example on that as my grandmother I told

937
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:15,880
my grandma was a day trader for the

938
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,619
first five years of being in this

939
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,329
business I told her I sold commodities

940
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:22,659
which to this day I still believe is

941
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:24,519
pretty much the truth but in the process

942
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:26,319
my grandma found out it was the end of

943
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:28,059
the world I was a drug dealer

944
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,710
I was destroying my grandfather's life

945
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:31,900
because he was dying and I was sneaking

946
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:34,179
him edibles so that he could live the

947
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,559
end of his life in a good way I was

948
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:36,699
gonna destroy my grandfather's life who

949
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,929
was in a wheelchair and he was gonna

950
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:39,069
wheel himself out on the Long Beach

951
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:42,099
Boulevard looking for some crack or

952
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:45,280
something I mean I was I was the devil

953
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:46,839
and and since the education factor you

954
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,340
know I could have done the most I tried

955
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,410
to tell my grandma I had booklets and I

956
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:53,140
had information but the entertainment

957
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:55,269
piece got my grandma she watched a few

958
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:57,639
of those it really changed her in a big

959
00:40:55,269 --> 00:41:00,159
way and then the next piece of getting

960
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:01,779
to people where they are I agree and yes

961
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,159
like my educating my grandma was huge

962
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,830
she's that she's person that shows up in

963
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:08,739
votes every single time but local

964
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:11,019
government people forget how easy it is

965
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:12,759
to become a city council member I know

966
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:14,530
that not to say like it's the easiest

967
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,330
thing in the world but it's it's not

968
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,530
like becoming president like you can

969
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:19,449
make a difference in your local

970
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:21,400
community and even if you're not going

971
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:23,049
to become a city council member to get

972
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,630
to those people where they are because

973
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:27,430
most people who go into politics want to

974
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,720
continue in politics right like nobody

975
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:30,039
starts as a mayor and it's like yeah

976
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,899
this is it I'm done

977
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:33,940
most mayor's want to go on in the

978
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,230
Congress or something higher and so we

979
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,670
start on a level where they're actually

980
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,769
listening to us and they kind of still

981
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:40,360
have to listen to us that's just a

982
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:42,579
person that shows up to City Council and

983
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,900
waits for your three minutes you get to

984
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:45,819
speak to them where they are and if we

985
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,849
can start at an early stage in their

986
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:51,130
political development and help educate

987
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:53,110
people politically early on before they

988
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:56,380
become your president

989
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:57,849
sidenote on that but no but before they

990
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,590
become you know a governor or a

991
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:02,259
congressman or somebody who has

992
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:03,519
political experience that before that

993
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:06,340
happens if we could get to them where

994
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:08,469
they are as a city council member or as

995
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,000
a mayor I mean Mayor Robert Garcia was

996
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:11,859
here this morning like if you had it you

997
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,880
had a chance to speak with him when I

998
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,710
was going through the city of Long Beach

999
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,050
drama he was a council member I've been

1000
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:20,260
in his office he's heard my issues we've

1001
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:22,510
had one-on-one meetings and not to say

1002
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:25,210
that I changed his mind but all of us

1003
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:27,670
helped him understand where now you have

1004
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:29,949
a mayor who supports this that and

1005
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,780
that's huge we all got to somebody where

1006
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:32,750
he was and was able to really help

1007
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,370
educate

1008
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,840
a council member who then went on to be

1009
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:37,250
mayor who's now much more powerful and

1010
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,390
is allowing for things to happen that I

1011
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:41,179
don't know would have happened without

1012
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:42,739
Mayor Robert Garcia and so it's kind of

1013
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:44,869
combination the entertainment gets the

1014
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:46,939
voters to listen the voting age is in a

1015
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:49,929
big way and talking to people where they

1016
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:52,190
are we can bring people into politics

1017
00:42:49,929 --> 00:42:53,539
knowing about how amazing cannabis is

1018
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,789
rather than trying to convince somebody

1019
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:57,529
who's been doing their job for 30 years

1020
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:59,210
and has already kind of put the cloak

1021
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:01,010
over their eyes that this is a you know

1022
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,300
a drug and you know a lot of these

1023
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,670
people still really do believe that

1024
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,380
there's a war on cannabis out there and

1025
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:08,900
they need a fight against us because

1026
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:11,420
yeah the worst not over this is still

1027
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:14,420
very real but I would say entertain and

1028
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:16,400
talk to your local teams your local

1029
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,889
governments I mean especially when we

1030
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,530
talked about the equity that's locally

1031
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:23,839
being done because local governments did

1032
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:25,370
realize that this is a problem that the

1033
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,710
people have been going to jail for this

1034
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:29,690
by being racially profiled that's a huge

1035
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,159
issue and local government the state

1036
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,630
understands that it's a thing but local

1037
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:34,190
governments are choosing to enact their

1038
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,510
equity programs and that's because

1039
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,610
somebody talked to their local

1040
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:40,040
governments this has to happen and they

1041
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:42,349
want to make change I am really excited

1042
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:43,460
to hear Kath speak by the way because

1043
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:44,779
that's somebody that is really

1044
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,940
interesting right now if you guys aren't

1045
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,680
familiar with Kath Packer but following

1046
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,760
the the equity movement in LA has been

1047
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:52,359
really really interesting and I'm proud

1048
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,770
of what's happening right now thanks

1049
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,660
Justin I think that the Appalachian

1050
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:59,030
program that you could speak on is one

1051
00:43:56,659 --> 00:44:02,509
of the great things to come out of prop

1052
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:04,519
64 to help us educate these consumers

1053
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:06,730
right this is rapidly becoming my

1054
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:08,889
favorite panel ever we've got a

1055
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:12,050
moderator it allows us to drop f-bombs

1056
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:13,819
we have a capitalist bashing session and

1057
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:19,490
one of your panelists just dropped

1058
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:22,010
dodecahedron on the stage all right so

1059
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:24,109
yeah so basically I'm kind of cheating

1060
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:28,760
here because I live in a region that is

1061
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:32,110
steeped in heritage we are a legacy of

1062
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,430
small farmers every day is a story

1063
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:37,099
everything that we do is a story

1064
00:44:34,429 --> 00:44:39,169
everything is a story that replicates

1065
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:43,699
what's been going on for almost five

1066
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:45,900
decades in that region so you know the

1067
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:47,849
edutainment or however

1068
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,410
you know we want to call it where we're

1069
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:52,440
actually like educating people while

1070
00:44:49,409 --> 00:44:53,699
having fun is what we're about because

1071
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,340
in Northern California that's what we

1072
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:59,639
want to do is we we came up there to

1073
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:03,440
basically become small farmers raise our

1074
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:06,539
families a certain way and have fun in

1075
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,349
2015 in developing the Mendocino

1076
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:13,529
Appalachians project realizing that you

1077
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:16,069
know sort of resource mapping community

1078
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:18,960
resource mapping economic development

1079
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:21,059
seeing that no one in their right mind

1080
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,800
would stick a commodities grow

1081
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:25,349
two-and-a-half hours on the back side of

1082
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,900
a mountain down a windy road where two

1083
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:29,730
cars going down at the same time passing

1084
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,160
each other almost created off of a cliff

1085
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:36,179
makes absolutely no sense to a

1086
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:39,329
commodities distributor all we have in

1087
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:41,639
that region is tourism and all we have

1088
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:45,059
is our story and all we have is our

1089
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:47,279
quality and to tell the story of the

1090
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:49,199
breeding to tell the story of the

1091
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,720
communities to tell the story of the

1092
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:55,259
heritage in that region is is not only

1093
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:57,929
our right is not only our saving grace

1094
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,060
but it's also our gift to the rest of

1095
00:45:57,929 --> 00:46:02,399
the world because now we are creating a

1096
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:05,789
system is everyone here familiar with

1097
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,889
appellations of origin okay so similar

1098
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:12,389
to wine in France essentially like

1099
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:14,219
Bordeaux champagne in Northern

1100
00:46:12,389 --> 00:46:16,739
California in Mendocino we developed a

1101
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:19,319
map that's very similar to these regions

1102
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:20,819
so we've broken our county up into

1103
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,039
multiple regions and each one of those

1104
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:24,680
regions has its own unique heritage its

1105
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,690
own unique strains its own unique

1106
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:31,649
communities and will eventually create

1107
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:34,920
its own unique brand around that story

1108
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:39,000
so being able to do this and being able

1109
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,740
to split these regions up into these

1110
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,449
cultural hubs will allow us to

1111
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:46,679
distribute our cannabis at a higher

1112
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:48,569
price remain small cooperate know your

1113
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:50,759
neighbor know your distributor know your

1114
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,080
market come down to Los Angeles like

1115
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,490
we're doing right now and actually

1116
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,099
telling that story through the Emerald

1117
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:59,039
exchange I'm not trying to selflessly

1118
00:46:56,099 --> 00:47:01,929
name drop it just like where I work

1119
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,429
like but I mean basically we have these

1120
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:05,710
entertainment events we come down we

1121
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:07,599
tell the story we bring the products we

1122
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:11,470
talk about the small batch and the

1123
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:13,029
lifestyle so it's the idea is that like

1124
00:47:11,469 --> 00:47:15,759
I said I feel like I'm cheating because

1125
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:18,400
this is though I just live this life and

1126
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,840
it just and I feel so optimistic like

1127
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,710
what I said was are kind of depressed

1128
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:27,160
I'm also just as hopeful because no one

1129
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:29,380
can ever take away our place there's no

1130
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:31,179
one that's ever gonna be able to grow a

1131
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,160
calm sea cush there's no one ever gonna

1132
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:35,669
be able to grow a spy Rock Sour Diesel

1133
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:37,899
all of these all of these epigenetic

1134
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:40,030
expressions are happening in those

1135
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:44,260
regions specifically you can't recreate

1136
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:46,480
it so I really believe that through that

1137
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:49,780
story of cultural heritage that you know

1138
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,570
I mean I believe we're gonna be alright

1139
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:54,640
in that region I don't believe all of us

1140
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:58,170
are I think we have like 30,000 plus

1141
00:47:54,639 --> 00:48:01,559
farmers but 80 percent of us if not more

1142
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:04,690
well way more than 80 percent are not

1143
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:07,799
legal at all and we're talking about I

1144
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:10,769
think we have 200 legal cultivation

1145
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:14,470
licenses in Mendocino County right now

1146
00:48:10,769 --> 00:48:16,780
going into the market and every single

1147
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:20,469
gate on my Ridge is locked because

1148
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:23,590
there's cannabis behind it so and that's

1149
00:48:20,469 --> 00:48:27,399
one Ridge I can count over 200 people so

1150
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:29,260
I mean by no means is this you know

1151
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,380
gonna win it for everyone but it's

1152
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:37,180
definitely a good shot moving forward

1153
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:40,840
Thanks yep I kind of forgot what the

1154
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:45,279
question was honestly so how do we

1155
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:47,920
educate consumers to support the real

1156
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,990
grassroots movement of cannabis that

1157
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,200
kept this movement going through

1158
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:56,799
prohibition thank you and I didn't even

1159
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:59,319
get stoned today so I guess here here's

1160
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:03,100
what I would say I think there's in here

1161
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:05,280
there's probably 10 media companies

1162
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:08,289
filming right now I think there's

1163
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,540
wonderful events Tampa sitting back

1164
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:12,250
there from the Eroica

1165
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:14,880
Sampath exchange here I think there's

1166
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:19,630
places that that educate both

1167
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:22,450
experientially and in written print

1168
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:25,000
digital form that are putting out

1169
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:28,689
stories in a great way that they kind of

1170
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,389
bring that feeling that the cannabis is

1171
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:33,909
normal that marijuana is safer than

1172
00:49:31,389 --> 00:49:36,009
alcohol as our friend Mason put it out

1173
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:38,859
there many years ago and helped change

1174
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:40,720
the world and I think that's the biggest

1175
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:42,550
thing that anyone here can do is tell

1176
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:45,669
that story because humans are

1177
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:47,080
storytelling people like that's we all

1178
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:50,320
want to gather around the fire and

1179
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:51,880
listen and I think back to his Joseph

1180
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,200
Campbell reference thank you for that

1181
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,980
was that wasn't made this my favorite

1182
00:49:53,199 --> 00:50:00,299
panel but you know I think if you look

1183
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:04,059
at it as a way for people to go and

1184
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:06,880
normalize and and make cannabis not

1185
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:10,329
something that's scary or dirty or makes

1186
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:12,250
your grandfather smoke crack I think

1187
00:50:10,329 --> 00:50:15,190
there's there's a lot of things that you

1188
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:17,800
can do just all the people sitting here

1189
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:20,440
all the the media companies all of the

1190
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:23,440
event companies all these people who are

1191
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,670
who are out there telling the story you

1192
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,559
know this event right here is

1193
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:29,320
normalizing cannabis we're on the Queen

1194
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,000
Mary we're on a beautiful historic ship

1195
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,110
in the middle of Long Beach and having a

1196
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,489
kind of his event with a bunch of

1197
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:36,579
tourists walking around and I think

1198
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:38,919
people seeing that it's not scary that

1199
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:42,730
it's not dirty that it's not something

1200
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:45,250
that's gonna lead to some terrible other

1201
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:48,369
thing which what it's leading to is not

1202
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:50,559
is was never that in the first place but

1203
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:52,750
just convincing people that all of it

1204
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,840
was propaganda that it's all bullshit

1205
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:58,539
that that utilizing cannabis is a right

1206
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:00,460
is a natural plant-based medicine as

1207
00:50:58,539 --> 00:51:02,529
there are many other plant-based

1208
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:05,380
medicines that are currently outlawed by

1209
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:08,080
the system because they create people

1210
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:10,300
who question they create people who who

1211
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:13,059
want to understand more who want to seek

1212
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:15,670
and search and that's not good for a

1213
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:17,730
controlled system and so it really comes

1214
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:20,800
down to people messaging that and

1215
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:22,960
creating great content great events

1216
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,100
great other things that you can interact

1217
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,800
with and take

1218
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:28,839
and tell that story to your friends and

1219
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,300
your family and their friends and their

1220
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,370
family and you wind up that's the most

1221
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:35,500
powerful thing in the world you know the

1222
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:37,509
the most powerful thing is not something

1223
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,340
someone tells you to do it's what you

1224
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:41,440
feel internally and want to tell

1225
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,539
everyone else and you want to give that

1226
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,400
so I think that's probably the most

1227
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:47,469
powerful thing that people can do here

1228
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,510
and and I think they're doing it right

1229
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:51,250
now I think it's it's happening here

1230
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:53,080
it's happening in other places you know

1231
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:55,090
there's there's events all over the

1232
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:57,190
country now where cannabis is normal

1233
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:59,620
aware it's it feels like something

1234
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:01,960
that's just integrated into normal life

1235
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:05,079
and that's the probably the best way we

1236
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:07,420
can really win this war in a final way

1237
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:10,690
when people are like I don't believe you

1238
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:13,389
I don't believe that cannabis is a drug

1239
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:16,119
I just don't believe that this is a bad

1240
00:52:13,389 --> 00:52:18,099
substance is gonna hurt people we went

1241
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:22,509
it's over they can't keep fighting this

1242
00:52:18,099 --> 00:52:24,279
anymore Thanks I think how many people

1243
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:26,380
just to kind of wrap up on the idea of

1244
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:29,290
the media and how we portray ourselves

1245
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:32,200
to the people outside this room whether

1246
00:52:29,289 --> 00:52:34,480
they're with us against us or curious

1247
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:37,599
how many people remember like when

1248
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,210
Colorado legalized shows like pop barons

1249
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:43,659
of Colorado and Marijuana ink and making

1250
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:47,559
a shitload of money off weed and the the

1251
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:50,619
cash kings of cannabis and all that well

1252
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:54,369
well what that was was the corporate

1253
00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:56,049
media coming into our world and deciding

1254
00:52:54,369 --> 00:52:58,480
for us what stories were gonna tell

1255
00:52:56,050 --> 00:53:00,010
about ourselves and they wanted to tell

1256
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,190
those stories because it lets them off

1257
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:07,570
the hook for being the propaganda wing

1258
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:11,340
of prohibition for convincing for a

1259
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:14,170
hundred years everyone in this country

1260
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:17,170
that they were right and we were wrong

1261
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:21,119
that we were people of low value that we

1262
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:23,500
XY and Z deserve to go to jail basically

1263
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:27,069
the stories that they didn't want to

1264
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:29,260
tell were about our real community about

1265
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,010
our farmers about our small

1266
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,870
businesspeople

1267
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:34,090
about people who'd been trampled by this

1268
00:53:31,869 --> 00:53:37,239
war I didn't see a lot of shows like

1269
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:37,930
that and there's a reason the New York

1270
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:42,159
Times

1271
00:53:37,929 --> 00:53:45,399
endorse legalization until 2014 that's

1272
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:47,048
fucking ridiculous you're supposed to be

1273
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,059
the paper of record you're supposed to

1274
00:53:47,048 --> 00:53:52,358
be intelligent people you couldn't

1275
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:54,789
figure that out until 2014 the Denver

1276
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:57,818
Post told everybody in an editorial to

1277
00:53:54,789 --> 00:54:00,819
vote against legalization guess what

1278
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:03,099
they did like three months later they

1279
00:54:00,818 --> 00:54:05,409
started the cannabis t' so that they

1280
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:07,119
could cash in i know good people who

1281
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:08,769
worked at the cannabis i think they put

1282
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,680
out a great product I'm not knocking

1283
00:54:08,769 --> 00:54:13,480
them but what I'm saying is that's how

1284
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:16,419
this corporate media works that's how

1285
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:18,880
they see a same fuckin way and guess

1286
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:20,829
what happened to the cannabis it got

1287
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,338
shut down because a bunch of hedge funds

1288
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:26,650
assholes bought the newspaper and that's

1289
00:54:24,338 --> 00:54:29,409
what's happening to the media okay how

1290
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:34,358
many farmers remember when it was four

1291
00:54:29,409 --> 00:54:39,338
or five grand for a pound yeah fuck yeah

1292
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:43,960
what is it now yeah I I don't remember

1293
00:54:39,338 --> 00:54:46,078
I'm not as old but two bucks a word used

1294
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:49,740
to be a good rate for a writer

1295
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:52,510
it ain't anymore let me fuck to tell you

1296
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:54,368
the same things the two things that I've

1297
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:57,430
worked in my whole life are the media

1298
00:54:54,369 --> 00:54:59,890
and cannabis I see the influence of

1299
00:54:57,429 --> 00:55:01,629
corporate America on both of them so

1300
00:54:59,889 --> 00:55:03,699
when you look at your news stories and

1301
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:06,338
you look at your storytellers and you

1302
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:08,230
decide what are the stories we're gonna

1303
00:55:06,338 --> 00:55:10,778
tell about ourselves and to each other

1304
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:15,490
and to the rest of the world that really

1305
00:55:10,778 --> 00:55:17,949
matters support the kind of media that

1306
00:55:15,489 --> 00:55:21,639
you believe in support the kind of media

1307
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:25,358
that reflects the values of not just

1308
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:28,538
this community but this plant thank you

1309
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:30,969
and thank you to our entire panel it was

1310
00:55:28,539 --> 00:55:32,559
really one cool it was a diverse group

1311
00:55:30,969 --> 00:55:34,449
of people please come up and ask

1312
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,569
questions please come up and hang out

1313
00:55:34,449 --> 00:55:39,568
with us I'm sorry we didn't have a Q&amp;A

1314
00:55:36,568 --> 00:55:39,568
what

1315
00:55:42,429 --> 00:55:49,969
start here we go the food doesn't start

1316
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:52,010
until 5:40 so I liked the direction that

1317
00:55:49,969 --> 00:55:54,618
this panel headed and I think when we're

1318
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:57,290
talking about small and craft we can

1319
00:55:54,619 --> 00:56:00,079
also talk about small craft events and

1320
00:55:57,289 --> 00:56:02,179
there's a big sort of yeah it's funny I

1321
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:04,430
look at sort of who puts on events and

1322
00:56:02,179 --> 00:56:06,618
you know the event later this week in

1323
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:08,358
downtown LA it's big its corporate it's

1324
00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:10,849
an event production company that just

1325
00:56:08,358 --> 00:56:12,469
looks at industries and says you know

1326
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:14,050
the banking industry there's money to be

1327
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:16,129
made throwing events there the

1328
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:18,260
healthcare industry let's launch the

1329
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:20,660
healthcare event series Oh cannabis we

1330
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:22,640
can make money there and then you have

1331
00:56:20,659 --> 00:56:25,068
people who are doing sort of the small

1332
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:26,719
craft events and I just wanted to say

1333
00:56:25,068 --> 00:56:29,239
it's appreciated that you all come to

1334
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:30,949
events like this definitely go to the

1335
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:33,098
downtown event but it's important to

1336
00:56:30,949 --> 00:56:38,509
come show up to events like this as well

1337
00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:43,849
which locally produced event by a local

1338
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:45,650
resident slash activist yeah so anyone

1339
00:56:43,849 --> 00:56:48,980
else have a question it was mentioned

1340
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:52,250
about you know people are still getting

1341
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:54,170
arrested for marijuana and um we have

1342
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:57,108
three strikes law that's still here

1343
00:56:54,170 --> 00:57:00,920
which means that if you get arrested for

1344
00:56:57,108 --> 00:57:04,190
a drug more than three times it's a

1345
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:07,608
felony and if you get arrested for three

1346
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:12,200
felonies that's life and I think that

1347
00:57:07,608 --> 00:57:14,449
that's pretty horror horrific but for

1348
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:19,239
the individuals that are incarcerated

1349
00:57:14,449 --> 00:57:22,279
right now for past marijuana laws I

1350
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:25,219
it was just on my mind like is there

1351
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:27,349
like thoughts and anybody's minds about

1352
00:57:25,219 --> 00:57:29,358
you know like counteracting that because

1353
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:31,880
I know that it's a lot of color people

1354
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:35,239
that are facing that and those are

1355
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:37,789
families that are ripped apart so I mean

1356
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:39,649
for us now like we all want to stay out

1357
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:40,969
but what about those people that you

1358
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:42,910
know have been locked up for years and

1359
00:57:40,969 --> 00:57:47,539
years and years over a couple joints

1360
00:57:42,909 --> 00:57:50,000
been prop 64 there are provisions for

1361
00:57:47,539 --> 00:57:52,308
expungement of records and for people to

1362
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,250
petition the government it's not it

1363
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:57,460
should be a blanket thing to just let

1364
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,460
peep

1365
00:57:57,789 --> 00:58:03,800
well no it passed I'm saying it the law

1366
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:05,599
that passed has includes some of those

1367
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,000
provisions and some local communities

1368
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:11,210
have chosen to expunge people's records

1369
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,519
even automatically San Francisco like

1370
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:15,559
like five hundred there was a number I

1371
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:18,559
saw a paper recently San Francisco let

1372
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:21,679
out some several hundred people that all

1373
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:24,320
had previous marijuana convictions I

1374
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:29,029
know for a fact they've done it Colorado

1375
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:31,730
did it in a big way 2015 it was some

1376
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:33,440
like billions of dollars in savings from

1377
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:36,019
letting these people out of jail that

1378
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,389
they were you know keeping in so again

1379
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:39,800
I'm gonna go back to making sure that we

1380
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,480
pay attention to local communities

1381
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,010
because local communities are going to

1382
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,199
be able to push on this like the city of

1383
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:46,640
San Francisco was able to so I mean

1384
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:49,099
people need to start leaning on Los

1385
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:51,049
Angeles and and you know Sacramento and

1386
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:52,159
these other cities in a way if you have

1387
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:53,990
some involvement in your local

1388
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:55,699
communities I feel like that's probably

1389
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:57,889
one of the best ways that we can right

1390
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:59,449
now because I'm 64 did allow for it

1391
00:58:57,889 --> 00:59:02,000
again similar to the way social equity

1392
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:03,559
is working the communities are going to

1393
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,360
have to stand up and do this the state

1394
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:07,759
as a whole as it stands right now is not

1395
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:11,090
but if you know San Francisco can do it

1396
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:14,030
anybody can we're talking about a lot

1397
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:15,950
about how we can as citizens at this low

1398
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:18,320
level interact with our government

1399
00:59:15,949 --> 00:59:20,629
officials both from a city level and

1400
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:23,690
state level but there's I feel like

1401
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:26,360
another opportunity that we have to be

1402
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:27,619
able to act as private citizens and I

1403
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,530
wanted to get the the panel's thoughts

1404
00:59:27,619 --> 00:59:33,170
on using concepts such as during during

1405
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:35,600
nullification to help prevent the

1406
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:37,039
conviction of of again like you

1407
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:41,509
mentioned people of color who have been

1408
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:43,369
uh neck without the drug war do you feel

1409
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:45,560
that that's something that we could

1410
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:46,880
educate not just here where we have

1411
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:48,409
legal markets medicinally and

1412
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:52,190
recreationally but nationwide

1413
00:59:48,409 --> 00:59:55,639
to help prevent further damage being

1414
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:57,860
done to to the equity of those of those

1415
00:59:55,639 --> 01:00:00,170
unfortunately targeted people I probably

1416
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:02,000
don't have a really great answer for you

1417
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:04,820
there are several criminal justice

1418
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,289
reform groups who who theorize and

1419
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:09,000
strategize around a question like that

1420
01:00:07,289 --> 01:00:11,420
I'm not sure that the cannabis industry

1421
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,070
is equipped for something as technical

1422
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:15,869
but it's certainly a good idea it's

1423
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:18,269
certainly juries we do understand are

1424
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:19,619
not representative they're not peers you

1425
01:00:18,269 --> 01:00:21,210
know who are convicting people

1426
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:23,099
historically speaking

1427
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:24,389
that's why Sheree selection is such a

1428
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:26,369
complicated thing and that's why people

1429
01:00:24,389 --> 01:00:28,650
hire expensive attorneys especially when

1430
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:31,199
they are looking at the you know threat

1431
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:31,889
of going to jail for life if you can't

1432
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:33,509
afford that

1433
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:37,379
otherwise if you're stuck with a

1434
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:41,700
criminal public defender right who has a

1435
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:44,039
caseload of 400 you know the the options

1436
01:00:41,699 --> 01:00:48,000
are much more limited I think that's

1437
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:51,989
creative I think you know stories or

1438
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,639
ideas like that are certainly ways in

1439
01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:58,949
which the cannabis industry could

1440
01:00:53,639 --> 01:01:00,929
contribute by you know in some sort of

1441
01:00:58,949 --> 01:01:03,089
reparations obviously what we've seen

1442
01:01:00,929 --> 01:01:06,000
mostly or have been these equity you

1443
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:08,460
know reform projects but I think that's

1444
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,590
why organizations like the ACLU are so

1445
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,900
important in arenas like this because

1446
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:14,789
they span their their intersectional

1447
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:17,160
right it's not just cannabis its its

1448
01:01:14,789 --> 01:01:20,029
criminal justice reform as well sorry

1449
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:24,659
that's probably not a good answer but

1450
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:26,280
yeah I just think to when you know add

1451
01:01:24,659 --> 01:01:28,619
to what you said I think the role for

1452
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,590
the industry and criminal justice reform

1453
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:33,719
is to support criminal justice reform

1454
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:35,940
financially and the people who've

1455
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:39,929
dedicated their lives to doing that

1456
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:41,130
don't need anything except resources you

1457
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,989
know there's specifically to jury

1458
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:45,090
nullification that's you know gets a

1459
01:01:42,989 --> 01:01:48,389
little into the weeds bad pun is my

1460
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:50,579
stock and trade but but on the grander

1461
01:01:48,389 --> 01:01:52,500
scale if you're making a lot of money

1462
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:54,690
off of this plant or off of this

1463
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,489
community or in a better way if you're

1464
