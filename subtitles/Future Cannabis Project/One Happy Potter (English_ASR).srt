1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,109
[Music]

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:08,390
and one week

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,279
[Applause]

4
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:25,449
and so okay so this plant died because

5
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:28,118
the filter got stuck and the plant

6
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:31,960
didn't get enough water yeah and this

7
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:34,299
fan which gives the start of the plant

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,109
circulation was pointed in that

9
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:38,018
direction

10
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:41,320
and so when the humidifier comes on at

11
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:48,329
night the humidity gets low so the

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:51,969
medium dried out and say you have it

13
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:56,308
these are Hugo's those are six by six

14
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:56,308
Hugo's grown 10 blocks

15
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:04,629
and then you have

16
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,780
[Music]

17
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:12,340
psycho nutrients company out of

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:14,620
Australia residual from the Western

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,170
ammonite group advancement and we're

20
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:20,049
playing classical music that's correct

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:22,090
[Applause]

22
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:24,359
are they enjoying the classical music

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,359
they too

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,909
and so wet so

25
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:33,750
each section and different cultivars yes

26
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:37,289
it is and bar one or over there those

27
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:46,189
are strawberry bananas yeah these are

28
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:49,050
wedding cake and those are gas leak I

29
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:57,090
got them from LA Genetics with the LA

30
00:01:49,049 --> 00:02:00,269
genetics I'd have to look it up well

31
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:04,020
I've grown the wedding cake before my

32
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:06,299
last operation was closed and this is a

33
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:08,340
little bit different than the variety

34
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,639
that I was growing but I was always

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,979
happy and so is my customer base and

36
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:19,339
I've grown the strawberry banana before

37
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:30,359
as well these are a thousand watt HPS

38
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:33,449
single-ended bulbs old-school I guess

39
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,330
the canopy in here is about 96 square

40
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:41,899
feet each table is a four by eight so

41
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,900
that's 32 square feet times three

42
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:51,679
[Applause]

43
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:56,799
totally automated it's a 55-gallon drum

44
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:59,390
and I'll use that for three days

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,540
the plants are drinking anywhere from

46
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:07,039
ten to let's say at this later stage

47
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:09,679
fifteen gallons a day and so I'll use

48
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:15,709
this mix for three days and then

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:21,230
whatever's left I dump and refill a and

50
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:23,420
B and all the other nutrients that are

51
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:25,489
needed during the different stages and

52
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:26,649
so what are some of those and you like

53
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,360
to add

54
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,300
so let's talk like Wonder

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,490
[Applause]

56
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,130
well in the beginning of the Amb the

57
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:44,379
growth is pretty simple so you have an A

58
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:55,719
and B you have a B vitamin a sign and a

59
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:57,729
cal-mag basically calcium magnesium well

60
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:03,129
later in the stage you'll out of silica

61
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:06,209
to provide strength and I guess density

62
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:12,959
as far as the base of your plant and

63
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:16,298
then added to to promote root growth and

64
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:21,910
then in the beginning stages of

65
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:25,569
flowering I'll add a potassium and a

66
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:28,510
nitrogen additive for the first couple

67
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:34,029
of weeks and then phase that out for

68
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:37,089
what the the nitrogen based additive

69
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:41,829
helps keep the plants green because in

70
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:44,949
the changeover from metal halide to HPS

71
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:49,599
it can be light shock and then that will

72
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:52,329
start yellowing out your leaves and the

73
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,390
nitrogen helps number one with the

74
00:04:52,329 --> 00:05:00,930
continued root development as well as

75
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:00,930
the keeps the leaves nice and green

76
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,300
when you're nearing the finish line you

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:17,770
want to give some sweeteners and a blood

78
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:23,370
partner a bat guano provides a little

79
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:30,519
bit of taste as well for that old-school

80
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:33,040
terpene development and through the

81
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,839
stages you'll ramp up your ppm which is

82
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,480
your parts per million as far as the

83
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:41,019
nutrient level and then at the end

84
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:46,030
you'll start to phase that off so what

85
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:50,168
do you I'd say about fourteen or fifteen

86
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:52,299
hundred if it gets the 1600 that's not

87
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:54,930
really a big worry but not really any

88
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,930
harder than that

89
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:03,829
and then so talk about what you were

90
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,610
like back in any were you in the city

91
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:07,240
anymore

92
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:12,020
yeah I mean I grew up in New York and

93
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:20,329
I've had grows in Manhattan Queens and

94
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:23,719
Brooklyn it was I started out in an

95
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:25,609
apartment there was above mine I sublet

96
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,710
in an apartment when one of my neighbors

97
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,110
was moving out and they wanted to keep

98
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:31,879
the apartment so I subletted it for a

99
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:36,020
couple of years and that's where I

100
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:39,069
taught myself how to grow and then later

101
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:40,959
on I was able to get a warehouse and

102
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:44,529
[Music]

103
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,529
expand it from there

104
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,819
and kind of what were the what was this

105
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:55,270
like in the mid-90s or yeah midnight so

106
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:58,330
what was high in New York

107
00:06:55,269 --> 00:07:00,370
well the genetics that I had available

108
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:03,310
to me were you know feeling far between

109
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:06,848
because it's not like you can broadcast

110
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,470
what you're doing and it's hard to find

111
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:17,348
like-minded individuals

112
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:18,940
so everybody keeps to themselves and so

113
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:21,360
actually you're keeping it pretty cool

114
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,439
in there at night sauna

115
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,348
why not I'm saying like right now during

116
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,930
the day it feels like it's like in the

117
00:07:26,348 --> 00:07:31,469
sixties it's about 68 in there yeah and

118
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,579
I can check my greenhouse growers

119
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:37,000
controller to tell you exactly where

120
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:40,649
it's out like that in the later stages

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,759
yes okay that promotes the purpleness

122
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:47,829
would come out so in like kind of peak

123
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,288
growth you don't feel like you need to

124
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:53,978
keep it that you're no in impede growth

125
00:07:50,288 --> 00:08:01,959
I go anywhere from 72 to 78 and there

126
00:07:53,978 --> 00:08:04,990
get as high as 80 okay so what so you

127
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:09,388
were growing what in New York in the 90s

128
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:14,288
and the 90 I was growing Northern Lights

129
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:15,968
by Hawaiian and then Afghan okay

130
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:17,709
and where were you sourcing those

131
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:20,740
genetics from given that you couldn't be

132
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:25,288
like I flew over to Amsterdam to get

133
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:29,340
seeds okay that's smuggle them back and

134
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:29,339
yeah started the process

135
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:38,629
and what was okay so that's what you're

136
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,969
growing in New York and then you moved

137
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:46,789
out to Seattle I moved to Seattle

138
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:49,430
basically any of these underground

139
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:53,750
operations that I've had haven't really

140
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:55,429
lasted more than three years and there's

141
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,830
no good time for a bad thing to happen

142
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:59,689
so when it happens you're not

143
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,028
necessarily you know prepared for

144
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,640
something like that to go wrong but then

145
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:06,320
you had to deal with the consequences so

146
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,740
did something happen in New York yeah

147
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,170
the warehouse that I had which was my

148
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:16,690
major source of income was broken into

149
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:21,049
and the police showed up and arrested

150
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:25,790
the thieves and then put the grow on

151
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:26,719
them so I was able to come out of that

152
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:29,778
unscathed

153
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,820
they got the double whammy of breaking

154
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:36,230
in and then being accused of it being

155
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:38,360
their dro operation yeah well you just

156
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,190
never went back to that exactly right

157
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,129
yeah wash my hands I don't what are you

158
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:46,100
trying to steal the flower or the flower

159
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:48,259
trying to find money or usually you know

160
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,360
you keep those two separate there's no

161
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:53,929
reason to keep and it's product and you

162
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,190
grow or money and and did they note so

163
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:57,949
they knew that you had just harvested

164
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,620
her nose right before I was gonna

165
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:03,980
harvest it was a really hard blow and

166
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,360
the smells weren't entirely contained at

167
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,629
that point because they were really

168
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,269
really stinky at that point and so you

169
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:13,490
think someone smelled it told their

170
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:15,769
friends and their friends games yeah I

171
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,539
mean as large as New York is it's also a

172
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:21,470
small tight-knit community

173
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:23,889
especially in that arena and the

174
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:28,279
warehouse that I had was a girl before

175
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:32,129
right so the

176
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:34,589
yes the nuance is that if it was a grow

177
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:36,179
then then it's a grown now so let's see

178
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,009
about if they were arrested you knew who

179
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:40,439
it was I found out I know who it was

180
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:41,850
and were you like oh I know those guys I

181
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,620
knew who they were okay

182
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:47,639
were you like you guys are assholes no

183
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:50,250
question right and okay so that's why

184
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:54,960
you left New York that was the beginning

185
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:58,320
of the end so after that's where it's

186
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:03,120
about there were two levels for about 25

187
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,640
to 22 on each floor so if one flow is

188
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,539
2,500 the other one was 2,200 so just

189
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:13,289
under 5,000 square feet and both were

190
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:18,240
going on opposite and you were you

191
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:21,589
getting like four turns each I had a

192
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,350
vegetative room so they were popping

193
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:28,740
every four to five weeks that was

194
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:30,899
harvesting one or the other okay then

195
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,629
then you go to Seattle when you kind of

196
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:36,959
like did you know people there this yeah

197
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:39,360
so then when the warehouse closed down

198
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,600
before I moved to Seattle I bought a

199
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,960
house upstate and then grew upstate New

200
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,730
York

201
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:50,580
yeah right outside Albany and that was a

202
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:53,190
commute of about and hour 45 minutes two

203
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:58,230
hours each way and I did that for about

204
00:11:53,190 --> 00:12:02,100
two years and then during a storm the

205
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:06,560
transformer blew and when the power

206
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:08,639
company came to replace it and I was

207
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,609
obviously paying for power I wasn't

208
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:15,299
stealing it but they saw that there was

209
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:19,019
a lot of usage went in that area and so

210
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:21,870
they visited my house and on paper my

211
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,970
house was listed as a farm so it wasn't

212
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,889
at a source that a farm would be using

213
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,080
that sort of power but then when they

214
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:30,110
saw it was just a residence they

215
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,020
investigated further and

216
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,570
alerted the authorities and then closed

217
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:38,389
it down

218
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:41,810
that was how many Smurfs you going up

219
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:46,909
there I had about 30 lights in that

220
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:50,000
house and said the cops coming like did

221
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:51,889
you take offer to you I had somebody

222
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,690
working for me at that point and they

223
00:12:51,889 --> 00:13:03,379
were going back and forth and they

224
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:05,390
followed that person and then they

225
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:08,929
arrested them they detained them and

226
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:11,240
they some they were you know terrified

227
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:14,349
at the prospect of being locked up they

228
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,850
were a green heart green card holder and

229
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,700
they scared them into telling them what

230
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:22,279
was going on and so they were arrested

231
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:26,020
and then they put out a warrant for my

232
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,019
arrest and then I surrendered and

233
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:34,069
started that whole horrible process so

234
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,650
what was the outcome of that they wanted

235
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:40,010
to give me a felony and you know give me

236
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:42,949
jail time but the land that I was on was

237
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:46,429
privately owned and they were on my

238
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:48,830
property dressed as the Power Company so

239
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:51,799
there were a bunch of holes in the way

240
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,900
that they approached it and I just held

241
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:57,409
Pat and my lawyer told them all that I

242
00:13:53,899 --> 00:14:00,559
wasn't it willing to take a plea and at

243
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:04,039
the end of that I accepted a misdemeanor

244
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,809
charge with time served so it was

245
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:07,610
basically you know a slap on the wrist I

246
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:18,619
didn't even really have to pay a fine so

247
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:19,639
basically they all right so that so then

248
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,220
you move out west

249
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:24,110
then I asked buddies you know like what

250
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,490
can I do you know I got to recreate

251
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,370
myself you know do you have any

252
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:31,460
opportunities for me and so I moved out

253
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,610
to Seattle and work with some people

254
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,660
that I had known from New York and

255
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,970
started growing for them they had a

256
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:42,949
small underground network and they were

257
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:50,149
on the cusp of going legal and they had

258
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:52,070
a really genuine genetic that they were

259
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,819
working with that was highly touted it

260
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,830
was it was an OG stream and I grew that

261
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,470
for them and I increased their

262
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:03,680
production and all their various grows

263
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,840
and talked to people that they had in

264
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,500
there on the ground network how to get

265
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:12,230
more out of the plants and then they

266
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,240
opened the cells all right so two things

267
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,250
tell me about the genetics and like

268
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,610
everything from how it grew to how it

269
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:22,549
looked as a colloid how it smelled how

270
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,379
it smoked and then also what were some

271
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:27,649
of the things they were or we're not

272
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:32,470
doing that you were like oh let's do XY

273
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:34,459
and Z and increase yield and well the

274
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,639
genetics that they were working with was

275
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:40,310
an OG I guess I don't necessarily want

276
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:44,689
to be too specific as to which one but

277
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:47,269
they had an original og and oh geez a

278
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:50,540
notoriously finicky so you had to

279
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:53,480
provide the correct environment for them

280
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:56,209
to thrive and so they like a high

281
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,279
humidity and vegetative state and then

282
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,440
that humidity has to drop off at a

283
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:03,980
certain stage in order to get the most

284
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:08,930
out of the plant also the plant was kind

285
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:11,420
of spindly and that if you didn't rain

286
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:13,459
it then the branches wouldn't be strong

287
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:16,309
enough to hold the buds that you

288
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:19,340
actually would want out of that and so I

289
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:22,339
set up trellis systems for them control

290
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:25,339
their environment and then not so much

291
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:29,579
super crop does actually

292
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:33,120
training the plants giving them stress

293
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:36,049
along their growing period in order to

294
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,049
make them stronger

295
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,600
so that was Seattle and then from there

296
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:50,159
you came out here from Seattle I moved

297
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,850
to Oakland and then I lived in Oakland

298
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:57,419
with a buddy of mine and he had to grow

299
00:16:52,850 --> 00:17:03,389
underneath his house and we grew a great

300
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:08,519
ape and it's the ballpark what year was

301
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:13,230
this this was at this point about eight

302
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:16,859
years ago yes so 2011 2010 to 2011 I

303
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:20,459
lived in Oakland and we grew grape ape

304
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:23,039
and the shadow scene was just burgeoning

305
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:26,578
so we would sell our flower and then

306
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,168
turn all the waste into shadow and we

307
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:31,649
were working with different dispensaries

308
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:35,340
in the area and the problems that I ran

309
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,990
into there was that my partner had one

310
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:39,928
way of doing things and I had another

311
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:43,380
and so too many cooks in the kitchen

312
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:45,480
so the hearts weren't always uniform and

313
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:49,230
so at the end of the day it wasn't as

314
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,419
profitable as it could have been and he

315
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:55,048
didn't want to acquiesce as to his

316
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:57,120
control and I had my way of doing things

317
00:17:55,048 --> 00:18:01,410
problem beings that I was going back and

318
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:03,928
forth from Oakland to the east coast to

319
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,179
visit my children because I hadn't saved

320
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:07,798
enough money in order to move them and I

321
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,679
had narrowed down a place where I was

322
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:12,099
willing to move my

323
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:15,038
family open is an armpit not a place

324
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:16,959
that I wanted to raise my children so at

325
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:20,349
some point our relationship became

326
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,769
untenable and a buddy of mine who lived

327
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:25,990
in LA had an opportunity for me to take

328
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:29,829
over a grow that wasn't doing well and

329
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:34,329
so I moved to Los Angeles and then what

330
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:37,319
uh what were you growing there and when

331
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:40,269
I first came to LA yeah blue dream

332
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:42,638
it's a popular stream popular spring I

333
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:45,548
can't go wrong with that so talk to me I

334
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:48,158
mean New York upstate New York New York

335
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:50,079
City upstate New York Seattle Oakland

336
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:52,149
down to LA like what are some of the

337
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,788
differences you noticed in each market

338
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:58,839
like in terms of wood what's hot what's

339
00:18:54,788 --> 00:19:03,278
selling what people want on the East

340
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:07,959
Coast at that point there was a big cry

341
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:10,210
for a Sour Diesel and Purple Haze and I

342
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,669
guess a lot of Sour Diesel was coming

343
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:17,278
from the west coast and the Purple Haze

344
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:20,788
was coming from basically Florida and I

345
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:23,618
had a niche market I was growing

346
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:25,628
Strawberry Cough at that point right

347
00:19:23,618 --> 00:19:29,378
before you know everything went haywire

348
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:34,839
and that was a sativa indica Krauss

349
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:37,148
mostly sativa which had a really nice

350
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:40,529
effect in that you could smoke it and

351
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:44,159
not be couched and then

352
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:46,799
it would let you off nicely could be

353
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,960
creative on it why not and so I was

354
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,960
supplying the underground to spent I

355
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:58,230
mean uh delivery services at that point

356
00:19:51,960 --> 00:20:02,640
I think that once I moved to Seattle

357
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:06,299
then that being a West Coast market the

358
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,690
OGIS were really what the public was

359
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:11,779
crying for and really wanted and I found

360
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:18,299
that to be consistent from there down to

361
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:22,769
down here so the Blue Dream

362
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:27,329
I think didn't have a big hold in the

363
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:29,940
East Coast they call it pretend oka you

364
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:31,439
know it smells nice it looks nice but it

365
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,180
doesn't you know whack you over the head

366
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,289
it's not you know it's not for the

367
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,850
streets and it does it did very well in

368
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:44,839
dispensaries and you know they couldn't

369
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:48,629
get enough of it but the the market here

370
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:51,000
also feeds the market over there so you

371
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:54,680
kind of have to especially in the

372
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,140
underground market at that point had to

373
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:00,269
focus on where your market was and where

374
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:04,460
you were getting the most money for your

375
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:08,069
end product and it seemed that everybody

376
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:11,430
who was working in New York and the

377
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:16,429
industry had a friend in California so a

378
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:18,779
lot a lot of times the end product would

379
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:23,310
go out of state and I think that that's

380
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:26,490
still true and the dispensary market was

381
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:28,710
not something that once I had my own

382
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:31,380
operation I was particularly interested

383
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:36,809
in because of the way that the payout

384
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:38,880
works they weren't paying cash on the

385
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:41,409
Barrelhead you had to go back and forth

386
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,690
and have it on consignment

387
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:52,690
that's you know not necessarily the most

388
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:55,299
attractive talk about kind of pricing

389
00:21:52,690 --> 00:22:00,720
trends over the past however many years

390
00:21:55,299 --> 00:22:03,879
oh my goodness yeah last year per pound

391
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:25,930
in the early 90s I was getting anywhere

392
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:30,730
from 5502 6593 that was grown in the

393
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:32,650
Midwest yeah okay and they and so tell

394
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,660
me about the Midwest market like are we

395
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:38,740
talking like Michigan like is what's

396
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:43,870
kind of the dominant Midwest Indiana

397
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:47,740
Ohio Kentucky area the farmers out there

398
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:52,179
they grow corn basically and the

399
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:53,890
secondary market is marijuana so they're

400
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,200
they're growing outdoors yeah this is

401
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,870
outdoor and they're just kind of hiding

402
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:03,250
it in the cornfield exactly that exactly

403
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:06,329
that so the the farmers out there and

404
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:09,099
this is like this is late 80s early 90s

405
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:13,809
and what we're kind of the dominant like

406
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:16,959
Midwestern back then weren't the extreme

407
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:19,960
there weren't really anything any real

408
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:24,549
names that were attached to the product

409
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:28,360
it was either good or it wasn't largely

410
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:31,149
indica based some sativas but uh you

411
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:36,869
know forearm buds you know like healthy

412
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:36,870
healthy outdoor excellent product

413
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:45,849
there came a time though where the

414
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:47,500
cocaine dealers in New York switched

415
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:52,209
from that business to the marijuana

416
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:55,690
business and the opportunity is

417
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:58,630
available for middlemen dried up unless

418
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:01,170
you can speak Spanish so I was getting

419
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:05,710
squeezed out of that market and I

420
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:07,480
adapted and became a producer rather

421
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,910
than a middleman and that's what drove

422
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,920
me into soy so why is that because if

423
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,900
you're sourcing from the Midwest it's

424
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,110
not spanish-speaking and you're selling

425
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:19,930
in New York where is it because there is

426
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:22,839
a lot of Mexican week coming up it came

427
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:28,210
from everywhere basically uh Mexico

428
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:32,049
California but not speaking Spanish was

429
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:40,529
a hindrance to the underground market

430
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:46,619
yeah the major outlets for retail or

431
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:50,910
basically the delivery services and

432
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:50,909
Corner street sellers

433
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:05,140
and there was a large I guess

434
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:08,120
marketplace at the bridge-and-tunnel

435
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:11,620
points so across from the George

436
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:16,429
Washington Bridge is Washington Heights

437
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:19,069
very well known drug market and the out

438
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,470
of Staters will come over the bridge and

439
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:24,950
stop in that area to get there and then

440
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:26,930
just go and then go right back yeah so I

441
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:31,509
had connections up there but that

442
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:34,519
community is all Latin okay yeah

443
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:41,900
so it basically changed from you know

444
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:47,450
the Harlem guys to the Latin guys being

445
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:56,180
the gangs that were controlling what

446
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:58,309
industries right so that's like the

447
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:02,420
middle ground between Washington Heights

448
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:07,009
and Harlem okay so that's when you were

449
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:08,750
like I need to be growing my own there

450
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:11,569
was a lot more competition and the

451
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:14,690
numbers started dropping so the numbers

452
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:17,990
went from you know five five six down to

453
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:20,660
five and then from five down to forty

454
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:24,349
five at forty five I'm you know I'm

455
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:27,670
tripping out now like I was making so

456
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,669
much more money just a minute ago

457
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:41,289
and so alright so and it's down to 45

458
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:47,500
around what year that had to be mm mm

459
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:50,918
one night maybe late 90s that you know

460
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:57,548
late 90s early 2000s and then as you

461
00:26:50,919 --> 00:27:00,160
move to like Seattle which was what 10

462
00:26:57,548 --> 00:27:04,379
years later yeah at that point in it

463
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,380
dropped to about between 28 and 32

464
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:18,279
it was around 28 then dropped between 28

465
00:27:15,548 --> 00:27:21,519
sometimes 26 depending upon when the

466
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:22,539
outdoors came down and then when I moved

467
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:26,829
to Los Angeles

468
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:31,899
it was pretty steady at 28 and that went

469
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:37,029
from 28 all high-end Endora that was my

470
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:42,759
market and then the bottom of the market

471
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:50,440
was like late 2017 in the 2018

472
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:53,609
they're down to like 1,600 1,400 for Bom

473
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,610
Bom indoors

474
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,670
and then now what are you kind of seeing

475
00:27:55,769 --> 00:28:01,309
it climbing back up - well recently it's

476
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:04,759
gone

477
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:10,619
look 6-8 months ago it was still around

478
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:14,970
1618 and that method right now is 119 an

479
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:19,889
hour September basically 2019 at 22 to

480
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:23,600
28 and what are your projections for you

481
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:25,770
think it's gonna hold steady there the

482
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,629
the government has gotten involved

483
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:30,269
because it's pushed back from big

484
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:34,910
companies to get rid of the black market

485
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:39,180
and there's been a lot of closures of

486
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:42,570
warehouses as of late and also a

487
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:47,220
crackdown on the light up and outdoor

488
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:52,889
farming thanks of unlicensed easel right

489
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:56,009
the diesel moderator yeah so that's

490
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,900
drawing prices up again and so whoever

491
00:28:56,009 --> 00:29:02,789
still in business is obviously

492
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:05,790
benefiting from that though it's become

493
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:07,649
a commodity and then there's obviously

494
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:12,779
because of that that there's higher

495
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:14,610
demand it's aspiring that and talk about

496
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,990
because you said you've also grown

497
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:17,519
outdoors to arrive

498
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:21,809
I've grown outdoors a couple of

499
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:29,309
different times the product isn't as

500
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:31,659
good and certainly for my market the the

501
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,159
discerning customer

502
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,380
just wanna make sure that there pull

503
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,690
that uh but but when you're defining a

504
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:42,880
good product is it based on like look

505
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:44,680
and THC old-school heads can tell

506
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,770
whether or not it's grown outdoors and

507
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:51,310
grown indoors some people can't and so

508
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:56,039
there are some times where you'll get a

509
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:59,589
light up that's passing for an in and I

510
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:02,559
guess certainly there's more margins to

511
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:05,169
be made there but I like my product to

512
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,789
sell itself and I don't want to have

513
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,970
anybody come back and tell me that it

514
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:12,759
wasn't what I said it was so I've always

515
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:15,850
dealt with environments that I can

516
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:19,410
control and if I'm gonna put my stamp on

517
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:23,199
it it's gonna be the bomb hey number one

518
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:25,870
in growing outdoors there are so many

519
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,350
variables that you can't control and so

520
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:32,579
then you're at the whim of nature and

521
00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:36,279
the like I said the end product is it's

522
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:37,720
certainly not up to snuff well I think

523
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:40,299
it depends to who though because I know

524
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:45,549
plenty of bright amazing cultivators who

525
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:48,099
or old school people who can tell endure

526
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:52,869
and don't like it right I know this is

527
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:55,119
an allure to the Sun grown product like

528
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:59,309
for me I'm always kind of like you don't

529
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,309
drink wine that was grown from

530
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:06,139
it's kind of like like I feel like Endor

531
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:10,750
obviously has the bag appeal because it

532
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:14,690
looks perfect and you can crank up the

533
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:17,349
THC percentages and really for the

534
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:20,028
streets dusty and resolve the rest how I

535
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:22,579
guess what I'm getting at is like the

536
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:24,140
judgement of what is and is not good is

537
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:27,859
different for different people right

538
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:30,019
right so your average la market consumer

539
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:36,678
is basically does this look like a shiny

540
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:40,609
red apple is it dripping with THC what

541
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:45,559
about when a like kind of purple punch

542
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:48,939
and kind of like I'm just thinking of

543
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:51,168
things that were desirable and ablate

544
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:55,429
trends you've noticed that it become

545
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:58,399
fads and desirable in the market I guess

546
00:31:55,429 --> 00:32:02,750
there's a lot of different strains that

547
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:05,178
have presented themselves that I guess

548
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:09,409
gets some noise but then that noise kind

549
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:13,159
of quiets down so it may be hot for a

550
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:16,220
minute and then it's not gorilla glue

551
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:17,840
for for instance like there was a time

552
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:21,829
where you couldn't grow enough of it and

553
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:24,829
then people was like well okay I've had

554
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:26,329
enough of that and so then you have all

555
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:30,829
this gorilla glue and then you can't get

556
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:33,888
rid of it and then another strain will

557
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:35,990
be heard in a rap song or whatnot and

558
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:40,038
then it becomes desirable and then you

559
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:42,589
run to that for me that's I try and

560
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:45,169
stick with the tried and true oh geez

561
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:48,859
will always be marketable because they

562
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:51,320
do what you want them to do and it's a

563
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:54,379
smell that's reminiscent of what you're

564
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:58,460
accustomed to much the same as a Sour

565
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:01,610
Diesel I think that a lot of these

566
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:04,278
strains are really nothing but residual

567
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:09,500
from Northern Lights right the

568
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:16,808
grandfather of all the land race strains

569
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:21,079
and so for me I can't really gamble on

570
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:23,658
the what's new what's hot right now I

571
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:25,849
can't feed my family that way if it

572
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:28,490
takes a dip in the market and then

573
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:30,740
doesn't get what I thought it was going

574
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:33,620
to three months ago after going through

575
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:37,038
that process so I've always stuck to

576
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:41,648
what is tried-and-true and is

577
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:45,079
representative of what my market wants

578
00:33:41,648 --> 00:33:46,969
well having this if we forget the market

579
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:47,629
if you were just growing for yourself

580
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,298
mm-hmm

581
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:52,480
oh well those Purple's they they taste

582
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:56,388
nice you know and give you a nice effect

583
00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:00,169
but as a grower for instance purples

584
00:33:56,388 --> 00:34:02,298
take a lot longer to vegetate than some

585
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:04,788
of the other strains so then the

586
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:06,918
calendar is extended and then it cost

587
00:34:04,788 --> 00:34:09,679
you more to produce it and you're not

588
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:13,338
necessarily getting more for the product

589
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:16,068
at the end of the day so if it would be

590
00:34:13,338 --> 00:34:18,980
it first of all for me it's not a hobby

591
00:34:16,068 --> 00:34:20,628
it's a way of life but it thought we

592
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:22,639
just growing for myself I would have of

593
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:24,559
all those different varieties because

594
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,470
they taste nice they have different

595
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,699
effects and they also I guess they have

596
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:31,219
their moments when you would want to

597
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:33,710
consume that right when you said the

598
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:37,429
Purple's take why why is that the

599
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,659
take longer is it the flowering saves it

600
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:43,549
takes long though it's the vegetative

601
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:45,529
okay genetics do different things they

602
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:50,210
you know some plants mature faster than

603
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:52,190
others just like kids okay yeah and I

604
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,869
think that's a big driver especially in

605
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,409
the indoor market if like you know if

606
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:59,509
you look at the past thirty years of

607
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:03,349
what people have read towards right it's

608
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:09,200
like short plants you know fast

609
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:14,509
flowering I had this spring in a market

610
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:16,699
called Scentsy star it took two two and

611
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:19,750
a half weeks to grow large enough to

612
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:24,279
flower and with flower in six weeks

613
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:27,530
start to finish it's awesome

614
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:32,269
once my warehouse is closed I lost the

615
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:33,710
strain same with the strawberry actually

616
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:35,210
we used to call it strawberry I think

617
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:40,639
now it's more referred to as strawberry

618
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:43,099
call but that was a wonderful plant so

619
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,289
the sensi that would be an example of

620
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,639
something from a long time ago that you

621
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:49,159
wish you could get your hands on

622
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:54,650
Oh certainly I pretty sure it has its

623
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:57,940
roots from the Netherlands but uh so

624
00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:05,269
another strain that I really liked was

625
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:08,960
was it a k47 yeah that string grew

626
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:11,840
vigorously and in different systems that

627
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,690
you know it'll grow at different rates

628
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:17,809
but I had this an empty system that I

629
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:21,860
was using and they really thrived in

630
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:24,130
that system and literally a nutrient

631
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,130
film technique

632
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:31,108
and the buds that were coming off of

633
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:33,640
that plan was as large as your head

634
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:36,279
Christmas tree size like plants that

635
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:37,719
were you know eight feet tall six to

636
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,470
eight feet tall and where were you at

637
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:41,608
this point

638
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:41,608
that was when I was in Brooklyn

639
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:49,449
massive

640
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:51,219
I think you look a lot of those strains

641
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:53,199
like I told you I got from Amsterdam and

642
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:54,879
so some of those companies are still in

643
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,799
existence and some of those companies

644
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,980
that are still in existence still have

645
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,250
those strains but you know those things

646
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,539
develop over time

647
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,869
all right there is there any cause

648
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:09,869
because right now you're growing

649
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:14,139
basically hydroponically right and

650
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:18,130
you've also grown in soil so can you

651
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:19,839
talk about like same genetics that maybe

652
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,490
you've grown both different ways and

653
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,039
just some nuance differences that you've

654
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:27,849
seen I find they're growing in soil it

655
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:31,150
takes longer for the plants to develop

656
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:34,719
in a vegetative state I think that the

657
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:40,059
taste in the after product is better but

658
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:42,939
the the bottom line for me is production

659
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:45,960
and so the time yeah so the time

660
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:48,610
involved is always a factor for me and

661
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,740
if it doesn't fit within a time line

662
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:55,210
then it's not going to be something that

663
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:57,479
I'm going to consider so everything is

664
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:59,949
about kind of hard you know this like

665
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,139
marginal improvement in taste is that

666
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:05,598
lead to marginal per pound

667
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:09,078
you know I mean I get good results out

668
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,670
of the method that I use and and that's

669
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:15,528
been over trial and error and throughout

670
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:17,119
the years there are a lot of different

671
00:38:15,528 --> 00:38:19,338
ways to grow marijuana I would say

672
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:24,469
hundreds but maybe that's a stretch

673
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:27,978
but there are certainly a bunch of

674
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:32,929
different ways to grow marijuana and the

675
00:38:27,978 --> 00:38:34,788
variables then vary the medium that

676
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:37,308
you're growing how long you're going to

677
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:41,650
vegetate the nutrients that you use the

678
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:41,650
techniques that you use the light

679
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:49,940
spectrums that you use at different

680
00:38:44,748 --> 00:38:52,308
times all those are factors yes I'm kind

681
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:57,139
of your thought process of different

682
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:59,690
stages of growth the I guess the the

683
00:38:57,139 --> 00:39:02,538
plant in a vegetative state likes blue

684
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:06,969
light which is a metal halide and then

685
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:10,278
in the flowering stage likes a red light

686
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:14,239
the first couple of weeks in flowering

687
00:39:10,278 --> 00:39:17,420
your plant will start to stretch and

688
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:20,719
under a red light that stretching can be

689
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:24,559
significant so in a lot of times the

690
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:27,440
grower will use a metal halide for the

691
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,930
first two weeks of flowering to keep the

692
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,659
profile of his garden down and avoid

693
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:37,909
stretching so that's one technique some

694
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:41,159
people would use the plant needs the red

695
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:43,469
light to flower and

696
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:45,869
look there some people who use blue

697
00:39:43,469 --> 00:39:46,319
light to flower or a combination of the

698
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:49,889
two

699
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,680
I found that I get good results with the

700
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:56,549
genetics that I'm using out of using the

701
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:59,159
blue light in veg and the high pressure

702
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:03,530
sodium red light in the flowering stage

703
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:06,049
and I account for the stretching also

704
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:08,550
when you're growing different strains

705
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:11,300
they'll like different things and

706
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:18,030
they'll react differently to conditions

707
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:20,519
so the other aspect of that is that all

708
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:22,830
strains don't like the same mixture that

709
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:25,199
you're giving well so and in your ideal

710
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:26,960
world you have those each of those three

711
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:30,299
strains would be in different rooms

712
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:34,710
ideally and then I'd be able to tweak

713
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:38,370
their needs so with those three can you

714
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:39,960
talk about what each of them something

715
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,460
that each of them would like that's

716
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,050
different but you had to kind of

717
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,289
compromise and go kind of down the

718
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:48,990
middle it's hard to pinpoint exactly

719
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:54,110
what the needs are for the different

720
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:57,689
strains for instance the Sour Diesel

721
00:40:54,110 --> 00:41:03,860
doesn't like additives it likes a very

722
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:06,300
basic soup if you will nutrient mix the

723
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:09,030
formulas that I'm using right now that

724
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:14,310
strawberry-banana loves what I'm giving

725
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:20,060
it as does the wedding cake but the gas

726
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:20,059
leak it could use a little bit different

727
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:28,139
additive the list if you will not saying

728
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,920
that we need more probably needs less

729
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:30,920
less is more
