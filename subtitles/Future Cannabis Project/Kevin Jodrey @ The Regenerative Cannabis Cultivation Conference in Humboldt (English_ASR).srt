[Music]

2
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:18,028
fixing fucked up operations because I

3
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:19,769
could build it up and I could put the

4
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:21,420
genetics in it but I can tell you where

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,429
to sell it and I could get it to happen

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,560
and so people would have me come in and

7
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:28,349
just work on these giant fucking illegal

8
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,000
operations to modernize them and get him

9
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,618
up to the money they should be making

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,359
and then I didn't have to have the

11
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:37,350
infrastructure I can just get paid to

12
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:39,149
come in make money and then leave and it

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,870
was nice and I was a really good

14
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:46,439
consultant and I I had such a good life

15
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:48,238
because of it that I was like man this

16
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,128
is my thing I create a bill that grow I

17
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,519
do and then I get into legal cannabis

18
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:55,170
and I realized honestly that I was gonna

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,680
have to compete with eleven different

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,448
people people who build scenes people

21
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,649
that have PhD teams I'm like robots so

22
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:04,319
on son you get a laning I'm fucking with

23
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,728
you soil so your soil wizard but all of

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,959
a sudden they hire dr. Lane and all of a

25
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:09,450
sudden you're not as smart as you used

26
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,429
to be so I realized I'm not doctor oil

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,750
and I'm not the Dutch consulting company

28
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,700
because I'm not doing greenhouse ranges

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,099
up to a million square feet and I'm not

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,930
a lighting company and I'm not who I am

31
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:23,809
I oh I'm a from a fucking market

32
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:27,509
analysis so I kind of shifted out of

33
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:30,090
being specific on a thing that I used to

34
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,090
do and became specific on a thing that I

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,329
believed I could do really well that you

36
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,790
couldn't compete with me and using any

37
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:40,500
new technology or your PhD because you'd

38
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,750
have to have a fucking career hustle and

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,109
degree to get this one so I found out

40
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,090
where my lane was mm-hmm and I stayed

41
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:50,489
there and then I just make sure that I

42
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,280
detail detour off of it so I can go see

43
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,769
how do we still build how do we still

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,859
grow and I still grow and I still do all

45
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:01,679
this stuff but I don't delve into it so

46
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:04,609
deeply because I can mine the material

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:10,020
now to kind of like a micro

48
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:12,270
hit some cookies cookie said I use the

49
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,219
skills that I have which is I think I

50
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,830
think I've been historically accurate on

51
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,229
where the markets going with what they

52
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,290
use and the people that have worked with

53
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:23,699
me over time have made money and so you

54
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:25,379
kid that's how you measure your business

55
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:28,859
successes how much money did your

56
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,419
business make downstream a fuck what was

57
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,370
your real impact in in the in the

58
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:36,179
industry you were in it was fucking big

59
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:39,090
so therefore I know I must be on point

60
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,430
there you have to have an end game and

61
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,409
so for me I said I got you if we're

62
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,240
gonna get into this new industrial world

63
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:46,799
of cannabis and I saw this 11 12 years

64
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,950
ago if this is what the new world's

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,660
gonna look like in my opinion then let's

66
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:55,649
be real clear can you compete with the

67
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:56,879
PhD team for the Cornell no nope you're

68
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,490
not gonna fuck with people who study

69
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,069
into micro-moments they do take a lot of

70
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,980
that rule that get other Tiger shoes but

71
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:06,780
in that room they're deadly and so I

72
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,539
said I'll run I can't be those people I

73
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,640
can't be this person and I can't be that

74
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,560
person

75
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,599
I can only be that the person that I am

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,640
and I started to really take a look

77
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:19,549
honestly and determine who was that

78
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,769
person and what I said was I got you man

79
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,990
I got all these other skills but the

80
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:30,160
real skill is that I see the problem

81
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:32,420
and that I can chase the solution that

82
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,120
then it would allow me to make the

83
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:37,219
transition I needed and while I'm doing

84
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,870
it I'll build operations that let me

85
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:44,900
have an opportunity to make tangents so

86
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,640
you have to have more than one situation

87
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,020
because if you get screwed as a farmer

88
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,699
that means you failed well if you have a

89
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,730
store no you didn't fail you just you

90
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:54,349
just shrink down the farm and if the

91
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:57,199
store doesn't work then you can use the

92
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:59,180
farm and if you can use the nursery then

93
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,199
you still can succeed and if you can use

94
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,510
a mixed slider you can do the

95
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:05,769
distribution something you have to have

96
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:09,199
multiple permits in hand and I always

97
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:11,870
can it to your mechanic and all you have

98
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,238
is an adjustable wrench so it works

99
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,980
great until you get to a fucking allen

100
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,989
wrench and now you're not even in

101
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:19,939
mechanic work anymore so you have to

102
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:22,370
have a toolbox with enough tools to

103
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:23,870
handle enough basic stuff so that no

104
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,750
matter what problem you're working on

105
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:29,240
you have the tool needed to help you

106
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:32,509
solve the problem and because of that

107
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,370
you're no longer any of these people so

108
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:37,279
I'm someone who runs all these

109
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,949
operations but I'm I'm really not any of

110
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:43,399
them anymore I'm all of them and none of

111
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:45,860
them and for me what it is is it's a

112
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,049
survival technique of you better do all

113
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,460
of this stuff all the time continuously

114
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,040
to see the interrelationship between

115
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:54,469
them so you know how to move with this

116
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,270
thing because farmers are always like I

117
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,460
don't know what to do and the stores are

118
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:00,109
like I don't know what to do and the but

119
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:02,478
if you have all the pieces in front of

120
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,370
you you have a kind of decent idea of

121
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,939
how they work so you can better see what

122
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,978
to do and I wish I had a better plan

123
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:12,680
that was easier but it was a busy one I

124
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:14,930
mean I burned a lot of mental hours over

125
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,240
the LEAs years trying to figure out how

126
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,910
do you do it and then I just realized

127
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,720
that if I released the information as I

128
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:25,810
was doing it whether I was winning

129
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,190
it would let people benefit from it and

130
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,540
the people that would benefit would be

131
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:30,129
the people that were coming into the

132
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,990
industry that we're going to populate

133
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:34,629
the world around me so that when I was

134
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:37,090
in my 60s I had people that had been

135
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:39,310
brought in and had been able to get kind

136
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:42,310
of caught up and I got the info in this

137
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,839
manner this was how we behaved my

138
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,319
introduction of 2:15 is through like

139
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:51,250
Dennis Peron where I was early 215

140
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:53,230
individual and I realized when I looked

141
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,379
at what Dennis was doing I said wow he's

142
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,000
doing something so elegant because he's

143
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,339
helping people who don't have the

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,180
ability to help themselves and he's not

145
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:07,329
trying to gain some kind of fucking

146
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,280
social credit from it it's genuine and I

147
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:11,199
said that's possible I said if when I'm

148
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,759
in medical cannabis that's how I'll

149
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,680
behave when I'm in hustle cannabis I'll

150
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,539
do hustle cannabis but if it's medical

151
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,009
cannabis I'll make sure I copy somebody

152
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,379
that I respected because I thought it

153
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:22,930
was just such a kind human beautiful

154
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:25,629
thing to see so I thought that if I

155
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,100
could if I could succeed or I could

156
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:28,569
achieve and I was able to share the

157
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,910
information I was able to help people

158
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:32,800
out then what I would do is I would I

159
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,020
would recreate that same thing that

160
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,870
happened to me that somebody who I

161
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:40,359
didn't know did something in them I end

162
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,600
up getting to know him but when I

163
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,090
started it was not that it was really

164
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,340
just knowing that this was possible it

165
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:50,889
had been done and it had a huge impact

166
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:54,429
and so why couldn't I have that impact

167
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:57,550
why couldn't I also do something

168
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,019
beautiful and it adds a value to your

169
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,840
life that you just really can't

170
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:04,359
calculate because it's it's a human

171
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,279
thing and you have to you have to

172
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,889
understand that because at some point in

173
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:11,799
time you will become older and the

174
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:13,479
people who follow you you're basically

175
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,980
trying to create a link in a chain that

176
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,270
they can connect to and if it's a good

177
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,730
fucking link man they're gonna stay

178
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:22,180
connected and what happens is you end up

179
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,950
really changing a model and you end up

180
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,259
developing people that you never knew

181
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:29,229
while this dreams realize they were

182
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:31,300
going to be that's successful and you're

183
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,220
able to to be part of something that's

184
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,020
perpetual because you're the one that

185
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,350
lifts that fucking fire and put the wood

186
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:38,409
in the

187
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:42,310
and they baked that cake you part of

188
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:44,410
that process and I just I just believe

189
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,720
that that's the only way to survive this

190
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,820
shit I just didn't I sat down and

191
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,130
thought I mean I I'm pretty good with a

192
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:54,009
plan i sat down and I said I can't

193
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:56,170
outrun this problem I don't have enough

194
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:57,639
money for the next 60 years because I

195
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,490
was in my 40s then right so I'm like

196
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:04,029
look at 60 years worth of money no

197
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,800
that's a lot of fucking money and uh can

198
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:07,359
I make sixty years worth of money in a

199
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,400
decade because I figured in a decade the

200
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,230
game would be over and it was about 13

201
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:14,709
years so I was three years off on the

202
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:16,270
pace but I said no because any problem

203
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:18,459
that happens will take me right out and

204
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:19,899
if I get one legal case I'll go I'll go

205
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:21,219
blow a couple hundred grand to fight it

206
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,079
because you don't want to go to prison

207
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,220
to miss the game completely so therefore

208
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:27,310
how am I gonna do this and I'm gonna

209
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,170
need to have on the 11 million dollars

210
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,280
to last that long I said I'm gonna make

211
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,310
eleven million dollars over the next

212
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,649
year and Bank it no no not in what we're

213
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:37,389
doing unless we go so huge that we put

214
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,728
ourselves in this unbelievably risky

215
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:42,009
position and so I just said I can't

216
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:45,460
outrun the problem so I said I'm just

217
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:48,669
gonna figure out how to how to change

218
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,560
and go into the future and I said I'll

219
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:52,689
just use the skill sets but what I'll do

220
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,059
is I'll bring with me some stuff that I

221
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,460
think was important so that the people

222
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:59,559
that follow me they didn't have to get

223
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,910
fucked around I didn't have to you got

224
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:02,259
to pay your dues and I'm like you want

225
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:02,879
pay you do his means to be fucking be

226
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:05,649
polite

227
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,970
basically the other said why did you

228
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:09,789
give him that plant I said cuz he was

229
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:12,610
polite and he asked nicely and they

230
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:13,959
wanted it for to succeed yeah but

231
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,039
they're gonna use it make money exactly

232
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,170
that was that's what I hope they do with

233
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,659
it because otherwise they don't have any

234
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:21,189
money and for you you having money and

235
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,779
them not having money is some kind of

236
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,740
form of success of safety but it's the

237
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:29,769
opposite everyone around you paid is a

238
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,110
much better life this I know when all

239
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,879
your friends have money you all are

240
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,310
living better all your kids do better

241
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:37,840
your grandkids do better the neighbors

242
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,669
do better because there's a higher level

243
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,250
of charity when blue-collar people have

244
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:44,529
money and I learned that from career

245
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,929
dope game that the best charity I have a

246
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:47,959
saw was from people who really were

247
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:49,669
getting paid

248
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:54,710
more than they deserved as far as

249
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:55,819
society was concerned yeah way nicer and

250
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,560
the people who got all the money that

251
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,450
society said should have it didn't share

252
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,009
much they share when they're old and

253
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,980
they give away a stipend to some

254
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:06,409
organization we did grassroots work and

255
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,800
it created a way way better lifestyle

256
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:12,110
for all of us in a sense that I've never

257
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:14,299
locked my door at my house I don't have

258
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,620
fucking house keys I have keys and shit

259
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:17,629
for everything else I touch but I got

260
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,399
out I'd never locked my fucking door I

261
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:20,659
locked my living room at night because

262
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,350
my daughter likes to sleep on the couch

263
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:23,029
now right

264
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,310
so I lock the door because I'm afraid

265
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:27,139
someone gonna steal my kid but I don't

266
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:29,269
lock the back door I just lock the one

267
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:31,100
next to her but I've never locked it

268
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:33,590
with the key I don't have house keys

269
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:37,250
because no no's ever robbed in our

270
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,930
houses you know it used to be golden in

271
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,120
that form and and you know things are

272
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:43,849
changing in the in the economy and in

273
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,370
regions but man I got to see this

274
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,840
incredible thing in person and I said

275
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,210
listen I said I'm gonna try to bring

276
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,220
that forward with me into this new world

277
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,350
of cannabis and now we're into this

278
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,019
world of cannabis and this one's a

279
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,540
strange one because everybody that comes

280
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:02,539
to me now I'm good at picking it up I'm

281
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:05,599
good at picking up what your intent is

282
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:07,069
and so everybody think they clever and

283
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,409
they come and ask you questions but I

284
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:15,470
can tell by the question you ask what

285
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:17,719
you're trying to get seen like since

286
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,370
legalization the economy and Humboldt

287
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,840
has been hurting like local businesses

288
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,769
lose two-thirds of their revenue that's

289
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,850
real and what do you think like what do

290
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:27,259
you think about that and do you think

291
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,790
what are you trying to create here with

292
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:31,909
what you're doing you're giving people

293
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:33,409
food I mean I don't know this is a team

294
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:36,079
effort but you were here put setting up

295
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:36,980
chairs you know and you believe this is

296
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,160
something that people are coming from

297
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,930
all over the world to experience and you

298
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,110
know woody what do you hope what do you

299
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:47,239
see how do you see that correcting well

300
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,120
the first father question is economy's

301
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,680
getting hammered but so much of it is

302
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,139
because the individuals that were here

303
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,909
that we're able to support local stores

304
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:57,860
are having terrible problems getting

305
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:59,689
licensed and by the time you're done

306
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,970
with licensing you're financially broke

307
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,649
and

308
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,410
it's tough and people in the mainstream

309
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:06,909
don't understand that the level of

310
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:08,409
problem because to them to get a

311
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:09,309
business license is cheap and you just

312
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:11,649
do some simple shit

313
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:14,289
but tell me you want to start a you know

314
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:16,330
a chemical reclamation lab and now

315
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:19,088
you're gonna have a tremendous amount of

316
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:21,459
hearings and you're gonna have all kinds

317
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:22,779
of zoning well that's all of us that

318
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,799
we're in the industry is all of a sudden

319
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:26,799
we're finding we don't have the

320
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:28,870
abilities and tools so you wiping out

321
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,639
the local monies which then make the

322
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,990
stores have no longer people can shop

323
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,659
and because we don't have enough

324
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,610
population here as a total it impacts

325
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:38,500
them greatly

326
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:41,889
this situation is I didn't put this on

327
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,360
not I I was honored to be asked to be

328
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:45,970
part of it and I even told them I don't

329
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,430
think I'm qualified because I'm not a

330
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,769
regenerative wizard like I understand

331
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:52,719
the concept but I am definitely a junior

332
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:56,139
high school student in a room full of

333
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,490
PhDs but they said hey that's not why

334
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:01,059
we're asking you what we're asking you

335
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:03,250
to do is do lecture on marketing on

336
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:05,139
genetic choices how do you classify

337
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,759
cannabis how do you put it into

338
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:08,019
categories so that you're able to

339
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:10,600
actually have product differentiation

340
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:12,220
and then could you bring in all the

341
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,470
genomic people you work with all over

342
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,970
the all over the world so that you can

343
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,120
interview them so that people can start

344
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,769
to see how they gut their creativity

345
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,740
what drives on what directions are they

346
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:25,809
going and I said hey I'm down I can do

347
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,459
that so I get to be part of an

348
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:30,549
incredible event where what you're

349
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:32,859
seeing is how do you create a craft

350
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:34,740
model because cannabis to me right now

351
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,750
is all the same shit thrown in a box

352
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,370
without without the mega operations you

353
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,200
can't have craft because they're

354
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,778
comparison contrast you can't have love

355
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,910
without hate otherwise it did their book

356
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:48,639
their book ends so without one there

357
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,958
isn't another it can't be all one thing

358
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,789
or it would just be wouldn't be called

359
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,458
to be called a normal so it would be a

360
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:56,409
thing we define it we instantly limit it

361
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,778
well when you start to have commercial

362
00:13:56,409 --> 00:14:00,730
then you have to have craft because you

363
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:03,189
have a clear differentiation of what is

364
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,980
craft and these are the models that

365
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,390
really are gonna work and and for the

366
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,970
first time you know you're really

367
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:12,730
getting an incredible cross-section of

368
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,230
the population to come in where it's all

369
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,149
these individuals that are

370
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,970
biologically-based but they're all

371
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:22,090
getting together to share info share the

372
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:26,139
experience to question and argue out

373
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:28,149
fine details of accuracy and I think

374
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:31,600
what happens is it allows you to start

375
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:32,799
to be able to get groups together in the

376
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,019
room there's almost 200 people sitting

377
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,349
there it lets you get together and then

378
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:41,309
now you have community as cultivators

379
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:44,680
that lets you start to have a voice and

380
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:48,399
we know the products better but the the

381
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:50,379
main point the main point is that the

382
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,669
cultivators start to see each other they

383
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:53,590
start to be able to share this

384
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:56,769
information you start to be able to

385
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:58,180
create a true culture that then makes an

386
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:00,669
attraction for other people to want to

387
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:03,189
participate and the customer starts to

388
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:06,370
be able to have a chance to pick up

389
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:08,770
product so say say 20 these farms run

390
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,480
similar material it allows them to have

391
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:13,449
similar material throughout the entire

392
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,670
fiscal year all of it done probiotic lis

393
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:18,700
all of it done regenerative orbit Doug

394
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:20,799
sees me in an organic methodology so the

395
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:24,220
customer gets to have killer shit all

396
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:26,049
the time and it allows all of us to move

397
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,389
forward so you may not have an ability

398
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:30,579
to put enough product that you made to

399
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:34,090
cover entire year's worth of sales on a

400
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:36,730
quick pace but together as a group we do

401
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:38,700
and then that lets the mainstream start

402
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:41,289
to experience these type of products

403
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,570
consistently and it's the consistent

404
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:45,699
exposure that gets them to want to do it

405
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,790
because pretty soon you just say hey

406
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,560
that shit's better and I'm gonna go find

407
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:53,139
it and if it's available and it's

408
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,489
convenient then it's an easy sale and if

409
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:56,080
you make it to where there's only X

410
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,029
amount that comes out all year you have

411
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,470
to make them remember you and how do you

412
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:01,120
make them remember you when you don't

413
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,100
have a marketing budget big enough to

414
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,440
sink an ad through the nine months

415
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,420
you're not selling herb so you have to

416
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,430
have other people succeeding using the

417
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:10,839
same methodology so that people start to

418
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:13,509
become comfortable with sun-grown

419
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,090
biologically-based sustainable

420
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:18,299
cultivation and you're not trying to tax

421
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,530
them excessively for that privilege

422
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:22,689
you're trying to give it to him at the

423
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:24,789
fairest price you can so that what

424
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,490
happens is there's actually a

425
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:28,240
competition that's possible because if

426
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,519
you try to make a

427
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,230
pay too much money you start to make

428
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,799
people feel that they're getting peeled

429
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:37,720
and it's easier to not go that route

430
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:40,659
it's easier to make it competitive and

431
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,910
then get to share and then you're able

432
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:45,490
to start educating the public because

433
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:46,808
they're then curious because why they

434
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,159
want to know why they like your product

435
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:49,958
but if you're trying to tell them this

436
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,338
is why you should like it they want to

437
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:53,678
argue because people don't like to be

438
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:55,449
told what to do and so you have to be

439
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:58,360
really intelligent with how you approach

440
00:16:55,448 --> 00:17:01,719
this because fundamentally we as career

441
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,850
smokers know that bio pot is better and

442
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,189
as somebody who's environmentally

443
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,599
conscious we know that it's better but

444
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:10,360
the question is how do you get the

445
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:13,568
mainstream to understand it and it has

446
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:16,359
to be through exposure and then exposure

447
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:18,788
lets them get in get access access gives

448
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,369
enjoyment enjoyment gives curiosity as

449
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:22,808
to why and now you get education but

450
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:26,398
people want to educate well who the fuck

451
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:29,139
wants who wants to know what's the point

452
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:30,819
educationally comes from desire and so

453
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,470
you got to give them the desire then

454
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:34,538
you'll get the education and then you'll

455
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,819
start to have the loop where you start

456
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:40,298
to have individuals who only buy these

457
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:43,319
kind of products the desire because what

458
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:43,319
you're giving them is a better product

459
00:17:44,548 --> 00:17:48,548
because what you're what you're gonna do

460
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:50,649
is you're gonna be able to we're going

461
00:17:48,548 --> 00:17:53,619
to put products on the table and so what

462
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:56,558
I know is a good example is Las Vegas so

463
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:58,750
where Las Vegas is a gressive model but

464
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,369
but my friend Steve Cantwell has got a

465
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,528
successful business doing the no-till

466
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:04,119
indoor so he used an indoor model cuz

467
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:06,548
it's too hot in the desert but his

468
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:09,038
flower is better than the chem driven

469
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:10,839
flower and he's pricing it at a fair

470
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,000
price so that this way what it is is a

471
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,740
choice once you consume it there's no

472
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,898
way you can deny that it's not a better

473
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,140
product and then you go whoa that was

474
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:21,519
really good product and then you go seek

475
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,690
it out again and then you say well you

476
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:24,819
know what let me go try something else

477
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:26,890
and you go hey that's flavorless let me

478
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:28,178
go back to his stuff it's rich let me go

479
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,159
try something else it's flavorless let

480
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:32,890
me go buy fish it's rich and all of a

481
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:35,679
sudden it becomes apparent and and if

482
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:37,659
you're able to work in this direction

483
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,399
where for Steve because he was the first

484
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:41,210
and he's running it but now this other

485
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:42,319
no-till people pretty

486
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,420
you can have people come into

487
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,039
dispensaries and say I'd like to get

488
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,380
note if you guys get in door you got any

489
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:50,960
no-till indoor do you have any farms

490
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,490
that are tied into the DM Network do you

491
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,110
have any farms that are that are known

492
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,880
for regenerative you have farmers have

493
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:57,919
been known for biologically based stuff

494
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,840
you got Sun grown out of the out of the

495
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,130
Sierras you got Sun grown out of Mendo

496
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,799
you got some killer Sun grow out of

497
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,320
Humboldt what do you got from that thing

498
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:09,049
because they know from experiencing it

499
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,789
that's what they liked but the only way

500
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:13,399
to do that is to get enough product on

501
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:15,170
the table to make it happen and the only

502
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,050
way it could happen for us as smaller

503
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:21,380
canopy guys is if you're working in this

504
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:23,359
this collective model and and I the

505
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,860
words the words become their own word

506
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,909
we're all of a sudden everyone sees

507
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:27,349
collective and they're like all the fuck

508
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,600
we're all tied together but it just

509
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:32,719
means we're all in the same production

510
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,819
methodologies and we're able to create a

511
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,259
situation that benefits all of us

512
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:37,909
because when I buy you're proud of that

513
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:40,089
go oh this is good product

514
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,350
it lets me want to try his product and

515
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:44,569
when I try his practical hey this simply

516
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:48,230
sun-grown product - and in a minute

517
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:50,179
you'll be able to see the this clearly

518
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,460
because when you start to have education

519
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:55,279
like this you start to be able to get

520
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,829
your inputs down to where 60% of less

521
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,740
cost to grow the product that's six

522
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:02,569
that's that's a lot of money so if it

523
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,210
took you a hundred dollars to grow your

524
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:08,299
pound and it took me 40 dollars to grow

525
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,579
mine I can literally take that 60 bucks

526
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:13,369
that I saved and take it off of my top

527
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:15,740
end still make the same margin still

528
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:17,750
make the same profit but I'm out

529
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,819
competing you through efficiency and

530
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,019
that's what these larger operations are

531
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,089
trying to do is they're going to try to

532
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,349
come at us with efficiency but they're

533
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:27,829
going to come at us with efficiency

534
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:30,259
through shitty products and that's the

535
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:32,990
problem is that there's they're they're

536
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:35,569
going to have a ocean of this coming out

537
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,930
but ultimately for people who consume

538
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:41,629
cannabis if you give them the chance to

539
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:43,310
experience good herb they remember it

540
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,660
and when they smoke other herb they

541
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:47,179
don't like it they remember I didn't

542
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,040
like it and so I think that these events

543
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:52,220
get the people together so that you

544
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,740
unitize a production style in a cultural

545
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,929
style but

546
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,120
you're you're able to start also getting

547
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:01,340
enough people together to where you can

548
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:05,058
have events you can have meetings you

549
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:07,759
can have Pharma yep anything that lets

550
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:10,639
you have access to the public things

551
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,440
that start to do grade grading to where

552
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,788
people can start to understand what are

553
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,080
the different grades of cannabis because

554
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:16,908
all of a sudden the information is going

555
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:19,819
to want to be there because the people

556
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:22,429
are going to be into it without the

557
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:24,648
stigma all of a sudden you're free to

558
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:26,630
learn as you choose and so the

559
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:28,038
mainstream people didn't want to get so

560
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,630
caught up in it because they like look

561
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:32,028
we can't celebrate our love a weed

562
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:34,340
because it'll fuck up our lives but now

563
00:21:32,028 --> 00:21:36,710
it has no impact in that form so they

564
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:38,178
can also now do their thing and so the

565
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,130
gardens you're gonna see some housewives

566
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:41,509
that have been growing marigolds that

567
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,980
are going to punch out some cannabis out

568
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:45,710
of their organic back y'all just gonna

569
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,899
blow your mind in a minute now they can

570
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:50,179
only grow six you know in an illegal but

571
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:54,139
you're gonna see to me a radical change

572
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:55,970
in the appreciation of the product once

573
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,820
people get a chance to really check it

574
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,950
out and hopefully you know that that

575
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:02,629
drives people into Humboldt County and

576
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,149
places like this Richardson Grove where

577
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:08,630
they go camp and then from here you can

578
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:10,939
have some farm touring you can have meet

579
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,620
the farmer events you can have people

580
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,330
get exposed the cannabis from people who

581
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:16,129
career who do it you can have seminars

582
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:18,678
like this but you just turn the volume

583
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,720
down a little I mean and you don't go so

584
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,548
deep into the science you go into an

585
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,038
introductory level and then you could

586
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:27,019
have courses like this for people who

587
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,509
were more advanced but for the general

588
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:31,490
public you make it you make it easy so

589
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:33,379
they can you can learn some fundamentals

590
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,808
about what it is they're consuming why

591
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,000
they consume it why they like it what

592
00:22:35,808 --> 00:22:40,519
what is these constituents you bring in

593
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,589
people that can explain these things

594
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:44,028
have these effects on you that's why so

595
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:46,459
they start to know why they like what

596
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:48,288
they like you get cannabinoid experts to

597
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,890
come in explain to them why these ratios

598
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:54,230
seem to work well for you why you need

599
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,929
to be aware of some of these things and

600
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,190
how some of these things don't matter

601
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:00,320
because this information most of it

602
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,269
isn't out what you have is you have

603
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,669
information that's used is basically

604
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:06,500
marketing it's kind of like

605
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,580
old high times because I've read this

606
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,430
shit in years it's like reading high

607
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:13,250
times and every article was basically to

608
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,660
sell the material on the next page so

609
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,579
they're not giving you any information

610
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,519
they giving you a marketing pitch

611
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:20,960
wrapped around some photos so the

612
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,869
problem is you're not really getting

613
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,240
true info you're getting marketing and

614
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:28,219
what people need is true info because

615
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,990
that's what's going to resonate and I

616
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,870
think in these could this kind of

617
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:35,390
community that's what you get and when

618
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:37,849
people come to hang out and experience

619
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,680
that type of situation their their

620
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:41,539
educational level skyrockets and their

621
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,720
appreciation of cannabis culture

622
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:47,059
skyrockets and it means if they'll take

623
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,680
the time to ask the person at the

624
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:52,519
counter would you direct me into

625
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:54,830
something like this because the person

626
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:56,930
at the counter who's the lowest paid

627
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:58,669
person in the dispensary is the

628
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,070
gatekeeper to every one of your farm

629
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,360
successes and people treat that person

630
00:24:01,069 --> 00:24:04,069
like shit and everybody always wants to

631
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:05,479
say they're undereducated they don't

632
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:08,929
know how to appreciate my shit and I'm

633
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,509
like no you're not making it easy for

634
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:13,610
them to sell your shit they don't need

635
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:15,379
to have this ungodly education on

636
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:16,819
cannabis that you do because you used to

637
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,800
get paid 400 thousand a year to have

638
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:21,619
that education they get paid 15 an hour

639
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,750
so you're you're you're believing that

640
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:25,939
they should have the same motivation you

641
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,279
do because you made eight times their

642
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,620
fucking paycheck well it doesn't work

643
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:34,009
like that these people are coming in for

644
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:36,829
jobs and they want to do a good job but

645
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:39,259
they're under an unbelievable amount of

646
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:42,619
pressure from customers to make choices

647
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:45,980
and how could you possibly know the

648
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:47,539
product from 400 farms well and then

649
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,650
know everything that's coming out and

650
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:49,909
know everything about cannabinoids

651
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,050
everything about terpenoids and about

652
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,600
the you know relax it just it's

653
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:57,169
impossible for someone at that price

654
00:24:53,599 --> 00:25:00,490
level of pay to have invested that much

655
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,490
time in cannabis science

656
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,538
maybe pluma but the what he does know is

657
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,118
where the plumbing material is located

658
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:12,798
and he knows enough to help you

659
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:15,079
understand hey when people come in they

660
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,749
seem to buy this so when I go into

661
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:19,579
dispensaries I'll go I'll go talk to the

662
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:21,618
/ if I even shop at a dispensary I'll go

663
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:24,589
ask the person at the dispensary all

664
00:25:21,618 --> 00:25:26,538
right I'm looking at 300 choices you

665
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:28,098
know what give me something gassy right

666
00:25:26,538 --> 00:25:29,749
and then give me something fruity and

667
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:33,048
then give me something that you like

668
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:35,329
yourself what are you into and they got

669
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:36,888
art well this one right here seems to be

670
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:38,388
moving with a lot of good feedback so

671
00:25:36,888 --> 00:25:39,949
here's your gas see when we got a good

672
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:42,168
goodness at that time it was a faceoff

673
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,940
ogi boy and then we got some kill a

674
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:45,710
cherry pie that was done out of this or

675
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,830
this organic farm out of the sea out of

676
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:51,200
this place it was nasty he goes but I

677
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:53,538
like this weird shit where it has this

678
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,149
crazy spicy tone that gives you this

679
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:58,908
really interesting hi I said boom I'll

680
00:25:56,148 --> 00:26:00,978
try that because it gives them things

681
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:02,809
that are moving through observation and

682
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:04,519
then what's his favorite based off of

683
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:04,999
what he likes or then in her case it was

684
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,878
a girl

685
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:10,038
and it allows you to be able to go and

686
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:14,178
make quick decisions but it also cuts

687
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:16,519
out 397 choices quickly and so how do

688
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:18,349
those how did those things work the

689
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:19,038
person who brought in the thing that was

690
00:26:18,348 --> 00:26:20,769
interesting

691
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,179
must have introduced it to the budtender

692
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:24,829
so somehow they got exposed to your

693
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:26,989
product in a really nice way they don't

694
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:29,210
need the Hat in the t-shirt they need to

695
00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:31,038
smoke the weed they need a dis

696
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,058
experience the pot they needed to be

697
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,669
able to say well that is some

698
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:35,839
interesting pot and now they can say to

699
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:37,519
their friends man this was some

700
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,709
interesting stuff and when I smoked it I

701
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,808
really enjoyed it I would recommend it

702
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:45,319
to people who wanted this well all of a

703
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:47,569
sudden you are an ungodly powerhouse in

704
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:48,950
that dispensary as a farm because the

705
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:52,538
people at the counter removing your

706
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:55,519
products there's no other way to do it

707
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:58,210
it has to be through they always say you

708
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:02,118
know budtender now they're calling um

709
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:03,950
consultants blood consultants but it has

710
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:06,829
to be through that person that does the

711
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:09,739
retail they have to be aware of the

712
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:11,509
products that you're presenting and if

713
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:13,129
you can start to put together these

714
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:14,620
organic groups where they get to

715
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:16,149
experience enough of it

716
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:17,979
enough directions of varieties pretty

717
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:21,480
soon they start to realize that's a

718
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:24,849
whole genre higher grown higher grade

719
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:28,779
bio pot and now you start to have

720
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:30,909
tenders who are aficionados or they

721
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:32,740
start appreciating your product and now

722
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,970
they start to push the product because

723
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,200
they start to they know that that's

724
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,819
better product and they know that the

725
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,160
people they push it to will be happy and

726
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:43,569
as long as you don't tax the shit out of

727
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:46,210
them with too much premium for all the

728
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:48,159
extra work I do because now all of a

729
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:51,220
sudden it correct it comes back to

730
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,960
competitiveness financially that only

731
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,700
works in some very specific upscale

732
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,250
markets so if you're not in Beverly

733
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,049
Hills and in Madison Ave you might not

734
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,670
want to go to this upper echelon so you

735
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:03,069
might want to go to more realistic and

736
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,750
realize that people who have jobs that

737
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:06,339
want to smoke good grass will pay an

738
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:19,299
extra five bucks but they won't pay an

739
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:22,599
extra twenty five bucks yeah yeah run

740
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:25,359
runs away and you need velocity you need

741
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:28,539
money to return and cannabis has a shelf

742
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:30,399
life it is not a widget so the the the

743
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:32,889
product that didn't move quickly

744
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:38,830
degrades and then when people consume it

745
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:41,500
it turns them off and the problem and

746
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:43,689
the problem the problem with that is

747
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,450
that now your label is attached to a

748
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:47,710
failure when really it's just happens

749
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,539
but people go oh my god I didn't like

750
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,009
that Proctor I'll try that one again and

751
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:52,058
what they really didn't understand was

752
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:53,859
it might have been the best product they

753
00:28:52,058 --> 00:28:56,289
have smoked except that it was packaged

754
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:57,759
eight months ago and so you've got

755
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:59,950
something that was eight months old that

756
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,500
had been sitting in a warm distributed

757
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,360
distribution warehouse and now your

758
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,000
products shot so what are you gonna do

759
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:08,979
with it and you look bad and people

760
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,839
don't to touch it and a lot of it is

761
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,750
that's why it has to be in clusters like

762
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:15,459
this where you move your stuff in in a

763
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,500
in a form where you're not competing

764
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,610
with the other farmers meaning that

765
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,289
you're doing good product

766
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:21,959
differentiation and you're making

767
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:24,609
intelligent choices to what you're doing

768
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,940
all of you aren't running the same thing

769
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:28,658
if it's trendy don't all run it make

770
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,070
sure that you

771
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:32,200
you're out who has the ability to run

772
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:34,479
the trendies who has the ability to run

773
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,249
the bulks and but it's all one too

774
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:38,830
similar production methodology so it's

775
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:40,598
ok fun it's all under similar

776
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:43,689
methodologies and so what you have is

777
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:46,358
you have that as a mantra and people

778
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,788
start to become aware of it and you

779
00:29:46,358 --> 00:29:50,558
start to be able to develop it the only

780
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:52,179
way that you can do this stuff is to get

781
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:53,470
it in people's faces like eight times

782
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:55,389
you want to hear radio ass gonna be like

783
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,210
eight times if I hear radio at eight

784
00:29:55,388 --> 00:30:00,308
times I hear it well how do you hear

785
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,889
sun-grown eight times is if you have

786
00:30:00,308 --> 00:30:04,388
eight people spitting it because it's

787
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:05,138
too hard for you to be in eight rooms

788
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:07,238
all the time

789
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:10,269
talking about it and so you have to have

790
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:15,669
many people hello

791
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:20,679
oh no microphone what's that get on a

792
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:22,989
microphone see they're filming what am I

793
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:25,599
talking about we're talking about the

794
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:34,899
problems in business when you're trying

795
00:30:25,598 --> 00:30:36,638
to develop a new industry and I think

796
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:38,469
that's the way because I don't think any

797
00:30:36,638 --> 00:30:40,178
of us have the the marketing budget I

798
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:44,679
don't think any of us have the

799
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:46,929
advertising budget I mean I spent a lot

800
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,909
of time and money advertising and

801
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:51,369
marketing products for my company

802
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:52,749
because we had the money when when we

803
00:30:51,368 --> 00:30:54,788
were in a situation where you were

804
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:56,739
making enough to do we played the game

805
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:59,079
to the best degree we could so we could

806
00:30:56,739 --> 00:31:00,308
understand the truth of it and so when I

807
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:01,538
tell people I said I'm telling you man

808
00:31:00,308 --> 00:31:03,548
you got to get yourself out there so

809
00:31:01,538 --> 00:31:05,440
hard that it basically resonates in

810
00:31:03,548 --> 00:31:08,470
their ears then they'll listen

811
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,200
otherwise you're invisible and and

812
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,940
that's why I like this event and and and

813
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,278
the one in Canada that I was a crier

814
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,109
because I couldn't believe the the

815
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:20,348
people that came to the event and how

816
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:21,970
dedicated they were to moving forward in

817
00:31:20,348 --> 00:31:24,548
these methodologies and it made me

818
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,470
realize that we really were developing a

819
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:29,679
new culture of cannabis production

820
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:32,288
because we could actually get together

821
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,609
without having a RICO Act follow us you

822
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:35,618
weren't gonna get a RICO Act case you

823
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:38,049
weren't in collusion as long as we don't

824
00:31:35,618 --> 00:31:40,240
set prices together

825
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:41,440
yeah and Lowe's we don't know there's a

826
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,690
few things there's a few little things

827
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,960
that we just don't do we can actually

828
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:49,059
figure this out together and you don't

829
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,789
have to be everybody you just have to be

830
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:53,259
you so you don't have to be late you

831
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:55,119
don't have to understand how to extract

832
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:57,400
fulvic acid you can have them and tell

833
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,929
you how to do it and you don't have to

834
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,240
be Alain and spend you know 50 years

835
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,980
under a microscope you can you can have

836
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,359
her disciples come and say listen can I

837
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,730
have you to come and scope my shit and

838
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:09,579
teach me how to do this so I know what

839
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:12,460
I'm looking at and all of a sudden you

840
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:14,859
know you're able to really stay alive in

841
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:17,049
my position I just I get people with

842
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:19,059
advice on how to kind of classify your

843
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:21,399
genetic library how do you put together

844
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:22,869
a library and how do you make sure that

845
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,300
you're catching the markets that you're

846
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:28,000
supposed to be catching based off of how

847
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:30,399
people perceive cannabis and if you can

848
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,589
understand that picture then it lets you

849
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,620
understand how not to weigh all your

850
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:37,419
choices in one basket because all you

851
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:42,250
have to do is have one problem and your

852
00:32:37,420 --> 00:33:00,220
basket falls out so I think we're off

853
00:32:42,250 --> 00:33:02,200
that we all made choices to not play the

854
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,880
conventional game and because of it we

855
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,620
all had to kind of work together and

856
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,510
none of us really cheat each other too

857
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:09,819
bad because we could fuck each other's

858
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:11,079
lives up so we didn't have and we had to

859
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:12,429
trust each other enough cuz sometimes

860
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:14,230
you know you're the one who has the

861
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:16,840
connect and so you're the one who's

862
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:18,039
moving he's moving the backs we don't

863
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:19,449
get along at all fucking ate each other

864
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:21,589
really

865
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,940
I'm moving a bunch of work and I know

866
00:33:21,589 --> 00:33:24,470
you've got a bunch of work and I need

867
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,150
that work and I know you need to move so

868
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,610
let's just do the work shit if you'll be

869
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:31,670
like I'm not this time of the year that

870
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:33,019
was real life and that used to happen so

871
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:35,480
people you didn't get along with you

872
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:36,319
still move the work because you didn't

873
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,470
need to get warm

874
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:45,439
you needed to survive I still see the

875
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:47,720
same way we can build a future to make

876
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,400
it company we can build a future I don't

877
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,670
I don't see us happen to be poverty

878
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,620
stricken if we walk-in away from that

879
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:57,160
yes yes there is abundance just what you

880
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:57,159
got to do is you

881
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:24,359
