[Music]

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:11,490
have any wood chip shot oh yeah you know

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,400
like here's my road slide here's my road

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,399
slide which is relevant is some IMO so

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,480
I'm like there's my road sliding out you

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:24,750
know there's like my road okay so look

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,390
I'm like I reach down oh that's nice

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:33,450
you know so I was like oh bring that

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:45,179
back with me and something but wood

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:47,250
chips jLF that's gonna be like plant

11
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,500
food that's all

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,628
that's like all gonna be plant food you

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,929
know basically just stems and leaves

14
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:56,488
nothing fucking fancy and all its you

15
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,619
know but I was gonna make a liquid plant

16
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:00,419
food out of it so that's the beauty of

17
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,698
that that's kind of what I was the point

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,118
I was trying to make earlier it's for

19
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:08,039
when you intentionally do an anaerobic

20
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,280
jLF where you are putting this stuff in

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,780
a barrel culturing it anaerobically

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,359
speeding up the breakdown process

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,820
instead of nature taking a year having

24
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,159
to put it into a hugo bed so that nature

25
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,048
can break it down or you know whether

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,700
you leave it outside let nature do it

27
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,340
whatever time

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,618
that's that takes time if you you put it

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,109
in a barrel and you go anaerobic on that

30
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:32,780
it breaks it down in like two weeks it

31
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:35,390
shit's like gone

32
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,950
you know what I mean it's like mush it's

33
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:41,629
like and it's like lick and it's

34
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:44,930
available and the bacteria that the

35
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:48,228
plant wants are right there you know it

36
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:50,890
cultures those specific bacteria so

37
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:53,950
therefore you're out competing out

38
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:57,099
competing anything that's not beneficial

39
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:00,109
that's not that's not welcoming because

40
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:03,109
it's not there it shouldn't be there so

41
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:05,539
whatever's there is beneficial so if

42
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:09,139
you're just focusing on not bringing

43
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:10,939
outside things in and well I mean even

44
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,379
though I am doing well woodchips in my

45
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:14,719
environment there's there's trees

46
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:18,169
everywhere so woodchips you legit you

47
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:21,830
know I'm trying to like you know mimic

48
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:24,109
nature you know but you know but that's

49
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,370
more of an intentional anaerobic process

50
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,370
process you know

51
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:37,169
I almost wanted to jLF wood chips I was

52
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:41,580
gonna like like doing anaerobic wood

53
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:44,189
chip actually I am because some of the I

54
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,380
have thrown some of my mulch in there

55
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:48,939
which has wood chips but I'm not really

56
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,859
going for

57
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:52,389
I should do wood chips and see what they

58
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,680
do

59
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:57,250
I don't know what do you got on with

60
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,520
chips

61
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:05,169
I got wood chips this when I was looking

62
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:07,900
at these are some piles though yeah that

63
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:09,869
we're oh but I did what I was going to

64
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:14,039
show you what I originally pulled up was

65
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,039
you know some of the starting material

66
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:31,860
which like this right here you're

67
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:31,860
chipping that he's chipping like this

68
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:45,459
this one right here is a rental

69
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:50,289
hi I have an 8 inch chipper which could

70
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:52,060
chip something that size but we use a 12

71
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:53,828
inch chipper when we're gonna chip this

72
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,310
like we're trimming hundreds of yards

73
00:03:53,829 --> 00:04:00,310
away I so watch I think about chippers

74
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:03,759
all the time I want one so bad yeah so

75
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:07,299
this is what I know oh yeah it's just

76
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:12,280
that thing now this is this is right

77
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:15,658
here this this is I have no idea how old

78
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,658
it is but it's

79
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,620
what I guess I'm saying I know that it's

80
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,319
been sitting in this pile for twenty

81
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,569
years but I don't know if it was already

82
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,449
starting to break down but what's going

83
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:31,819
on here is just some really broken down

84
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:34,908
/ but this is actually straight off of

85
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:37,560
oh right on

86
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:43,348
straight off the law baby

87
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:47,129
straight off yes so we got like like

88
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:50,878
this pile here I guess it's it's

89
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:55,560
predominantly like woodchips and worm

90
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:58,639
castings and that wisteria

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,829
hundred-year-old wisteria tan oak leaves

92
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,538
grasses from weed-whacking I mean like

93
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:06,209
anything that looks good

94
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:09,870
wood without like raping you know kind

95
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:11,218
of it's easy to like do the IMO it's a

96
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,968
sensitive thing you know anyone like

97
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:17,759
over harvest like like the IMO and in

98
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:19,769
the forest you know it's like mining it

99
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,229
so you really do want to be like really

100
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:27,149
gentle with it and then and then grow it

101
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:29,128
in wood chips okay so this is actually

102
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:34,469
something like I go down this road a lot

103
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:35,750
so the the ethics of using stuff we have

104
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:55,130
[Music]

105
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:57,680
on our property sorry but oh yeah stuff

106
00:05:55,129 --> 00:06:00,680
out it's very obvious for the stuff that

107
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,069
needs to be pulled out but then at what

108
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,079
point does that go into its own way of

109
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:07,939
forest management so it's live on the

110
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,149
forest floor but it's helping to build

111
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:13,100
soil for the forest by being there and I

112
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:14,229
pull it out a Chapman and juice it in my

113
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:20,140
garden

114
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:20,140
am i damaging the forest that being said

115
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,730
they're not using it for commercial

116
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:32,060
production well that's why yeah once you

117
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:34,970
start reaching that if you you start

118
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,850
questioning your own practices you

119
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:40,460
really need to start like thinking about

120
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,990
them like like Jamaa methodology would

121
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:46,560
say you know like young son

122
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:48,600
going nature grab some vodka

123
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,209
in case it would be like some weed and

124
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,340
go ask the forest how we can use the

125
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:56,269
forest to do that you know work with the

126
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:58,560
forest you know what I mean and and just

127
00:06:56,269 --> 00:07:00,479
what's thinning it's great anyway so

128
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,089
it's like the basically maybe like cut

129
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:07,319
more trees down and and just and just

130
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:09,109
inoculate piles yes so and then you're

131
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,969
thinning the forests of the forest happy

132
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:16,889
I've got a flail mower from my excavator

133
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:20,550
so I can go up to like a 25-foot tree

134
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:23,430
and even like a 35-foot tree because I

135
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,530
can flail mow the top off and catch the

136
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,449
top in midair and suck it into the flare

137
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:30,209
mower and vaporize it that's like a

138
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:32,819
whole move I like a trick move and I've

139
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:35,370
developed but regardless of that you can

140
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,978
just straight up like slow-mo a tree you

141
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,290
know to the ground you can vaporize the

142
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:42,149
branches if you want if you you know go

143
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,250
into the branches slowly from the you

144
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:46,349
know and let the flail mower stuck them

145
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,180
in it'll it'll really just vaporize them

146
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,129
and shoot them right to the ground or if

147
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,709
you want to go in like just like fucking

148
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:54,478
wild like chunking like just throwing

149
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:56,069
shit everywhere you can kind of do that

150
00:07:54,478 --> 00:08:00,168
too you know it's like throw shit

151
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:03,599
everywhere I'll get down to the ground

152
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:06,029
and then you'll like it's clear and that

153
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,070
works fine too in certain situations you

154
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:10,319
know but sometimes you just want it more

155
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:12,990
clean you want to clean it's easier to

156
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,629
clean up too if I you know vaporize it

157
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,668
but clean up with a with a leaf rake is

158
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:20,399
like easy and then you have leaf mulch

159
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:22,978
you know like I mean then you have like

160
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,949
mow just like you know mulch up to your

161
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:27,870
knee you know I mean it's like two feet

162
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:31,288
three feet thick sometimes it's like

163
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:34,250
insane how much material that is when

164
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:38,370
you mulch at all a bunch of you know

165
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,360
wisteria or ceanothus or like some tan

166
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,459
Oaks or redwoods

167
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,440
it's amazing what how much how much

168
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,989
material is there get it to the ground

169
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,490
and then it just feeds and protects you

170
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:57,600
know erosion and

171
00:08:47,490 --> 00:09:01,470
- you know just physics all on and on so

172
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,070
yeah I love my my flail mower it's a

173
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:07,560
great way to build up your material you

174
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,879
have that can be composted in a quick

175
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:13,199
manner anyway to accelerate that I just

176
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,509
yeah you don't have to touch it like

177
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,620
with the chipper but I have limitations

178
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:21,269
you know on size but you know you end up

179
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,580
with like a piece sticking up so I just

180
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,379
cut that down you know and just toss

181
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:32,790
we're going to do whatever firewood or

182
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:34,529
just make it disappear oh yeah I mean

183
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:37,799
the tan oaks don't die the redwoods

184
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:40,199
don't die I'll flail mow a redwood down

185
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:41,639
to it just a little nubby stump as much

186
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,160
as I can get it to the close to the

187
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:47,250
ground and it'll be in one year it'll be

188
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:50,309
you know this high again tan oak - they

189
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:59,100
don't die madronas don't die the furrow

190
00:09:50,309 --> 00:10:01,139
died yeah it just seeds itself really

191
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,370
close like that - I just find it like

192
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:07,769
just yeah just it's you know so I just

193
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,960
like flail know it and it so I saves me

194
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:15,899
like you do like ten years worth of work

195
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:19,950
in like ten hours it's sort of like that

196
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:22,319
but it's it's a rotary one it's it

197
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:25,350
rotates this way it's not like this way

198
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:29,610
you know the blade has a it has flail

199
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:32,250
teeth on a hydraulic drum that rotates

200
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:36,180
like this so I have I have videos of it

201
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:38,279
it shit throws material I mean it's like

202
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:41,099
a chipper without the chipper it's like

203
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:44,009
having twenty flying goats like eating

204
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,519
shit like it's insane you have to be

205
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:49,230
careful yeah it's it's awesome yeah I

206
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,379
would never be able to do the type of

207
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:55,649
work you know that kind of brush work

208
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:59,070
manually as one guy a wall of like you

209
00:10:55,649 --> 00:11:01,559
know whatever and I just it's like fun

210
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:05,820
he just it's like painting he just like

211
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:09,179
mow it down it's easy I love my flower

212
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:12,690
I killed the motor on it I was operating

213
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:15,059
it on high my hot on my hydraulic pump

214
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:18,090
on high so I was that way I could really

215
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:19,739
like you know get some production going

216
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,110
on because it was kind of too slow it

217
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,930
was like you have to just kind of go

218
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,720
into a cut like this and it was really

219
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:31,329
limiting me to like kind of like you

220
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,820
know like work with the you know get

221
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,379
so I brought I brought my pump up what

222
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,410
amount of float what amount of flow do

223
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:40,600
you need to run like it was like I was

224
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:42,909
running it at like 25 which might pump

225
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,659
good hand Mike that's my flail mower

226
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:55,059
pump couldn't handle you know my

227
00:11:46,659 --> 00:12:04,149
excavator Oh what kind of excavator to

228
00:11:55,059 --> 00:12:06,039
many loader I know I wish I did

229
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:09,129
I need a track floater I need something

230
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:10,599
with either a PTO or something I need

231
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,399
something either tracks

232
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,370
I don't want wheels but I can't afford

233
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,549
tracks but so I'm just trying to use my

234
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:22,299
excavator is like the all-purpose you

235
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:24,759
know do it all I've got a bunch of

236
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:26,649
attachments for it so I can put any

237
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,559
attachment that fits on a skid steer on

238
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:33,429
my excavator so you know I've got like a

239
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:35,859
hookup so yeah I can put like Forks I've

240
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:37,599
got Forks on it you know I was gonna put

241
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,789
a chipper on it for a skid steer chipper

242
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,709
on my excavator so then I could reach

243
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:46,328
down the hill yes yes I'm not yes okay

244
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:48,099
that's what I wanted to hear yeah I was

245
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:49,689
going to I was curious about that if

246
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,269
that was like a super good idea because

247
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:55,180
or I could reach up the hill and put the

248
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:57,789
chipper up in the woods and put the

249
00:12:55,179 --> 00:13:00,039
chipper down in the woods you know and

250
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:02,139
then actually you know when the hills

251
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:04,838
are so steep then you just kids like

252
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:07,120
sidehill drop something downhill and

253
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,730
just feed the butt of it two feet right

254
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,860
into the chipper

255
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,990
and then you don't them move really

256
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,050
you're not moving you're not dragging

257
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,789
brush you're not winching you don't have

258
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:21,529
to reach down there all the way cuz a

259
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:24,539
lot of stuff you can't reach you know so

260
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:26,669
it's crazy what we have to do too you

261
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:28,759
know what I mean work on the site of

262
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:34,319
like a hill to me it's nuts

263
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:38,039
but yeah he knows yeah we live with we

264
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:45,450
live with woodchips and they usually

265
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:49,469
have wood chips on my hat I just use

266
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:52,050
them straight up yeah yeah he was asking

267
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,540
about like that's any screen evening to

268
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:57,689
me I think eyes they're breaking down

269
00:13:54,539 --> 00:14:00,689
those veins or punished you know they

270
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:04,050
just break down so easily you just find

271
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:06,670
a good vein or a pocket

272
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:07,990
yeah and then it's kind of like I like

273
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:09,610
the wood chips because they kind of got

274
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,289
like a lot of meat on the bone you know

275
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,550
what I mean they they last for a while

276
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:16,059
where other things just break down

277
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:20,139
quicker so you know if you're just like

278
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:22,149
it takes energy to apply them so you

279
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:24,819
know you might as well stay around for a

280
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:28,029
while where like grasses will just break

281
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:30,100
down quick you know like grasses or you

282
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:32,319
know plant material breaks down super

283
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,019
quick so you're you know you're kind of

284
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,920
just messing with it you know that's why

285
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:38,220
I like the wood chips they're just like

286
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,120
[Music]

287
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,870
that's yeah

288
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,310
protein high protein carbs not like

289
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,100
glasses which are sugar

290
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:50,379
you know like less less less of that but

291
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,080
more and then the jus Dom thing just

292
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:55,299
breaking down those grasses anyway into

293
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,970
a protein getting the protein out of

294
00:14:55,299 --> 00:15:00,279
those grasses instead of focusing on the

295
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,649
sugars in the grasses you know I guess

296
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:05,799
you know so I don't know I think that's

297
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:08,590
something like that it's but I know the

298
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:10,990
stinkier the better it seems there were

299
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:14,590
maggots in it I mean seriously like

300
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:16,269
giant giant like maggots in it I was

301
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,629
like I can't believe I'm really using

302
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:18,629
this

303
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:32,549
- kitchen scraps yeah some some gnarly

304
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,458
people turned up in there you know even

305
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:37,679
though it's sealed

306
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:39,000
oh there there I don't know how they get

307
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,719
in there I'm pretty they're obviously

308
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,778
there that I don't know I'm not claiming

309
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,970
to like be any like like I really I

310
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,708
don't have a background like science or

311
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,110
a guard you know and I was my dad was

312
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:53,578
like a sign painter I'm a welder and a

313
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,500
carpenter you know I mean that's like my

314
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:58,229
background I'm just kind of like winging

315
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:06,089
it and listening to whatever you know

316
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:08,550
I'm just yeah I don't know a lot of the

317
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:10,370
technical terms you know like I'm stuff

318
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:13,708
just because it's like there's so much

319
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:15,570
science and information now we've been

320
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,250
maybe I've been doing something for a

321
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:21,899
long time but you don't know what it's

322
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:28,078
called how long you been doing a KNF for

323
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:30,539
the one yeah even I mean I guess I've

324
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,099
been doing G Dom since I've been growing

325
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:33,958
because I've been doing like this

326
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,028
no-till thing since the beginning you

327
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:39,989
know so I've been basically and then I

328
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:43,649
been I find I basically like about like

329
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:48,778
five years ago I I went anaerobic just

330
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:50,970
on yeah yeah I went all anaerobic which

331
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:55,919
was kind of just an experiment because I

332
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:59,509
had broad mites so then I took all the

333
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,509
plants with the broad mites and

334
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:05,639
I put him in a barrel and a sealed

335
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,459
55-gallon barrel that was sealed with

336
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,520
the seal top and then added water and

337
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:14,160
some other you know a couple other

338
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,109
things but basically I just was you know

339
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,279
killed them you know that was a way to

340
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:20,969
kill any bugs

341
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:23,789
I deal in the Sun and what I did was

342
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:26,910
basically cultured I guess an anaerobic

343
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:28,889
like homeopathic remedy which I then

344
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,750
sprayed on the plants it was just like

345
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,340
spray I was like I I can't even believe

346
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:35,670
I was doing that I was like I'm actually

347
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:37,740
gonna do this like this nasty-ass like

348
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,679
and I was just like oh I couldn't resist

349
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,058
us like doing it do it and I just don't

350
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,410
do it my wife was like what the fuck are

351
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:45,450
you doing I was like I don't know I'm

352
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:47,340
just I'm just like I'm just like I don't

353
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,410
know I can't I get a watch something's

354
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:50,428
taking control of me I have no it's just

355
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,330
I have to do this

356
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:56,160
and so I did it and it and it worked and

357
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:59,369
it was fine there was like no problem in

358
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,440
fact you know I mean that was the year

359
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:06,529
that everybody had broad nights there's

360
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:11,600
a big Broadway from oh what oh yeah yeah

361
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:15,119
yeah that's probably one of our yeah

362
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:17,939
yeah yeah that would those are probably

363
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:21,719
oh no yeah these are I don't know one of

364
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,309
them is yeah this is the most this is

365
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,460
kind of like a mix

366
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:26,460
[Music]

367
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:38,319
but like yeah that's the mimosa

368
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:41,138
yeah that's like white Tahoe that's like

369
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:44,740
the that's the grow off strain from last

370
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:51,219
year I'm still smoking it this is like a

371
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:53,230
year and a half old yeah see I have

372
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,929
three year old need that looks greener

373
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:58,659
just like this from the when I when I

374
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:01,298
placed third at their moved up in 2017 I

375
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:05,139
put out two jars or with two mason jars

376
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:08,259
away basically you vacuum seal it in a

377
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:11,769
mason jar and put it in the freezer and

378
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:14,679
it will stay good for a long time it'll

379
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:17,500
stay green and like this has been stored

380
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:20,740
that way this this white Tahoe was

381
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,950
stored look at that yes I mean that's

382
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:26,378
like a year I got those that's like a

383
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:31,419
year and a half old for sure every bit

384
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:35,038
of a year and a half old and it's been a

385
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:35,038
it's been out of the freezer for a while

386
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:41,409
yeah you just don't don't just oh you

387
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,628
don't open the jar when you take it out

388
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:45,970
of the freezer you just let it sit until

389
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:48,779
it's there you know all the humidity

390
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:51,210
goes with all the moisture goes away

391
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:52,859
I guess and just then you just crack it

392
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:57,690
or sometimes I'll just pull it out of

393
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:59,579
the freezer crack a jar pop it open grab

394
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:03,180
some buds while it's like all icy and

395
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:06,329
shit grab some buds put the top back on

396
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:10,289
go over to the vacuum sealer reeve a ql

397
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:12,299
it stick it back in the freezer just

398
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:15,809
like that that's mostly what I do

399
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:17,159
that's just like easier that yeah then

400
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:19,980
you just take your little head stick

401
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,779
whatever half-ounce follow that out you

402
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,970
know whatever let it do its thing

403
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:25,139
sometimes it's perfect in like ten

404
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,110
minutes you're like it's perfect

405
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,390
whatever you know sometimes it's

406
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:32,369
sometimes if it's if it's like if it

407
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,950
gets to be like two years sometimes

408
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:38,849
it'll need

409
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:40,319
airing you know just yeah yeah at about

410
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:42,959
like two years because I've got some

411
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,929
like beer over three year old and it

412
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,840
looks literally better than my it looks

413
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:51,350
just like my my fresh silver like I'm

414
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,349
not even kidding

415
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:57,598
[Music]

416
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:08,539
I know that I'm not gonna even like

417
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:10,490
really like oh yeah yeah no yeah they're

418
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:13,789
just starting to like kind of break down

419
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:16,220
probably you know because I've had the

420
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:19,700
jar out now it's getting oxidized you

421
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,920
know I've been smoking on it yeah but

422
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:25,009
it's still you know you know what I want

423
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,230
to do now is test this I want to retest

424
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:30,740
this because I know I had the test from

425
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,660
when I harvested it so now I want to

426
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:36,259
test stop start testing stuff three or

427
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:38,750
two and three years later and I can I

428
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:41,779
would like to prove I would like to

429
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:45,410
prove that yeah with our techniques we

430
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:49,029
can keep we'd like at like fresh for

431
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,029
like three three years apparently

432
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:05,459
style covering ground yeah yo cuz you

433
00:22:01,378 --> 00:22:09,118
did ray did ray tell you about like the

434
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:13,609
eighths that in jars compared to the

435
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:13,608
same weed same batch same harvest

436
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:19,248
in the the weed that street heat

437
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:21,048
congregated together oh shit now we

438
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:24,829
fucked up now we don't have any eight

439
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:26,839
jars but they're dry and like it's

440
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:28,970
starting to turn the smell is starting

441
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:32,599
to go but if it's kept in the turkey bag

442
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:36,788
with the other stuff it's fresh like

443
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:41,628
vacuum sealed Oh different jars

444
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:52,788
themselves yeah those jars so we should

445
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:54,888
do should we should I don't know anybody

446
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,819
that's frizzy flowers and taking it like

447
00:22:54,888 --> 00:23:01,059
storage to the show

448
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:01,059
[Music]

449
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:07,640
level shit real like actually

450
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:36,319
incorporating that and I did let give

451
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:43,310
that away so everybody could read your

452
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:45,109
space yeah I mean that could be a thing

453
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:47,179
and then if you work with the retail or

454
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:49,879
some specific retail there's like no our

455
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,160
stuff is kept in the freezer and we take

456
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,900
it out and thought for you so it's like

457
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,970
a time machine it's true it's like a

458
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,030
time machine yeah and if we vacuum seal

459
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:00,690
it

460
00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:02,639
then freeze it and open it won't be Oh

461
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:07,110
at least it'll be vacuum sealed in the

462
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:13,440
back and then the jars are just like in

463
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:15,869
flats and they get even the samples can

464
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,630
be fresher is there so showing samples

465
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:20,759
that are like super old and oxidized and

466
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,260
oh yeah open closed open closed open

467
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,180
closed for months and then you could

468
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,369
just take out as they need it from your

469
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,529
freezer keep it like a fresh sample like

470
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:46,250
that's cute quality control right there

471
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:49,410
I mean cannabis Humboldt sunrise farms

472
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:51,480
yeah working with the legacy farmers in

473
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:54,210
over 40 years with a bunch of goats and

474
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,400
worm castings he's been doing a

475
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,370
regenerative leave before regenerative

476
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,380
Lee was the thing

477
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:03,339
but now we're trying to implement some

478
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:06,470
of these like an empty fuel beds and

479
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:08,658
making the transition you know to more

480
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,069
regenerative stuff so hopefully I know

481
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:12,528
we can talk about some sort of

482
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:17,359
certification in the future throw it out

483
00:25:12,528 --> 00:25:19,250
there you know there's certifications

484
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:23,000
yeah whatever the you know any round

485
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:25,700
it's like it's just beyond that it's all

486
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,970
good but you know it's just like labels

487
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,440
and whatever and you know I

488
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,659
yeah we're trying to figure out

489
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,058
packaging's though ourselves like what's

490
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:38,990
the most eco conscious packaging you

491
00:25:35,058 --> 00:25:40,579
know like some some corn plastic some

492
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,470
hemp plastic we'll be like will be cool

493
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:45,158
some vegetable stuff yeah they got some

494
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:49,370
hemp plastics coming online right here

495
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:51,649
but we're still rocking like the glass

496
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:54,379
you know I mean we got our this is what

497
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:56,569
we're rocking here you can check it out

498
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:00,320
look we got the Emerald cup thing on

499
00:25:56,569 --> 00:26:04,609
there from 2017 where we took third in

500
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:07,808
our third decade old living soil with

501
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:07,808
just water and

502
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,779
one compost tea just as a default and

503
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:20,619
default style just like one just like to

504
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:24,529
to compost teas a year to my soil and

505
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:28,369
and a top dress of woodchips and tie

506
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:31,099
fungal just you know and and then the

507
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:35,209
Hugo's like it's kind of like a hugo bed

508
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:39,259
within a hugo bed so you know it's it's

509
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:41,630
like yeah basically it's kind of like a

510
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:46,670
hugo bed inside of a hugo bed inside of

511
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:50,750
a hugo bed how do you start in the

512
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:53,120
trench or like oh great i do like a

513
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:55,250
subterranean pit thing little trench

514
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,169
things well looks like a full greenhouse

515
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,450
size like that's why i have an excavator

516
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:01,850
that's why that's why i say there's the

517
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:04,640
more work you put in on the front end on

518
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:08,240
the back end and i'm not kidding

519
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,880
like you know I don't do there's a big

520
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,029
difference between growing okay here it

521
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,980
is like in pox and then you have you

522
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:17,720
know on the big pots on the ground then

523
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,309
you got like raised beds on the ground

524
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,190
and then you've got like in the ground

525
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:25,279
and then there's like subterranean in

526
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:28,220
the ground you know what I mean which is

527
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,039
it just is some serious magic going on

528
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,870
there but you have to you know you have

529
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:38,809
to make some impact on the environment

530
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:41,059
yes forever he'd go for control with it

531
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:42,559
so as far as because we have Gophers so

532
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,450
you're kind of like a lot of that like

533
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,549
tractor work is almost like because of

534
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:49,309
Gophers you know I mean case if you're

535
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:51,109
doing like high production like that you

536
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:53,569
kind of have to like lock your space in

537
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:55,729
you know I mean so like do you kind of

538
00:27:53,569 --> 00:27:57,589
like lock it in from the Gophers or or

539
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,870
critters because they'll just fuck your

540
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:03,259
shit up so you know you got no choice

541
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:04,529
but to take you know measures but after

542
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:06,779
a certain amount of years

543
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:08,460
of regenerative practices cover crops

544
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:10,440
and soil too it's like okay you might

545
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,710
disturb the soil you know you disturb

546
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:17,220
the soil initially but it's like okay

547
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:19,559
because you know what we're doing is

548
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:22,350
like it's so easy to bring it back with

549
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:24,659
like make a ji message a Dom microbial

550
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:28,339
solution which is what I was like using

551
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:32,070
this year with sea-salt potatoes and an

552
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:35,429
anaerobic you know culturing of your

553
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:37,379
microbes in a readily available liquid

554
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:42,330
form that you can spray through a

555
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:44,760
sprayer foliar or just water it in so

556
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:46,379
which is just like solid microbes you

557
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:49,039
know it's like I like uh like I'll just

558
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:52,560
as just a layer of just beautiful like

559
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:55,829
microbes so you just you know just just

560
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,629
trying to out-compete anything else like

561
00:28:55,829 --> 00:29:02,699
not worry about anything else just like

562
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:05,310
keep on the you know proactive make sure

563
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,230
that it's always inoculated at the good

564
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:09,359
stuff yeah there's so many beneficial

565
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:15,150
microbes and bacteria and fungus that

566
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:21,000
like you know whatever brand or was it

567
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:25,040
bar'el it was barley barley is just like

568
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,470
kind of invasive cover crops natural

569
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:31,230
crap I've got some lambsquarters that

570
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,670
shows that I like invasive gardening

571
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:38,160
techniques you know I mean stuff that

572
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:41,029
just like in you know it's just like

573
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:44,340
makes my life easier yeah always they're

574
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:48,980
like nettles man I was like nettles and

575
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:51,980
purslane and like chick weed and

576
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,980
different

577
00:29:52,489 --> 00:29:59,778
yeah I got the cellphone that is our

578
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:59,778
nothing South African ground cherries

579
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:12,418
yeah they're just like a tomatillo and

580
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:14,519
vining kind of they'll pop up through

581
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:16,499
the trellis and out-compete her hands

582
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,169
and I'll just have to step on it and be

583
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:21,058
like no you chill out right and then you

584
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:23,459
get some some of those some some good

585
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:27,769
juices yeah I just like step on them you

586
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:27,769
know like step on them in there you know

587
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:33,239
they don't take too much nutrients from

588
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:35,338
the front I won't even worry

589
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:47,179
I have potatoes in there oh yeah like

590
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:47,178
every whatever everything in it works

591
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:10,878
trying too hard you know you can use

592
00:31:09,028 --> 00:31:14,190
whatever you know yeah hell yeah

593
00:31:10,878 --> 00:31:15,778
whatever's available and yeah it ever

594
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:19,369
wants to be there I just kind of like

595
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:22,709
the pull yeah man that's all with it try

596
00:31:19,368 --> 00:31:24,970
yeah that works I'll say Nettles oh

597
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:27,549
that's what's good yeah

598
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:29,740
- no you do the horsetail Equus either

599
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:31,899
oh yeah yeah we have horsetail on our

600
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,880
property our Sabine spring creeks got a

601
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,860
ton of horse tail so we were used we

602
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,250
were going you know we jail left horse

603
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:42,969
tell ya it was fullering horse tell

604
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:46,390
what's the jLF process it's your job

605
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:53,230
yeah that's that's that anaerobic you

606
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:54,970
know the culturing yeah that's what the

607
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:56,769
culture more you instead of like

608
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,380
fermenting I don't know it's probably

609
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:01,750
just like tomato tomahto yeah yeah you

610
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,180
know but like can that KNF we are more

611
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:07,809
focusing on fermenting oh I feel like

612
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:10,150
I'm more culturing I'm not really like

613
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:12,309
fermenting with like sugar and trying to

614
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:17,470
like do that fermentation you're not

615
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:25,659
sealing it up yeah you put a

616
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:27,339
fermentation lock on it I mean it's so

617
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,009
easy it's not even like rocket science

618
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:33,669
by animal you know it's really just so

619
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:36,400
easy just that we just you know the

620
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:39,220
first time I play this is the first year

621
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,540
I played with some horse tail extract

622
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,960
and I you know went out in the morning

623
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:46,930
got the little new girl Spears of it you

624
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,419
know five gallon bucket of it some

625
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:53,058
boiling water mashed it up and then

626
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:55,519
not related with the lactam serious lack

627
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:59,418
of the soul serum you know let that let

628
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:02,298
that cook for a week sealed up I mean

629
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:04,399
the plants did some big things like that

630
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:07,878
they just went on old mode and the pest

631
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,138
pressure was like yeah I really don't

632
00:33:07,878 --> 00:33:11,089
know what was going on but something

633
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:12,349
good I'm do do some more of that for

634
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,058
sure this stuff works

635
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:17,868
yeah it's a really work yeah get some

636
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:21,019
lab this year yeah would you a foliar I

637
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:25,928
did a foliar even it like week had like

638
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:25,929
a couple of some was like leaf necrosis

639
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:34,759
I show up you know like trying to just

640
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,759
keep the beneficial back to you

641
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:44,910
yeah buddy look for the labs like do you

642
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,470
harvest them from the air you use in

643
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:48,450
some em1 because that I just get a

644
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:57,990
bottle I don't even make this one it was

645
00:33:48,450 --> 00:34:00,090
my buddy made it I know you gave me some

646
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:05,339
labs so I used it and because we were

647
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:07,199
like I was like I think I need yeah I'd

648
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:10,230
like this play because somebody got K&amp;F

649
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,460
like sloppy or K&amp;F crazy on my shit you

650
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:15,628
know what I mean

651
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:17,909
so and I they gave me the plague we were

652
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:19,589
calling it the plague I ended up with

653
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:22,320
like what we were calling a plague which

654
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:24,358
was like a leaf necrosis like like

655
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,550
eating like fucking like Leafs we're

656
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:28,549
stuck like eating into it and like

657
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:34,559
whatever you don't want to hear it you

658
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,378
know whatever you know it came from the

659
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,940
dude left his sprayer in the Sun okay

660
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:42,480
with this shit didn't clean out his

661
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:46,530
square left in the Sun sprayed after

662
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:50,090
that did whatever basically did whatever

663
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:52,740
happened in there went on to my plan and

664
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:55,079
that wasn't good that's not what where I

665
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:59,659
was going for I noticed someone I said

666
00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:02,489
KNF sloppy some mutant serrations from

667
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:04,139
K&amp;F done wrong so I had to come in with

668
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:08,009
like zaimes to just kind of like get

669
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:10,440
like but at that point the plants were

670
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:13,120
so loud that that it was literally like

671
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,190
i tearing like they were

672
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,230
and I was like whoa and then I signed

673
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:20,470
him and it killed it it really did take

674
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:22,809
out that it took that out but I mean

675
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:25,000
it's still loud but it was yea infected

676
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:26,920
the Terps for sure but I feel like I had

677
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,590
to do that because I look it's not what

678
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,360
I wish is a dangerous situation you know

679
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,430
and it was 2019

680
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,349
I got to pay the bills you know what I

681
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:38,230
mean and not to be like that but it was

682
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:40,599
like it's a lot that was my only harvest

683
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:43,659
of the year - I didn't have any so I

684
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:48,699
really just had to just you know make

685
00:35:43,659 --> 00:36:01,269
sure it was good yeah try not the

686
00:35:48,699 --> 00:36:03,039
spaceship but yeah it was fine it turned

687
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:13,269
out fine don't work and then I'll add

688
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:18,070
and then I which I was going to maybe

689
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:20,860
hit it with the Janome sulfur and the

690
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:24,250
whole the whole Jidong you know and I

691
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:27,309
was like you know I just gotta like you

692
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:30,489
know know do something that I'm is more

693
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:33,610
reliable like I wasn't ready for that

694
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:46,659
I didn't made up and they and besides

695
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:48,880
that and the ethic pressure oh yeah okay

696
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:51,279
there's that there's a natural cycle to

697
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,930
this we're gonna you know we're gonna go

698
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,640
spraying like three times in the in the

699
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:56,289
morning I would spray off I would do

700
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,000
spray zaimes in the morning for the

701
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:59,769
aphids yeah and then I would come

702
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,440
through and and physically spray off

703
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:04,780
again physically remove them dead bodies

704
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,000
and spray them off that pressure was

705
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,980
like yes they get him off and then I

706
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,659
would let that draw you know dry off and

707
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:15,300
then I'd come through and spray like

708
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:19,190
rosemary horsetail whatever I was making

709
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:22,619
a bunch of stuff like that JMS Jayla

710
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:27,750
yeah spicy peppers oh no I was just more

711
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:30,838
going like beneficial you know not past

712
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,608
not necessarily for them you know fight

713
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:38,519
the past but just for their plants you

714
00:37:32,608 --> 00:37:39,869
know just a restore the leaf surface was

715
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:41,429
all in like the morning that was the

716
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:45,869
mother that was like three sprays in the

717
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:47,190
more he just like that's how every day

718
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:51,960
yeah every day

719
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:53,369
three three Oh like whatever as long as

720
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,679
it doesn't you don't even you don't ask

721
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:59,160
how long it's just for whatever

722
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:02,250
yeah then forever until for whatever you

723
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:03,868
need to do otherwise but then once you

724
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:09,000
get that shit under control then it was

725
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:10,769
like but never really got super under

726
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,869
control from what I saw I just saw that

727
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:14,489
they didn't end up in fest they didn't

728
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:17,608
like to infest in the resin they don't

729
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:19,949
like to like have babies and prolific in

730
00:38:17,608 --> 00:38:22,079
the resident in the flowers you know so

731
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:22,919
like it wasn't a big problem it was

732
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,400
really scary

733
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,720
in late bed early flower but cuz you

734
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,970
seem like they're on the buds there on

735
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:31,949
the bud sighs what's going on man but

736
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:34,439
after the resin showed up that started

737
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:35,879
like oh it's protecting itself and we

738
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,030
didn't I don't think we needed to worry

739
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,760
about it as much as we did I'm looking

740
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:43,920
at their neighbors that really didn't do

741
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,470
shit they just let the green lacewing

742
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,750
show up in the ladybugs show oh yeah oh

743
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:50,939
yeah I did lady balls I thought they

744
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,710
were yeah you know and they showed up in

745
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,108
such numbers that they thought there was

746
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:57,059
an infestation of some mutant shit but

747
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:59,670
they were green lacewing larvae you know

748
00:38:57,059 --> 00:39:02,079
they were just just watch them in the

749
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:06,369
macro video just chomping away

750
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,900
it's so it's like they've like they need

751
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:10,239
the Athan pressure so that the

752
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,670
population so the beneficial population

753
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,459
gets to balance you know and I think

754
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:17,289
next year we'll be able be able to ride

755
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,570
the aphid problem a little bit more

756
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:24,039
smugly hope I know like I don't even

757
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:25,900
want to say what what problems we could

758
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:28,719
have and all of it's always something

759
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,519
hopefully it's not a every other year

760
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:33,489
he'll give us a break the lack of

761
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:35,500
extreme temperature in that winter and

762
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:37,449
like we didn't have much snow and a lot

763
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,239
of it was cold and have a lot of heat

764
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:42,129
and right didn't have enough heat to

765
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:46,500
process through some of the food you

766
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:46,500
know like we were like we fed nitrogen

767
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:53,440
in coal and conditions you know and they

768
00:39:51,250 --> 00:40:03,400
don't have the Sun to process it a lot

769
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:05,650
of bad things come out you yeah if you

770
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:12,849
have like a fire if there's a fire and

771
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:16,119
the Sun gets well the Sun is like super

772
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:21,429
inconsistent I mean it's never like the

773
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:24,269
same twice you know I think like no day

774
00:40:21,429 --> 00:40:28,029
in your life will be the same as a

775
00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:34,210
amount you know of life you know quality

776
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:36,970
and quantity of life it'll never be as

777
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:40,329
it's just so inconsistent that every day

778
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:42,009
the Lovelight levels are different in

779
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:44,559
your life that'll never be like the same

780
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,720
right now so that's just sure that's

781
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,670
what we're dealing with

782
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:50,079
that's like maybe that's wrong I don't

783
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:53,280
know maybe somebody's going to prove

784
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,630
that wrong I don't know

785
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,440
that's somebody something told me so I

786
00:40:55,630 --> 00:41:01,090
don't know just so yeah it's why 2018 is

787
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,039
a little bit different in 2019 yeah

788
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:07,480
that's why edits drive every year is so

789
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:11,079
different I mean it is part of the

790
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:14,590
beauty yeah yes guys why you need tools

791
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:41,409
in your toolkit to adapt that's where

792
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:44,110
the full spectrum comes in there's

793
00:41:41,409 --> 00:41:47,049
little pockets lower elevation or the

794
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:49,360
cold sits for a little bit longer it's a

795
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:51,460
little bit more humid higher elevation a

796
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,950
little bit more dry a little bit more

797
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:57,090
intense exposure to the Sun out of the

798
00:41:53,949 --> 00:41:59,679
trees you know and you see the the soil

799
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,269
dries out a little bit differently you

800
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:02,489
know

801
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:03,630
different at these different elevations

802
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:09,139
and microclimates

803
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:13,500
I don't know trying to stick to the VPD

804
00:42:09,139 --> 00:42:15,869
you know a little bit to get that you

805
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,590
know that Turner pressure going firing

806
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:21,809
all the time it's tricky because you got

807
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:24,030
all these you comment in multiple places

808
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:27,449
that get at different times you know so

809
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:30,060
I'm thinking about the soil down at 1300

810
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:31,949
feet versus you know at 2,000 feet and

811
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:34,889
there's totally different things going

812
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:37,829
on you know it's a cool little thing to

813
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:40,079
follow yeah you just gotta like adapt

814
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:42,239
and try to keep everything consistent

815
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,590
that's what it's all about consistency

816
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:49,500
consistency consistency so like no

817
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:51,510
matter whatever you're doing you want to

818
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:55,039
mean yeah there's like doesn't matter

819
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:57,960
like do every whatever whatever whenever

820
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,389
it's like that's its consistency

821
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,769
consistency consistency that's what

822
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:07,769
equals quality I think ultimately

823
00:43:03,769 --> 00:43:10,909
consistency equals quality or I know a

824
00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:10,909
bunch of other shipping course
