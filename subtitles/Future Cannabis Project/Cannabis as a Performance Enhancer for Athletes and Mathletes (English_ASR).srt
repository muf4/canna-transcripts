00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,959
I've seen a couple guys that would smoke

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,548
regularly and it was like something they

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,490
did every day I wake up smoking off the

4
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,888
practice they smoked and told me that it

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,539
actually dulled the pain increase their

6
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:14,218
pain threshold so like you said I think

7
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:15,689
it is kind of cheating because all the

8
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:17,278
guys that were never injured they were

9
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:18,839
always at practice they're always focus

10
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,278
having a good time we're the guys that

11
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,739
smoke weed you know I don't know if it's

12
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:23,850
because they're they're just relaxed and

13
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:25,108
living life they're just out there

14
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,460
getting it but actually you know you

15
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,199
start to realize that they're

16
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,839
inflammations worse they're less pain

17
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,420
and they're functioning properly yeah so

18
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,799
it's it's amazing to see that the people

19
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,690
that are using were the ones that were

20
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,099
actually doing good and the ones that

21
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:40,409
weren't we're the ones that were feeling

22
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,609
the pain and whatnot so that's kind of

23
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:43,679
productive what they teach you growing

24
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,179
up is that oh it's bad you smoke it's

25
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,320
gonna ruin your lungs you're gonna get

26
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,909
cancer which I don't know anybody that

27
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,359
passed away from cancer from smoking

28
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:52,619
weed or overdose either you could to

29
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,600
have too much of a edible and you feel

30
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,140
like she's gonna die of it you don't

31
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,140
actually die
