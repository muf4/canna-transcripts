2
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:20,358
the stats are showing over just the last

3
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:21,799
seven years that the potency of cannabis

4
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,810
are the stuff that definitely the stuff

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,149
that both of us grew up with is

6
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:28,098
substantially lower six seven eight nine

7
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:29,209
percent now we're looking at twenty one

8
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:32,329
twenty four I mean some of these

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,759
Chernobyl and crazy claimed in the 30s

10
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:35,929
mid thirty percent what's your opinion

11
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,149
of that because that's the one thing

12
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:39,350
I've realized is I thought oh yeah it's

13
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:40,640
gonna be all the friends that I grew up

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,859
with all my kind of surfer stoner

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,299
buddies from from NorCal they are gonna

16
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:46,579
want the higher more potent the better

17
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:49,009
but then the fastest-growing segment is

18
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,660
our generations it's the older genex

19
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,969
it's a baby boomer it's a Silent

20
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:54,679
Generation that they don't want they

21
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:57,109
want to take something back up it isn't

22
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,939
alcohol that isn't over-the-counter that

23
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:00,530
isn't prescription but then all of a

24
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:02,659
sudden I take one puff and they're just

25
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,969
like that's equivalent of a whole joint

26
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:07,099
so what do you think is there any way to

27
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:09,709
disrupt this this race to the top for

28
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:12,079
the state specific potency is the

29
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:14,719
crudest a measure that we have of the

30
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,810
effect of cannabis right and and and

31
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:21,200
it's it's useful mainly for THC right

32
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,820
and and in it back in those days that I

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,219
was talking about before we had cannabis

34
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:26,989
and a lot of analytics right that was

35
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:29,359
really the only thing that we could do

36
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:32,239
right but now it's not so much a

37
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,188
question of stronger or weaker more

38
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,368
potent or less potent it's a question of

39
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:39,589
dialing in the cannabinoid and terpene

40
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:41,090
profile right so one of the really

41
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,820
interesting things that we've learned

42
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,579
now is that terpenes right terpenes are

43
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:48,709
the elements the chemical compounds that

44
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:51,228
give all everything in the world that

45
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:54,199
has a flavor or a smell returning

46
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:55,310
vanilla extract obviously right so so

47
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,920
what we've learned though is the

48
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,109
terpenes have profound synergistic

49
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,079
effects with cannabinoids and just a

50
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:06,590
little bit of terpene can can radically

51
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:09,439
alter the therapeutic or subjective user

52
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,289
effect of a particular profile of

53
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,519
cannabinoid

54
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,348
right so it used to be that we just

55
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:16,140
talked about strong or weak cannabis but

56
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:17,369
now we talk about CBD THC we're getting

57
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,068
to the point now we're starting to talk

58
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,709
about CBN with CBG right yeah

59
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:24,658
and th TV so we're talking about a range

60
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:29,128
of cannabinoids think of those

61
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:31,019
cannabinoids CBD THC CBD THC v that

62
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:34,798
whole constellation of cannabinoids

63
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:37,920
right as the engine right that drives us

64
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:40,769
forward think about terpenes as the

65
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,289
steering wheel like so just a little bit

66
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,719
of terpene one terpene or another can

67
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:47,638
can really put your effect in a

68
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,709
different direction this is we can

69
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,840
measure this therapeutically we believe

70
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,329
it's also true with subjective user

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,359
effect so it's not stronger or weaker

72
00:02:54,329 --> 00:03:00,870
it's you know where do you want to go

73
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:02,790
with it and it's going to take us years

74
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,329
to develop the science let me caution

75
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:08,459
consumers right if you see a product and

76
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:10,500
it has something on it like calm or

77
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,560
alert or something like that

78
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:17,219
don't believe it it's not true there's

79
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,799
no science yet CREB will be one day we

80
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,598
will be able to associate specific

81
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,239
cannabinoid and terpene profiles with

82
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:27,089
specific therapeutic and and user

83
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,469
experience effects right we're not there

84
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,419
yet but we're on the verge of figuring

85
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:32,340
it out and that's really that's an

86
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,680
interesting point because I feel that's

87
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,359
a 2.0 tier point like I know mersin I

88
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,189
know laminate like I know the terpenes

89
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:40,979
that I like so to your point I'm not

90
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:43,049
just looking at oh this is 27% that's a

91
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,729
bit much for me anything over the teens

92
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,620
honestly I don't but more so looking at

93
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:48,389
the terpene profile so it's so funny

94
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,158
that people in this day and you know it

95
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:51,689
you hear it well what do you prefer

96
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,848
and you probably laugh when people asses

97
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,378
indica or sativa and you're like really

98
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:57,238
I mean people ask me and I'm like can

99
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:57,899
you really show me a true indica or true

100
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,878
sativa

101
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,799
but even that aside not talking about

102
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,750
this or that in this - would it what is

103
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,579
your terpene profile that works for your

104
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,019
body like literally what is the terpene

105
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,969
profile in the cannabinoid profile that

106
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,039
fits you as an individual with your

107
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,489
endocannabinoid system versus because

108
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,679
you're right

109
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,569
you're comma and it could add Rosenthal

110
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,150
I know you know add so Jane and I were

111
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:20,370
catching up and we were talking about is

112
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,019
his Stardust and I love it Stardust is

113
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,620
in certain situations

114
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,560
I can't consume conventionally

115
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,579
so Jane goes hey you know it took care

116
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,740
of you right I'm like yeah I think Edie

117
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:30,879
so he's taking care of me it's like so

118
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,290
you're like I'm like I do it with an

119
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,930
herbal tea I do it with tumeric and

120
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,100
ginger at night it helps me sleep she

121
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,418
goes that's funny I use it in the

122
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,189
morning and then I go in a cleaning

123
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:40,750
spree throughout the house that's a

124
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:43,509
perfect example I think to your point of

125
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,250
don't say oh yeah this product is alert

126
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:47,199
for you and I or is calm for you and I

127
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,910
or is this for you and I are that for

128
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,379
you night because it is very individual

129
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,199
and we have to know our own respective

130
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:55,629
profiles there's a psychedelic

131
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,580
revolution that is going on and and and

132
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,290
cannabis has become so mainstream that

133
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:01,810
sometimes we forget that cannabis is a

134
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,819
psychedelic substance one of the things

135
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:07,149
that it does is it is it is it

136
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:08,529
suppresses our our default mode network

137
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:10,179
in our brain to thing that's always

138
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:12,129
thinking all the time in the regular

139
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,629
straight kind of one after another kind

140
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:16,839
of way right and it helps us see a

141
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:18,699
broader spectrum of things well key to

142
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:22,538
that experience to any psychedelic

143
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:24,788
experience is set your mindset where are

144
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:26,168
you inside you how are you feeling

145
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:27,519
what's going on in your life what are

146
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:29,259
you thinking about are you you know

147
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,609
what's going on yeah you stress you have

148
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:33,250
you sad like what are you setting

149
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,229
yourself up and and then what

150
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,240
environment are you at when you are

151
00:05:35,228 --> 00:05:39,279
consuming that psychedelic substance

152
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,288
right and that set and setting are

153
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,809
really critically important true with

154
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:47,430
cannabis and then we layer in the fact

155
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:50,589
that like every other kind of medicine

156
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,199
cannabis interacts with an individual's

157
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:56,219
own body and our bodies very are

158
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,240
endocannabinoids systems very right so

159
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,160
this is one of the things I love about

160
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,348
cannabis it's this treasure chest that

161
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,229
we will be opening up and thinking about

162
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:06,459
and figuring out for a long time to come

163
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:09,300
so much more your time

164
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:09,299
alright much more to come

165
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:18,769
