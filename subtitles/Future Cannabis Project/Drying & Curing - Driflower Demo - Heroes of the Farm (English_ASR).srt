2
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:35,310
yo what's going on guys it's a path with

3
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,250
heroes of the farm today I want to

4
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:41,460
discuss and talk about the new dried

5
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,320
flower not a rack system you know this

6
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,640
is a rack system that has been designed

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,159
over the last couple years by some

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,530
homies down in South Oregon you know

9
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,769
it's not only for you know cannabis but

10
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,870
also for him and the reason that these

11
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,550
hang these hanger systems are made of

12
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:58,289
metal is for the amount of weight which

13
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:00,238
you put on them so you know honestly

14
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,549
we're putting not that mental product

15
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,920
you know for what women these can

16
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:07,769
actually hold to capacity when talking

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,320
about them but you know that being said

18
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:13,859
there is two different sizes available

19
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:17,009
right now you've got a 21 inch and a 41

20
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,599
inch you know the 41 inch you know it's

21
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,480
good for what we're doing but really

22
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,949
they make whole pod systems for out in

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,960
the field or

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm trying solutions where you can take

25
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,359
coal hemp plants and you know stuff one

26
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,069
of these rats all the way fill full you

27
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,349
know the thing about this is first off

28
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:35,728
its american-made so it's definitely

29
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:38,579
looking more expensive because of that

30
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:40,379
but you know these aluminum hangers you

31
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,590
know have been really thought out and

32
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,780
designed that you can fit more weight

33
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:48,240
without that hanger bowing in comparison

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,609
to a plastic hanger you know over the

35
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,280
last 15 years I've used all types of

36
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:55,019
different drying systems you know there

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,700
is the trellis technique where we're

38
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,589
loading and unloading you've seen a lot

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,689
of the new trellis techniques a lot of

40
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,939
my systems where they'll slide on racks

41
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,798
and pull it in and out the problem that

42
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,259
is is you're loading on and you're

43
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,360
loading on you know with their system

44
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,430
that we use in here before we just did a

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,620
little coat racks and I've collected you

46
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,569
know over the last decade plastic

47
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,920
hangers but you know every time we load

48
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:19,318
them both as you have to go inside of

49
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:23,099
the hanger the real benefit to these is

50
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:25,530
what its locking so we can literally you

51
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,509
know put one side weight on there and

52
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,759
not have them probably fall off

53
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:31,979
unless I'm shaking like that but when

54
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,409
you're done and the products dry here is

55
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:35,939
the real benefit in the solution inside

56
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:36,849
of this again this is the web product

57
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:38,289
you know I'm not ready

58
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,389
to come off but I'm just going to show

59
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:43,299
you real quick is if this was a hanger

60
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:44,889
chela's tech you know line you're always

61
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,750
having to pull that back off and you're

62
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:50,609
handling that product more and it's

63
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,610
taking a lot of time versus okay I'm not

64
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:02,560
locks back on the bigger hangar you know

65
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,359
again there's quite a bit of weight on

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,979
here cuz it's wet but I can break this

67
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,980
down lay this down in my den gracefully

68
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:23,479
so you know again when you look at the

69
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:25,549
thought that's gone into this to be able

70
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:27,889
to hold this type of weight this piece

71
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:31,670
of aluminum is actually bent and curled

72
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:33,289
in and again that's what makes this so

73
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,539
strong you know you could probably

74
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:39,039
literally hang on to this I'm not going

75
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:42,439
to again all aluminum made an Oregon USA

76
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:46,009
by the homie J you know Jay has spent

77
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:49,699
years literally designing these locking

78
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:52,250
systems and these overall wraps

79
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:55,068
you know they offer basically the hanger

80
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,780
the brackets to the hanger is kind of

81
00:03:55,068 --> 00:04:00,589
the big things that they're offering

82
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,449
right here it's all you know all the

83
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,030
patents are in the website is about to

84
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:07,879
be up if you have interests you can

85
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,590
reach out with the MDM and we can give

86
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,879
you all the brochures and informational

87
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,680
so the website is up it should be

88
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,719
dropping here than this we like two

89
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,280
weeks but in the meantime we're just

90
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,500
kind of showing you guys the system

91
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,289
that's coming up that's gonna be offered

92
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,699
through Heroes and through dry flour

93
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,400
you know I'm fortunate enough to be able

94
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,860
to get to you know utilize

95
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,159
and kind of prototype them and give them

96
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,290
feedback and have been for some time now

97
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,560
they do offer these stands which if you

98
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,509
look at the stands so the one thing

99
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,978
that's nice about these stances and you

100
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:41,710
know if you saw the first video that we

101
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:44,589
put out you know in this room we can fit

102
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:46,750
easily about 120 pounds with our old

103
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:48,519
writing system with the new dragon

104
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,189
system we can actually fit about 20 to

105
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:53,019
25% more because we condense Li you put

106
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:55,538
everything on the hangers when we're

107
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:56,978
done basically the bars you know break

108
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:59,649
everything down to the bins as we showed

109
00:04:56,978 --> 00:05:19,719
you and then the bars click out and then

110
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:22,959
from there versus I could show you in my

111
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,840
other area where I have I don't know 60

112
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:28,810
coat hanger racks and where I've got

113
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,609
trellis you know that's a mess you know

114
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,420
so and all the drawing systems that I've

115
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,840
built seen used over

116
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,460
fifteen years this you know by far you

117
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,889
know kind of takes the cake

118
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:42,680
you're also you know supporting growers

119
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:44,659
it's built for growers by growers and

120
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,790
it's built in in the United States which

121
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,870
you know right now in the pandemic I

122
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,160
think that should be important to

123
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,819
everyone because it's definitely for it

124
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,260
to us and the other thing you know just

125
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:56,959
about these systems is the way that they

126
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:59,480
flow you know for not only canvas but

127
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,339
for heaven you haven't seen him get but

128
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,290
there is pot systems that Jay has come

129
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:05,329
up with that literally you can build

130
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,730
these four stories high he's got

131
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:10,849
basically some detector coming out of

132
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,890
trailers for it field harvest and you're

133
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,120
gonna see all of these basically come up

134
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,620
you know through the Instagram through

135
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,079
like these and through demos and

136
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,670
tutorials that will continue to do but

137
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,430
here's just a little bit further of a

138
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:25,400
sneak peak of the dry flour dry racks

139
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:28,069
the bars you know the hangers and the

140
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,899
clips for the hanging solutions if you

141
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:32,659
have more questions please hit me up I

142
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:35,989
can get you in touch you know with Jay

143
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,630
they do offer custom room designs so I

144
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,280
have very short ceilings in here so you

145
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:43,279
can actually get these so they're three

146
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:45,679
four eight however many tiers up Jay

147
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:48,559
specifically build these racks for this

148
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,720
room that has basically a lower ceiling

149
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,899
design

150
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,250
Agro right below us you know a second

151
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:56,019
floor so we just don't have a high

152
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,089
ceiling as an option so if we have

153
00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:01,719
higher ceilings we could maximize our

154
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:03,909
space even further so you know breakout

155
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,320
with this system like I said we've been

156
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,050
able to increase about twenty to

157
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,060
twenty-five percent you know overall

158
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,910
mass that we can put into these rooms

159
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,129
because of the organization you know and

160
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,620
if you again look at how neat this all

161
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:20,439
is absolutely amazing

162
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,649
so those right now are the two sizes of

163
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:26,189
hangers that are offered and a little

164
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:28,289
bit about the company you know

165
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:30,199
