[Music]

2
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:29,640
from guys like don't spray yep right

3
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,950
they just don't they're like we don't

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,750
spray we you know we had neem oil and

5
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,210
the base for revenge

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,369
we moved to trifecta you know and saying

7
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,620
or we moved to venerate or we moved to a

8
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,738
big-time exterminator you know all the

9
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:49,439
clean trim you know all the clean

10
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:50,669
pesticides we don't or we have garlic

11
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:59,128
clove oil

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:01:02,789
oh just 500 pounds you give it just

13
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:05,250
tested dirty and these guys like no it's

14
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:09,599
my god and and and and then you know

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,700
shit but I bought my clone from Kyle but

16
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,250
it even goes further than two because so

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,829
many times whenever a person that's

18
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,579
sourcing trim it to make it an extract

19
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:22,819
they themselves with their dirty machine

20
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,500
are what are getting the plant material

21
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:27,719
contaminated and so so they'll like you

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,239
know you know run them run you know this

23
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,519
material from this organic farmer who's

24
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,959
never sprayed or who who may have if

25
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,280
anything got a dirty clone but it

26
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,689
wouldn't show up in really that

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,549
substantial amount if it was grown

28
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,859
full-time outdoor the UV broke down the

29
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,509
pesticides and you know by that time you

30
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:44,579
know you wouldn't really see it in big

31
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,659
amounts where most people are seeing big

32
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,670
amounts of pesticides come through

33
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,500
because they have dirty extractors like

34
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,109
is whether you're doing closed-loop like

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,519
light hard carbon butane interaction or

36
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:55,259
you're recycling and recirculating

37
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,368
solvents whether you're doing like co2

38
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,289
extraction where you have this

39
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:00,718
closed-loop machine or distillation to

40
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:01,799
further purify that's the place where

41
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,269
the highest amount of across

42
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,030
accommodation for the pesticides is

43
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:08,639
coming from and so so you know organic

44
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,370
good farmers are almost getting pulled

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,349
into you know this dirty process because

46
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,289
it's like by the time somebody is making

47
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,549
extract sources a bunch of trim and then

48
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:18,810
concentrates it they don't know if the

49
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,430
pesticide that's in there is from the

50
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,140
farmer or from the dudes that they ran

51
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,959
right before and they didn't clean the

52
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,548
machine out yes yeah well that's where

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,259
that urine system would come in you know

54
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:31,650
it's like but have it applied to like

55
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:34,019
drift of culture too right yeah you know

56
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,599
like how practices drifted you know and

57
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:38,549
how clones drifted not just because not

58
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,180
all of us have free broadcast which I

59
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:41,579
mean I've

60
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,390
seen a crop duster on my Mountain right

61
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:47,879
you know but well no it's just to be

62
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:49,348
shocked if like my neighbor hired a crop

63
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:51,358
duster to come through and do something

64
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:53,098
so I'm not gonna get that type of drift

65
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:55,170
you know exposures to the Appalachian

66
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:57,238
thinks about what's happening to and how

67
00:02:55,169 --> 00:03:00,388
certain Greenbelt the Green Revolution

68
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,819
like areas of California that hasn't

69
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:05,250
been so beat up and guilt over sprayed

70
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:07,259
are almost gonna not necessarily be the

71
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,789
most beneficial places to grow so that's

72
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:10,979
why it going to moving into it and

73
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:13,679
especially now that the flower market is

74
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:16,259
dying the you know the oil market is

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,689
emerging you know we need to have a

76
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,310
unified parts per billion parts per

77
00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:22,739
trillion whatever the testing is it

78
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:26,098
needs to be fair I mean okay good the

79
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:29,730
uric is what's what's the acronym yeah

80
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:31,108
so uric you are EC it's it was an

81
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:33,718
academic created by the National Organic

82
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:35,459
Program to account for the fact that we

83
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:37,500
live in a toxic environment in certain

84
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,419
areas there's drift and and it that's

85
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,250
unavoidable and so it's unavoidable

86
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,739
residual environmental contamination and

87
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,598
it's and it's an exemption basically

88
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,930
that the the National Ganic program

89
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,608
allows organic certified crops to still

90
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,709
pass in the marketplace as organic as

91
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:56,069
long as less than five percent of the

92
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:58,079
EPA allowed level of pesticide for that

93
00:03:56,068 --> 00:04:00,119
same crop so even though this is organic

94
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,040
and you can't use pesticides because of

95
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,289
drift you know safe or something like

96
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,358
michael--ah butanol or eagle 20 which is

97
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:08,280
commonly approved for grapes and berries

98
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,949
you know if you're organic certified

99
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,469
grape berry farmer you know and you know

100
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,600
there's their very real reality that you

101
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:17,160
know it's a drift happens and it

102
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,290
you know if one if the your neighboring

103
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,090
farmer sprays and there's winds and

104
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,850
carries over to your farm you still have

105
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,409
to be able to do be able to work and do

106
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,640
what you're trying to do and so to your

107
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,640
point I think it's such a big one

108
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,439
because you know from testing standpoint

109
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,849
we you know there's there never there's

110
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,740
never been any states that put in any

111
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,240
you know proposed limits for these

112
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,579
different pesticides you know we just

113
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,819
when we started testing you know back in

114
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,589
2010 we knew that you know there's these

115
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,329
specific compounds people were using and

116
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:46,409
they needed to be tested for and if

117
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:48,629
you're not testing for these specific

118
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,010
pesticides and - IDEs and fungicides and

119
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:51,959
you're kind of not really you know

120
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:53,849
offering much to somebody who's selling

121
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,129
pesticide test tube and so so then all

122
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,260
of a sudden Oregon came in and took the

123
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,149
list expanded the list and then they

124
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,339
created proposed limits that will

125
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:04,709
disqualify somebody if it's above this

126
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,419
certain limit so Oregon's limits we

127
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,769
thought we're the strictest had that had

128
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,199
ever come about all of a sudden

129
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:12,329
California in that emergency bill that

130
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,939
was just passed where they they put out

131
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:17,819
proposed limits and they went basically

132
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,800
20 times stricter than Oregon so in

133
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:22,889
Oregon where Michael beaten all eagle 20

134
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,520
is regulated at 0.2 ppm which is 200

135
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:28,409
part per billion California went to

136
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:31,799
regulated to ten part per billion so

137
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:34,590
point zero one so about 20 times more

138
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,220
sensitive amount you know just to

139
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:41,579
clarify sort of look at general

140
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:43,770
agricultural best practices yeah you

141
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:45,539
know Oregon the way they they looked at

142
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:47,399
all the compounds on the list you know

143
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,290
they looked at their you know they did a

144
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,969
lot of research into the toxicology data

145
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,980
of the different pesticides and

146
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,990
compounds and you know how they interact

147
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,550
with aquatic life and you know all these

148
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,769
things and then they they rated I'm on

149
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,629
these levels of like most concerning -

150
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:03,240
least concerning and then you know they

151
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:05,519
kind of they arbitrarily created the

152
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,750
limited action limits more based on the

153
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,430
labs up in Oregon

154
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,500
ability to pick up at those certain

155
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,019
amounts more than you know anything else

156
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,699
is really substantial and so so

157
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:15,990
California kind of went way and the

158
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,339
other direction went stricter than you

159
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,170
could have ever gone and so it's very

160
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:21,409
problematic is like from our perspective

161
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,310
a lot of the regulations around

162
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,290
microbiology I think they nailed it on

163
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,240
because they didn't regulate or they

164
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:30,530
took off things like aerobic bacteria

165
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,550
and yeast and mold levels from being

166
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:34,859
disqualifications and they more focused

167
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,600
on the pathogenic bad harmful microbes

168
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,280
like certain Aspergillus that brings

169
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,750
Micro toxins so we think they didn't

170
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,489
really get rid like certain other

171
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,410
testing regulations but with the

172
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,930
pesticides that went way too far so if

173
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,310
anything we're trying to lobby to have

174
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,829
the state recognized that there's a

175
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,629
happy medium you know where you you know

176
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:53,668
you create a zero tolerance policy which

177
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:55,589
essentially did having each pesticide

178
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:57,439
regulated at ten to twenty part per

179
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:59,939
billion which is such small I mean

180
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,040
residue amount you know all of a sudden

181
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:05,699
they're gonna make it almost impossible

182
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,830
to grow or in certain geographic areas

183
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,149
where there's a lot of high AG you know

184
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:12,478
because you know if they don't account

185
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:14,609
for and allow for this drift reality you

186
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,918
know by by by almost elevating the

187
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,560
limits of from ten part per billion to

188
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,060
maybe fifty eighty part per billion you

189
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,079
know then what they're gonna do is

190
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,579
they're gonna create too strict of a

191
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,228
system that's gonna put too many farmers

192
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:27,599
you know essentially out of business

193
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:29,939
consider well I mean you know I would I

194
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,830
would argue though to say that we don't

195
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,228
have that drift issue where we've been

196
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:36,569
farming for decades and that the drift

197
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:37,649
issue is happening in areas where there

198
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,790
should be anyway

199
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:41,579
they're you shouldn't be growing anyway

200
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:44,040
very that and it's like so if they lose

201
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:47,969
out like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

202
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,620
shed a tear no honestly pet the

203
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,510
pesticide topic is where I'm most

204
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,069
passion and and you know because before

205
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:55,529
we open up the se labs I worked in the

206
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:57,819
hydroponic industry and I did a lot of

207
00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:00,119
kind of consulting ongoing consulting

208
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:04,509
integrated pest management and how to

209
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,639
properly get rid of and prevent pests

210
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:09,490
and pathology but you know people always

211
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,719
you know whatever are busy don't do

212
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,430
things they get lazy they don't follow

213
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,050
the protocols they have other people

214
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,699
taking care of the plants you know and

215
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,800
then they get an infested moment where

216
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,689
they this huge outbreak of bugs or huge

217
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,730
outbreak of like powdery and then it

218
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:23,350
puts them into this and scrupulous you

219
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,790
know space where they'll spray or what

220
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,129
have you and and so I don't really have

221
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,900
a whole lot of I mean I think I think in

222
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:31,389
this new brave new world of cannabis I

223
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:34,209
think it's only the most organic fully

224
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:36,189
intentionally farming kind of folks that

225
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,629
are gonna really make it cuz it's like

226
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,820
if you haven't gotten hit by broad mites

227
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:41,740
if you haven't gotten like I mean the

228
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,050
the time where people can get away with

229
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,700
spring systemics is gone now it's like

230
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:47,620
if you're you're in a certain area where

231
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,530
there's drift you're almost even Mike

232
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,570
you know like stoked that that's

233
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:55,000
happening right that were you know they

234
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:58,300
were getting away we're really setting a

235
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,970
benchmark for quality and for standards

236
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:04,269
I mean it's yes so something somewhat

237
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:07,060
unobtainable you know by you know by in

238
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:10,269
some regions right in our region like

239
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:12,069
I'm saying you know it's what we do have

240
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:15,429
an issue tell us where you're growing

241
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,810
like how are going to Mendocino and one

242
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,149
of the issues that I have in Mendocino

243
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:20,669
now

244
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:24,029
is those systemics being sprayed on

245
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:26,219
mom's right like that's that's the main

246
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:28,740
cause or people thinking that they can

247
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,230
spray systemics and veg I didn't throw I

248
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,299
didn't do it in Flour like nope your

249
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,610
shits dirty bro and look that's that's

250
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:37,529
that's really where we get it from this

251
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,560
place we're like we're seeing this we're

252
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:44,699
not seeing and we're seeing stuff go

253
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,529
from one lab to another to another and

254
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,390
testing positive and then possessing

255
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:49,679
negative two like I've been to this

256
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,600
mother figures issues yeah I've been on

257
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,059
such a roller coaster ride on my phone

258
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,430
the last like three days with stuff

259
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,019
that's getting batch tested and like oh

260
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,789
it didn't pass here but it passed there

261
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:01,529
oh wait hold on when they kicked this

262
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:03,659
back oh wait no wait they're gonna put

263
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:05,850
it through over here and it's like so

264
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,439
the Kansas is like a pinball right going

265
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,850
between all these different x-rays man

266
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,480
they got a guy with a transit van

267
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:16,019
basically sitting on like you know 101

268
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,720
traffic you know in 580 getting shit

269
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,000
between Oakland's and

270
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,170
like all these Sonoma you know getting

271
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,360
all these things like the different

272
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:24,799
places then they're saying oh no we'll

273
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,960
take it we'll take it we'll take it

274
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:31,009
but there's nothing there's no

275
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,570
unification it seems like right well you

276
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:34,639
know and I think that's me also one of

277
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:36,560
the greatest things about regulation

278
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:40,129
because you know if there's gonna be a

279
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,629
robust process of regulating how

280
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:44,090
cannabis is grown and how its processed

281
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:45,649
and produced you know there almost has

282
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,600
to be and California learned this in

283
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:50,629
Oregon learn this you have to almost

284
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,129
hold the labs to a higher level of

285
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:54,620
accountability than even the produces

286
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:57,080
processors and so so what California did

287
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,840
and what organ is they required in order

288
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,970
for lab to even operate or to have their

289
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,860
services offer available to the

290
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,529
community in the public they have to

291
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:09,409
have gone through full ISO accreditation

292
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:11,389
not just on their lab but on every

293
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:13,689
individual test they offer to the public

294
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:17,269
and then further they have to go through

295
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:20,930
routine quarterly proficiency testing

296
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:22,309
where the state gives you a spiked you

297
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:24,319
know solution with a bunch of different

298
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:26,479
pesticides in it or a bunch of different

299
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,900
terpenes and cannabinoids and you have

300
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,279
to be able to pick up in this blank you

301
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,569
know in this in this completely unknown

302
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,669
mixture you have to be able to pick out

303
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,500
out the levels that the states are going

304
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:38,120
to be running to show that you can even

305
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,129
do that level testing and so that that's

306
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,860
the prerequisite is lobster so so I

307
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:44,120
think you know your frustration I think

308
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,919
is one of the biggest frustrations the

309
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,690
market is like how do you know who's

310
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,789
correct you know it's like you send you

311
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,110
some samples to all these different labs

312
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:52,819
and all these different labs different

313
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,930
results but it's like the lab testing is

314
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,360
a really complex thing cause it's like

315
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:58,219
is you know how old is the mass

316
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,840
spectrometer being used to test or pick

317
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,340
up pesticides you know it's like if it's

318
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,230
ten years old it might be picking it up

319
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,910
at ten Parker

320
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,860
you know as opposed to some of the newer

321
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:07,600
instrumentation that you know it picks

322
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,340
it up it you know - did - part per

323
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,019
billion level you know and and then you

324
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,509
know it's it and then I think I think

325
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:16,179
it's it's a the way that you can figure

326
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:18,009
it out as you know as as a client of lab

327
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:20,199
services you know it's like you can do a

328
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:21,429
bunch of blind testing on a lab you know

329
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,540
cuz if you know I think you're setting

330
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:23,589
yourself up for failure unless by

331
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,449
testing with a bunch of different labs

332
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,250
and expecting the lab results to ever

333
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,629
kind of really come online but if you

334
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,559
can do a bunch of testing internally

335
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:34,419
with each lab sending Neos you the same

336
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,519
samples labeled many different things

337
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:38,229
tested you know over a period of a few

338
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,059
weeks you know you can start to see

339
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,670
where and how often the lab hits the

340
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,019
bull's eye you know and and I think it's

341
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:45,819
a really important thing you know in

342
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:47,799
this lead up to regulation wall you know

343
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,180
people are choosing which lab works and

344
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,939
what lab is consistent and repeatable

345
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:53,379
and precise because unfortunately at

346
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,980
this moment there's not a labs out not a

347
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:58,960
lot of labs that are and so yeah so I

348
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,210
think that's a big problem that's gonna

349
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,280
you know mate really get alleviated with

350
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,240
regulation because you know the labs are

351
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,309
gonna be held to an account that they've

352
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,269
never had to be you know most laps in

353
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:12,219
the United States haven't had to be yeah

354
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:15,309
I think it will help to make it apples

355
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,600
to apples comparison among the labs you

356
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:17,979
know but but then the other thing kind

357
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,720
of is gonna mention about just the

358
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,039
passes I think into concentrations

359
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,350
one of the really interesting thing is

360
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,730
about pesticide residues you know

361
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,190
because I I used to work with in the

362
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,320
hydroponic industry and there's you know

363
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,690
a lot of common misinformation about you

364
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,850
know how long certain pesticide residues

365
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:37,920
would last residually in the plant and

366
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:42,449
so and you know and a lot of really good

367
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:45,298
even even trying to do the right thing

368
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:46,558
type farmers you know have in some way

369
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:47,789
or another in the past you know kind of

370
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:49,769
fallen victim to giving you an

371
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:51,269
infestation in some way and and and we

372
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:53,909
have resorted to using systemic

373
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:55,259
pesticides you know I mean I I would

374
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:56,818
wonder if you ever have you might not

375
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,438
have you know and that's amazing that

376
00:13:56,818 --> 00:14:00,028
shows how that shows on the level you're

377
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,558
on but but what's really interesting is

378
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:04,230
you know there's always been this calm

379
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:06,749
and misconception that pesticide

380
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,089
residues like eagle 20 or flora might or

381
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:11,369
avid you know lasts like thirty to sixty

382
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:13,410
days and then they're gone and you know

383
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:15,209
just to kind of expand on the complexity

384
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:16,789
of the conversation you know one of one

385
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,719
of the biggest things that breaks down

386
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,428
pesticide residues whether they're

387
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,759
organic pesticide residues or these

388
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:26,999
systemic kind of you know Dow Syngenta

389
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,678
Bayer type pesticides you know is the UV

390
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:31,168
spectrum from the Sun so it's like the

391
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:33,838
UV a B and C spectrum from Sun grown

392
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:35,938
cannabis from the exposure of Sun to

393
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,769
your plants is one of the major things

394
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:40,678
that breaks down and determines how

395
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:42,178
quick a residue breaks down and so so

396
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:44,548
you know whenever people are talking

397
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:46,078
about how long these pesticide residues

398
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:47,999
stick around in mom plants and then

399
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,368
clones that people are cutting you know

400
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:53,548
in so many ways it become it comes from

401
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:54,689
people growing mothers in door

402
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:57,480
you know because whenever you have a

403
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:59,338
mother plant that's indoor under high

404
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,409
pressure sodium or metal halide lighting

405
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,860
you know most of lighting up to this

406
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:05,129
point

407
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,860
that's indoor lighting is is void an

408
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:09,899
absent of UV a B or C you know some of

409
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,209
the newer indoor technology lighting

410
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,009
like plasma lighting well is starting to

411
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:16,318
bring in certain UV spectrum certain

412
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:19,459
LEDs now are bringing in certain UV

413
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:22,738
spectrum but largely most indoor grown

414
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:25,378
cannabis are lighting exposed to kind of

415
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:27,538
the plant growing indoor is lacking UV

416
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,459
and so therefore you know what we see at

417
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:32,519
the lab is you know it's incredibly

418
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:34,498
extended pesticide residues basically on

419
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,288
mothers you know ranging anywhere from

420
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:38,519
six months to a year after you know is

421
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:40,539
originally used and that's what's

422
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,870
getting a lot of

423
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:45,088
they're sourcing phones from these

424
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,589
mother treated or these these treated

425
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:49,110
mothers that are grown under and you

426
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:51,510
know indoor lighting and so and so so

427
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,370
the residues that might the residue that

428
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:55,019
might kind of be broken down rapidly

429
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,549
outdoor you know kind of if anything

430
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,379
just stays down much longer you know

431
00:15:56,549 --> 00:16:00,479
well it's also like I said you know

432
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:03,000
saying earlier it's not just the the

433
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,259
farmers practices it's the firmest

434
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,870
purchases right just a farmer purchasing

435
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:12,720
plants receive surgery oh man I need to

436
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:15,000
do this run and then what ends up

437
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,310
happening is you know we end up having

438
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,110
to get full batch testing right as I say

439
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:23,579
I mean you have a greenhouse filled with

440
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,580
the 250 plants and 50 of it came from

441
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,190
your farm

442
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,379
children came from various farms around

443
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:32,830
the county around the ridge you know

444
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:34,990
it's like you have you're susceptible to

445
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,370
whatever right and then the trim room it

446
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,990
all goes in the trim room it's already

447
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,089
trimmed up it's all getting thrown in

448
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:43,959
garbage bags I'll get in tight you know

449
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:46,420
and send down and one small you know one

450
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:50,349
batch testing positive for my feet off

451
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:52,569
might contaminate your entire arm and

452
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,870
kick your whole farm out you know you

453
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:58,000
know sale so you're like so you know

454
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,600
that's that's for our biggest issues

455
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,720
right now it's like you know how do we

456
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:07,240
educate the farmers into separating the

457
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,240
trim out from each batch how do we you

458
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,609
know you know if you're not sure that

459
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,759
that clone is pesticide free you know

460
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:18,159
like can we get that can we get on it

461
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:21,039
and you can test like before you commit

462
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,050
also so much into growing those plants

463
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,759
out you know like we test the leaf of a

464
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:25,869
clone or what have you you know that's

465
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:28,058
when you'll see pesticide concentrations

466
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,769
at the highest point they'll be also if

467
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:31,210
they've been treated you know and so

468
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:32,589
it's I mean what you're describing those

469
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,759
in so many ways it's fascinating cuz I

470
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:36,308
think regulation on cannabis

471
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,720
particularly around pesticides you know

472
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:39,940
know crop has ever been regulated

473
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,789
cannabis is about to be on pesticides as

474
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,679
strict limits as pesticides and Logan

475
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:47,109
and water and everything you know and

476
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,280
it's so fast into you because you know I

477
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:50,589
really feel like it's gonna reinforce

478
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,509
you know these this you know kind of

479
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:53,799
slow food movement ideal is like we're

480
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:56,379
talking about earlier of like you know

481
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:59,200
source can control and identification

482
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,120
you know I mean knowing knowing your

483
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,890
farm you know having the connection to

484
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,329
where your clones are coming from having

485
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,850
the connection to where your sourcing

486
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:08,769
your compost you know it's like it's it

487
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:11,079
you can no longer be detached from these

488
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:13,359
things you know or just have faith that

489
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:15,250
it's all going to be good because you

490
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,299
know it's organic you know cuz and you

491
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,220
know even on the pesticide thing it's

492
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:20,740
like I think it regulations are really

493
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,799
gonna be breeding and raising up such a

494
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:26,490
new caliber and quality of farmer you

495
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:28,710
know that's that is so precise on you

496
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:31,319
as medicine to the perfect of a perfect

497
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:34,110
you know perfect ability of it itself

498
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:36,058
and you know and and III wonder have you

499
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:37,439
have you guys heard of this it's a

500
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:38,609
syndrome except for one of the first

501
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,529
negative things that's happened with

502
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:41,969
cannabis and ret in regulated states

503
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:45,750
it's called cannabis hyperemesis

504
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:47,910
syndrome it's this really else is coming

505
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,679
our way I'll do this really weird rate

506
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,090
it's really well it's it but it's it's a

507
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,740
thing that's happening from improper

508
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:55,409
organic farming right so so basically

509
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,960
cannabis hyperemesis is this it's so

510
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,720
certain patients that well in inhale or

511
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,519
utilize cannabis we'll all of a sudden

512
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,929
have to go to hospital from this thing

513
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,000
that they're calling like this cyclical

514
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:07,350
vomiting syndrome so they'll just like

515
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,089
throw up and the count stop throwing up

516
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:13,109
and one of the only things against that

517
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:15,299
can chill the you know the reaction

518
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:16,889
whatever is happening even when they go

519
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:19,500
to the hospital is like if you figured

520
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,330
if they go into a hot shower or you get

521
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,859
exposed to hot hot water you know that

522
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:24,899
typically will mellow out some of these

523
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:27,269
the things that are happening from this

524
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:31,590
condition but what's really fascinating

525
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:33,900
is all of this specific you know kind of

526
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:35,549
side effects that are happening from you

527
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,840
know from this this condition that

528
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,599
people are attributing a cannabis now

529
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,069
that's this unknown in all these states

530
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:45,000
identically mirror what's known in India

531
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:47,849
as neem oil poison and and so so so as a

532
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,069
doctrine as a doctrine is a concentrate

533
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:52,289
off of neem oil so it so it's like it's

534
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:53,700
an isolated compound from neem oil that

535
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:56,039
what has with some of the more in

536
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,420
insecticidal properties and it's Omri

537
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,200
listed organic materials review

538
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,600
Institute

539
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,980
you know it's labeled as you know yeah

540
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,750
that you're able to spray it up to day

541
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,930
of harvest you know and we're not

542
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,460
talking about a leafy green

543
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:09,100
you know it's that you spray as a

544
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,200
doctrine like in the form of as a saw or

545
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:12,459
as a max you can't use as a troll

546
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,750
anymore because it just got pulled off

547
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,539
the market even though it's an organic

548
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:19,089
listed it had like these four unlabeled

549
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:21,279
pesticides in it you know yeah yeah so

550
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,209
as a trawl just got pulled off in Oregon

551
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,009
because it had like all these

552
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:28,240
pyrethroids and like some other

553
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:28,839
pesticides in new players so there is

554
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,309
organic

555
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:31,359
chrysanthemum fighters droids but then

556
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:34,299
there's all these synthetic pyrethroids

557
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,329
also but but you know but then there was

558
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:39,190
a chemical called pylon in there too but

559
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:40,449
but anyway the you know just I think

560
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,370
that just kind of shows it boiling

561
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,350
yep again it's great that Paganica is a

562
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:46,479
chrysanthemum extracted pyrethrin

563
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:47,769
organic listed everything's good but you

564
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,930
know it's like you can use that at time

565
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:50,950
where it shows up still you know but but

566
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,299
I think you know the big thing I was

567
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,890
talking about me more I was like you

568
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:55,089
know this new caliber farmer it's like

569
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,390
because not only are you not allowed to

570
00:20:55,089 --> 00:21:02,470
use the conventional stem expres that

571
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:04,870
big farm has used big AG as used to grow

572
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,850
mono crop agriculture you are no longer

573
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:08,589
allowed to use those because they're so

574
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,689
regulated you might even see them if

575
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:13,329
your neighbor spray them right and so so

576
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,789
then you as a farmer are only able to

577
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:17,379
use like these organic approaches

578
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:18,940
towards keeping with pests and pathology

579
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,110
which is just this whole body of

580
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,450
awareness and integrated pest management

581
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:24,549
that you know I think is really what

582
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,480
defines you know you know everything you

583
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,369
were talking about the regenerative

584
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,349
farming it's like looking to nature for

585
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,119
a more efficient design and creating is

586
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:33,039
perfecting like the environment you give

587
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,599
it so that you can naturally keep it

588
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,159
away and I think that's really what's

589
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:38,079
going to define the new farmers and also

590
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,390
that you you know it's it even organic

591
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,549
products you can use improperly you

592
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,800
spray neem oil on the plants before

593
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:45,548
harvest you know you might actually do

594
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,528
harm

595
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:49,118
and this kind of hyperemesis things in

596
00:21:47,528 --> 00:21:53,638
no joke you know and it's crazy that's

597
00:21:49,118 --> 00:21:58,480
from an organic pesticide even that yeah

598
00:21:53,638 --> 00:21:59,678
you know like I see so much of what it

599
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,819
is that we're doing is regenerative

600
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,798
farmers that's a duty their tools are to

601
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:07,898
to create these standards along the

602
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:10,720
lines of Virginia farming practices

603
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:14,048
there all of these things they're just

604
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,179
seemingly unfair coming down from these

605
00:22:14,048 --> 00:22:17,888
regulated you know regulatory agencies

606
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:21,609
and these regulatory bodies they never

607
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:23,678
grow cannabis never never and you know

608
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:26,678
it's kind of like this mentality is like

609
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,180
oh they want to grow fine let them grow

610
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,680
but they have to do this and it's like

611
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,080
[Music]

612
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,880
you know the farmers are running into

613
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:37,579
these situations where we can't do

614
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,690
everything it is no right and what is

615
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:40,460
why you have to be realistic and that's

616
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,680
why we have to lobby the regulators and

617
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,569
you know the legislators to kind of do

618
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,519
it right because I mean you know I could

619
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:49,220
very much detrimental on the entire

620
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:51,619
community I'm gonna make it rain to

621
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,660
regulate so give me some specifics of

622
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:55,759
proposed legislation that you're looking

623
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,620
at and say that's totally unfair like

624
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,809
what are some of the specifics that you

625
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:03,399
disagree with and what would you like it

626
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:06,649
to say instead as far as what I see as a

627
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,340
weed hustler you know saying that's had

628
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:13,070
to shift from flour sales to trim sales

629
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:16,309
that it really sucks

630
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:18,679
what's what what the guy on the other

631
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:20,720
side of me is able to do to go to

632
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,269
different labs go to her things take all

633
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,110
of my products run all of it offer me

634
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:29,269
$15 a pound if it tests positive or you

635
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:30,349
know yeah it's like it's it's ridiculous

636
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:31,369
and all they have to do is show me a

637
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:33,259
test result God knows where that

638
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:35,000
Testament came from brick thank you

639
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:36,680
they'd have the same test result for the

640
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,750
same dude the test is positive positive

641
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,970
you know saying and just ship it off to

642
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,099
everyone else and just you know cut copy

643
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,920
and paste negative test results we don't

644
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:48,379
know where farmers right uh damn of shit

645
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,710
tested positive what am I gonna do and

646
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:53,960
so the regulations that I see and what

647
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,720
Alec was talking about earlier being so

648
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:02,680
stringent being possibly ten parts per

649
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,680
billion on residuals like that's

650
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,600
it's not just trips like I said we're

651
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,910
talking about being a cultural trip

652
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:11,009
right thank you feels like cultural

653
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:14,160
drift syndrome where you know just

654
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:15,599
something happened right whether or not

655
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,250
it's a little bit of p.m. whether or not

656
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,250
you know what is that specified what

657
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:23,220
whatever it is like to be regulated at

658
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:26,220
that degree with with very room a little

659
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:29,789
room or I mean if I take my stuff to go

660
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:32,250
to a refinement process and lose half a

661
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:34,649
micron I have my crop it half of that

662
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:37,769
sale will go down and hunters are fine

663
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:39,929
all everything all the residuals out and

664
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:41,700
so I went from saying oh I'm gonna make

665
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:43,440
ten thousand dollars off this little

666
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,120
trip to five thousand dollars off the

667
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,039
soda trip and I've got to split that two

668
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,019
ways and then you know and that's his

669
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,970
two ways on the other so everyone's

670
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:56,849
getting like 1,200 bucks and all because

671
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,789
one lab tested positive so these are the

672
00:24:56,849 --> 00:25:07,289
issues I'm seeing personally as a

673
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:09,240
distributor you know for appellations of

674
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:12,119
origin and Oakland for appellations of

675
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,039
origin is you know we are going to

676
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:18,449
strive to have our own sets of standards

677
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:21,629
to raise the bar head-over-heels above

678
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:26,850
where the hand or hand above where the

679
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:29,340
state is right but we have to have local

680
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:31,949
hubs and processing facilities run by

681
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:35,220
local manufacturers that's my standard

682
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:37,980
never seems out either and then a run by

683
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,789
cooperating what's going on we have to

684
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,069
have testing labs within our

685
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:43,809
another nothis se coming up in setting

686
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:46,629
up shop and these hubs and processing

687
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:47,889
facilities as a partnership agreement to

688
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,500
some of these you know larger

689
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:54,870
collectives or cooperatives the the idea

690
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:57,220
is that we have our we have to have the

691
00:25:54,869 --> 00:26:00,639
manufacturing the extraction industry

692
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:04,180
more accountable alright for the testing

693
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,550
right and for the responsibility to the

694
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:08,500
farmers for getting back fair pricing at

695
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:11,049
the end of the day like I don't grow

696
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,970
trim so finding is it but if I'm not

697
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:15,339
growing flower and I'm selling trim and

698
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:18,400
it's always coming back positive or

699
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:21,879
something I'm not making money either so

700
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,710
that's know a big time you know and and

701
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,360
you know and when it's so many ways to

702
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,910
get the most frequent conversation I

703
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:31,209
have like with people that we work with

704
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:33,370
within this testing community you know

705
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,539
so largely is around the pesticide topic

706
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:36,609
you know and and it's really fascinating

707
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:38,769
cuz you know a lot of a lot of my

708
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:40,119
mentors and you know the Giants whose

709
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:42,639
shoulders I'm standing on who I've

710
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:45,639
learned from you know people like Tim

711
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,320
Blake up in Mendocino County you know so

712
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,700
many people I know up in the Emerald

713
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:50,200
triangle like I've been doing this

714
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,720
generationally with their families you

715
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,850
know almost have this existential fear

716
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,339
that you know with regulations you know

717
00:26:54,849 --> 00:27:00,159
this could come this big AG model that's

718
00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:01,990
gonna come and smash the price of herb

719
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,120
and so many people are gonna lose in the

720
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,190
love livelihoods you know but but you

721
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:08,109
know if truly in so many ways like I you

722
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:10,330
know it's unlike romantic perspective

723
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:12,699
you know I see I see the regulations

724
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:16,149
like cannabis or you know I mean I think

725
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,890
that we have to get Urich recognized

726
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,240
this unavoidable residual they have

727
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,430
passed the limits have to get a little

728
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,720
bit raised you know but but but in

729
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,039
general I think the best aside

730
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,690
regulations as strict as they are

731
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:27,609
they're gonna most benefit the small

732
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,019
medium scale Appalachian kind of

733
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:31,149
mom-and-pop farmer who's been doing this

734
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:33,069
forever because you know it's like if

735
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,259
you've done this for 20 years and you've

736
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:37,539
gotten smashed by broad mites and you

737
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:39,799
have seen thrip infestation to its worst

738
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:41,389
and aphids and all these things

739
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:42,769
and you know and you're able to

740
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,350
understand how to grow and your

741
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:46,910
microclimate region without being

742
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:48,769
reliant on systemic use you know

743
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,420
fungicides to keep away powdery mildew

744
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:52,009
you have this almost built-in level of

745
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,009
insulation you know that I think is

746
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:56,990
going to be your biggest benefit in the

747
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:59,329
regulated market cuz like as the ships

748
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:01,880
over and there's this transition to

749
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:03,769
where you know only clean we will

750
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,080
eventually be allowed into dispensaries

751
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:07,670
and and and and you know and the whole

752
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,949
thing start shifting I think I think

753
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:11,570
there's an incredible crisis of scarcity

754
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,950
of clean material on the market right

755
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:14,569
now whereas there's an abundance of

756
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,250
dirty wheat and you know I you know

757
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:18,139
California you know the amount of weed

758
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,690
this ground here you know 80 to 90

759
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,340
percent of I'd say is going out of state

760
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,809
and probably well for a long time you

761
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:25,579
know even though there's a comprehensive

762
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:27,529
regulated market model Mike it's gonna

763
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:29,149
stop but the thing is is like I think

764
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:31,369
those that participate in the regulated

765
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:33,800
space you know I think all the big money

766
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:35,779
like johnny-come-lately folks that are

767
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:37,009
just coming in with all this VC money

768
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:38,329
thinking they're with all their

769
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:39,829
projections and their illusions of

770
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:41,599
grandeur about how much they're gonna

771
00:28:39,829 --> 00:28:43,909
crush it I think are gonna be the first

772
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,619
crushed because it's like if you don't

773
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:49,190
have this humble reverence for the plant

774
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:50,750
and then being a steward and a servant

775
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,390
of the plant and like have learned the

776
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,039
lessons to do it right I mean because is

777
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:57,170
the the time where you could get away

778
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,119
with you know identifying you at broad

779
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:01,700
mites you know three weeks into flower

780
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,619
and you're facing potential entire crop

781
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,630
loss where some farmers back in the day

782
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:07,669
would bomb their room with a nuclear

783
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:10,100
option you know it's some pesticide like

784
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:11,960
forbid or you know these different Bayer

785
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:13,759
chemicals or whatever it's like the time

786
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,170
where that could have actually you know

787
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,170
gotten away with its going

788
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:33,819
