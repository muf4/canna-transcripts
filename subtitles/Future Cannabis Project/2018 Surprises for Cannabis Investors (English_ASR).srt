1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,569
from an investor's standpoint think the

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:04,949
most surprising thing was the the amount

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,048
of capital that was being poured into

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,550
Canada and the amount of capital that

5
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,620
Canada was pouring back into the United

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,200
States I think the last couple of years

7
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:15,509
the expectation was that most the deal

8
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,579
flow is going to be dominated by the

9
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,289
private equity firms here in the US the

10
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,570
guys had large pools of capital they put

11
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,490
together specifically to back cannabis

12
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,839
based businesses and they thought that

13
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:26,278
their competition for deal flow was

14
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,679
largely going to exist between private

15
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,448
equity funds what ended up happening is

16
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,429
that after some of these Canadian

17
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,620
companies ended up with you know

18
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:36,509
sometimes billions of dollars of capital

19
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:37,949
is sitting there they're creating

20
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,320
special opportunities funds and those

21
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,609
special opportunities funds we're now

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,350
competing for deal flow and they also

23
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,750
had the advantage of being able to use

24
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,820
their paper as when I say their paper

25
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,420
their stock as a way to purchase some of

26
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,230
these companies

27
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,520
so from an M&amp;A perspective so much the

28
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:55,439
deal flow went to the Canadian

29
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,879
businesses and then there's also

30
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,769
Canadian businesses that are formed

31
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,659
specifically for the purpose of

32
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,820
acquiring US assets you know companies

33
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:07,469
such as cantarella tea which is now

34
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,420
called origin house or c21 or i anthis

35
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:11,579
those companies start coming to the US

36
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,640
and using a combination of cash in stock

37
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,989
to to put together large portfolios of

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,319
US businesses and I don't think that

39
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:22,849
anyone in 2017 expected how much capital

40
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:22,849
come out of the Canadian market that way
