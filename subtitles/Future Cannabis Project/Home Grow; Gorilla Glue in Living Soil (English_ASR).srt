1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,560
hey here's an update on the gorilla glue

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,839
and the five by nine tent

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:10,000
it's coming down here um got the cuts

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,798
from a buddy

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,240
um this is the second run i had with

6
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,118
them the first run i had in the four by

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,519
four tent um

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:22,399
they're kind of a trickier strain to

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:25,518
grow for me at least

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:28,399
they were really heavy feeders

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,198
i smashed them because the first run you

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,678
know

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,760
i noticed that so i tried to correct for

14
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:37,280
that on this run

15
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:40,479
so i smashed them with some foliars from

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,160
uh organics alive

17
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,878
and nature's pride green aminos so but

18
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,799
still

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,558
these these uh three beds on the right

20
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,959
started showing deficiencies there uh

21
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,640
pretty early even though i kept on the

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,679
the foliars and even up the

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,039
dosage too um

24
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:03,679
but this bad i think um when i was going

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,118
through my notes

26
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,959
i saw that because these two beds

27
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,920
weren't set up initially it was just

28
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,359
these two so when i set this one up i

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,600
didn't have enough soil in it and i

30
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,200
started growing cover crops

31
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,640
so i let them grow for a little bit i

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,520
chopped them down

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,799
and then covered it with uh some compost

34
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,158
and some more soil

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,479
and then that's when i planted these

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,880
girls in them so uh

37
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,560
i think all that active decomposition

38
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,599
and stuff because this plant just blew

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,879
up leafs everywhere you know just

40
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,239
huge compared to everything else fox

41
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,759
tails and everything

42
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,519
so i think that had something to do with

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,079
it but um

44
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,560
yeah overall man they're just uh heavy

45
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,559
feeders

46
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,719
um oh yeah what i learned

47
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,000
not every strain is the same some

48
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,078
strains are going to eat more than

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
others you know some are going to be you

50
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,639
know prefer a different environment than

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
others prefer more water less water

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,759
you know that's why we use these tools

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,959
that we like to buy from the grill store

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,239
and stuff

55
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,919
to monitor those things but um oh yeah

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,959
another thing i learned keep the trellis

57
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,878
on point

58
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,719
i didn't know the gorilla glue would

59
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,840
stretch this much

60
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,280
so when i put the trellis up um they

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,959
didn't stop i mean i flowered them when

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,159
they were like at the first trellis you

63
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,759
know and

64
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,840
that's how big they got even with me

65
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,878
stretching them all over the place

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,479
trying to keep them keep them down so i

67
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,679
guess just try to know how much your the

68
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,719
string you're growing

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,080
stretches um

70
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,919
because that that's that was an issue

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,319
for me with the trellis and keeping the

72
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,000
trellis on point is uh is huge it's

73
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,518
really huge

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,519
um ipm always ipm didn't have any

75
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,360
problems this run thank god but

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,560
i did um listen to brandon russ talk

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,480
on the future cannabis project and he

78
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,000
was talking about the bavaria basiana

79
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,840
and i had already been looking into that

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,239
about a year ago i just never got it

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,800
and when he mentioned it i i went out i

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,599
ordered it so i got some of that coming

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,719
um the dr zymes you know and then the

84
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,199
extract sprays

85
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,199
and stuff

86
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,079
uh yeah i would have used different

87
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,238
cover crops

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,080
like a more diverse blend as well

89
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,840
we just want that diversity all those

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,120
different cover crops would be released

91
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,640
in different exit dates waking up

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,519
different sets of microbes in the soil

93
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,759
getting that

94
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,879
that cycling going on but the rye just

95
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:37,199
kind of went out of control

96
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:37,199
um

97
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,680
oh my grill media so in all the beds i

98
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,639
use

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,439
coasta maine the stonington blend and i

100
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,878
also added some malibu compost

101
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:54,000
to some of them um

102
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:57,120
and to others i'm pretty sure i added

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,479
um the lobster compost from coastal

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,000
maine as well even though it was already

105
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:04,560
in the stonington blend i just i really

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,560
like that stuff it smells great um

107
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,000
my lights i'm using the next light

108
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,598
course

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
i've really loved them so far they don't

110
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:17,439
put out a lot of heat at all

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,160
um yeah i mean i can leave them like six

112
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,120
inches above

113
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,880
the plant i just like them because the

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:29,840
heat because i'm growing intense

115
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:29,839
that's that's what matters to me

116
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,959
i got a six inch phantom filter

117
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,400
describe the smell because my girl

118
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,879
doesn't really like it in the house you

119
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,359
know

120
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,478
so got to take care of that that seems

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,199
to work

122
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,839
um also if you're growing intense

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,520
something big

124
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,879
is uh controlling the environment of the

125
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,079
room that you're in

126
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,000
so i got that dehu over there um

127
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,240
that's big like positioning that you

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,639
know so where i got it

129
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,400
the heat is blowing out towards that

130
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,439
wall right there so these two tents tend

131
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,719
to get hotter

132
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:05,519
and drier than this tank so

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,400
i gotta finagle it around um and then

134
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,839
you know

135
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,519
check the readings in all the tents and

136
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:13,439
then adjust that

137
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:15,279
dehumidifier accordingly um

138
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,478
that's huge controlling the temp because

139
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,239
then that you know

140
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,519
when you're sucking trying to get it dry

141
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,879
in the tents you're also jacking the

142
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,599
heat up in the room which is going to

143
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,240
increase the

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,919
heat and the tents but i don't like to

145
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,960
ever let the tents get over

146
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:32,478
60 percent humidity at night

147
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,239
but it's pretty hard growing intense

148
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,120
it's a big challenge if you can't just

149
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,319
get

150
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,879
one big tent or i mean throwing

151
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,560
multiple ones is is pretty difficult to

152
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,560
keep your environment on point

153
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,159
oh yeah i got these fans i need to get a

154
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,360
new oscillating fan i think sucks

155
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,080
but um the oscillating fans for

156
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,879
above the canopy for air movement and

157
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,560
this box fan down here i didn't like uh

158
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,079
no air movement down here at all so i

159
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,680
just keep it on low

160
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,279
and blow it through through down there

161
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,439
but i think that's why i stopped getting

162
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:11,519
mushrooms popping up

163
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:14,478
um oh yeah mark your beds

164
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,240
that's something i didn't do initially

165
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,719
if i could go back i would you know

166
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,519
definitely would and mark them all which

167
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,319
they now are

168
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,000
so that i can keep like meticulous notes

169
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,960
so now you know everything i've done to

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,478
here

171
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,399
i have to go through all these

172
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,439
handwritten notes and like some

173
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:35,839
uh like saved videos and stuff i have

174
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,839
so it's kind of a pain in the butt but

175
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,560
yeah i mean i talked about the gorilla

176
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,279
glue a little bit already but

177
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,199
they stretch a lot a lot a lot they're

178
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,959
heavy feeders

179
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,120
but i mean it's beautiful they're

180
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,120
they're super frosty especially this one

181
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,120
super frosty has the classic gorilla

182
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,120
glue smell

183
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,720
to me it's it's kind of like an og

184
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,680
undertone

185
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,680
which i love i love the ogs but um

186
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:17,680
some gnarly looking nugs over here

187
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,199
but you can see that i've been

188
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,120
de-fanning because they're coming down

189
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,720
here in a couple days but

190
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,800
you can see the deficiencies they had

191
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,479
um yeah like i said i would have hit him

192
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,038
with more

193
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,478
um like extracts i would have had a

194
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:33,598
different cover crop in there i got blue

195
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:34,959
mats going

196
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,199
you can see the line coming in from

197
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,198
there

198
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,759
that comes in splits and then the

199
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,038
eight millimeter tube is run in a circle

200
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,240
around

201
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,240
where it meets back here

202
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,038
i got a purge so i can purge out

203
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,840
um you know any air bubbles or anything

204
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,478
i run that

205
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,519
you know for like 30 seconds like once

206
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,279
or twice or

207
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,959
about once a week or once every two

208
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,839
weeks

209
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,638
um oh they're on the distribution

210
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,399
drippers

211
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,160
i think the soil kind of swallowed

212
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,519
everything but i usually leave them in

213
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,199
because if i take them out i don't

214
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,120
remember to hand water them and then

215
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,160
while the crops drying in here

216
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,240
so are the the beds because you know

217
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,080
when i chop it down i just hang them in

218
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,000
here to dry

219
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,598
so if i leave the blue mats in the

220
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,319
plants are gone they're in the dark so

221
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,000
they're not really drinking any water

222
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,080
but if i didn't have the blue mats they

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,879
wouldn't be kept topped off and they dry

224
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,278
out and

225
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,200
i don't want my soils to dry out for the

226
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,240
micro life and also for the worms and

227
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,278
stuff um

228
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,360
i don't think really two weeks of no

229
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,120
water they really dry out that much but

230
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200
just to be safe i leave it in there

231
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,720
but this time i will be taking them out

232
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,839
just so i can get out this rye grass

233
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,340
because it's

234
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,920
a son of a bitch to kill

235
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,680
[Music]

236
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:01,599
but yeah real glue it was fun

237
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,039
getting rid of it i don't have anything

238
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,320
behind it

239
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,159
any clones of it or anything i got about

240
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,360
six packs of seeds i gotta go through

241
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,360
that i'm pretty excited for

242
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,600
yeah thanks
