1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,569
[Music]

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,210
I'm Jamie for mendocino generations and

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,368
I'm interviewing Richard North from

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:20,880
Terre Vesco he they create vermicompost

5
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:22,589
and Burma extract and so can you tell me

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,028
a little bit about the company's history

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,899
and how you got started yeah sure

8
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,410
absolutely

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,089
we started about 25 years ago actually

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,299
working in the vineyard industry were

11
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,950
based in Sonoma so you know we had a

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,128
chance to work with the wine grape

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:42,530
growers about eight years ago ten years

14
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:42,530
ago cannabis guys found us and

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,000
the movement started growing the number

16
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,719
of people driving three four or five

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,780
hours each way wanted by our product we

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,350
grew and we've been expanding into the

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,829
cannabis market for the last five years

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:04,890
pretty rapidly yes we produce two

21
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,200
products they're both form based we have

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,530
over 60 million worms we produce

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,240
vermicompost and Burma extract the

24
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,259
reason why we use worms is to introduce

25
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:18,149
microbiology and into the products

26
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:21,859
microbiology allows plants to uptake

27
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:24,810
nutrients more efficiently and

28
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:27,209
translocate them so we see their root

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,420
systems greater percentage of prime root

30
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:33,298
hairs thicker stalks stronger laterals

31
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,769
bigger leaves higher yields right I

32
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,868
definitely saw that I mean I had some

33
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:38,849
six foot tall plants and two gallon pots

34
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:41,340
that had a bunch of your very very my

35
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:43,379
dog yeah yeah accident the root mass was

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,420
just incredible yeah so what makes your

37
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:46,769
product unique what we think it's a

38
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,109
microbiology or we know it's the

39
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,750
microbiology and actually we work with

40
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,939
the USDA and a lot of different research

41
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,700
projects and one of them was documenting

42
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,789
the suppression of agro bacterium with

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,590
human patients it's crown gall and in

44
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:03,170
that they discovered the levels of

45
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,379
microbiology that we have in the product

46
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:10,140
they've documented approximately 2,400

47
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:13,500
species of bacteria and over 300 species

48
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:15,449
of fungi so those numbers are off the

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,068
charts and they said that our product

50
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:18,899
even though it's organic certified we

51
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:21,479
have our army certification both in the

52
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,640
US and Canada our CV of a certification

53
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,560
as well as clean green certification

54
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,719
they said that even though our product

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,689
is organic certified it behaves like a

56
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,848
conventional agricultural product what

57
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:34,829
does that mean well the quality and

58
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:36,899
consistency are there so the results

59
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,360
that you get are consistent and

60
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,180
typically with organic products you can

61
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,360
see some variability from year to year

62
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:49,110
or batch to batch our product is high

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,450
consistent you know every every time not

64
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,250
only in its composition but its level of

65
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:55,799
microbiology and the results that it

66
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,409
delivers for crops

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,080
nice and so I know he said he use worms

68
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:03,689
what's the base that the worms great

69
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,410
questions so we use organic dairy manure

70
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:10,169
dairy cows we use their manure there's

71
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:11,699
actually rice hulls that are in the

72
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,069
product is that the bedding for the cows

73
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:17,579
at the dairy those are organic certified

74
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:19,829
as well they clean out the stalls it

75
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,620
goes into a collection pond goes through

76
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,469
a separator squeeze out a lot of the

77
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,300
extra liquids we receive it we go

78
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:29,159
through a thermophilic composting

79
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,520
process to get rid of weed seeds and

80
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,739
pathogens and then we feed it to 60

81
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,500
million worms and they're the ones that

82
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,330
do all the hard work for us the amazing

83
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,310
thing is that the density of the warm

84
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,219
population who's about a thousand worms

85
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,439
per cubic foot nothing like you'd ever

86
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:49,319
find in nature and that's what makes it

87
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,840
so exciting from the level of

88
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,069
microbiology that's you know included in

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,259
the problem right as well as the

90
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:58,139
diversity right yeah and then you also

91
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:59,340
do an extract of that low and so one of

92
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,119
the things that we were trying to figure

93
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,310
out is how to work with plants beyond

94
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,680
the transplant process or you know just

95
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,789
when one plants are babies you know how

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,180
can we work with them when they're

97
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:13,679
established in the field and so that's

98
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,259
where we came up with the idea of

99
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,269
extract a liquid that's derived from the

100
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:19,769
Burma compost where we separate the

101
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,079
microbes

102
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:25,250
from the organic matter and suspend them

103
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,460
in solution we created a process allows

104
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:31,740
small amount of microbiology that we

105
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:35,189
include in the product to support the

106
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,769
population for about sixty days so you

107
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:41,490
know the the microbes are still active

108
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:44,038
and then when they're you know utilized

109
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:47,879
in liquids for delivery and we talk

110
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:50,788
about a soil drench so up take it

111
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,860
systemically you know the efficacy is

112
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:54,569
fantastic right until you say it has

113
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,939
like the shelf life of about sixty days

114
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,860
yeah for the microbiology is that it for

115
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:02,459
sixty days so the sooner you use it the

116
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,189
you know all the better but actually we

117
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,870
have people that have used it for up to

118
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:11,038
nine months and seeing great efficacy

119
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,509
right as well and so yeah if you can use

120
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,490
it within the first 60 days that's

121
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:18,030
awesome right and so I know that your

122
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,728
your products were primarily biological

123
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:23,668
this yes so do they also have like an

124
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:27,180
NPK remember another great question so

125
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:29,069
the NPK of the vermicompost is 0.75

126
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,319
point seven five point seven very

127
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:33,060
balanced very balanced and but very low

128
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,149
you know we're not a we're not a

129
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,800
nutrient but we enable nutrients to be

130
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:39,779
up taken and translocated more

131
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,579
efficiently it's kind of like if you

132
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,829
know you and I take a multivitamin it

133
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:45,990
doesn't have magnesium in it you'll

134
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:47,668
expel most of what that vitamin contains

135
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,180
its minerals won't be absorbed by your

136
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:53,098
body but if you have magnesium in it

137
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,650
you're gonna absorb most of it right

138
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:56,310
well vermicompost is kinda magnesium for

139
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:58,019
plants

140
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,600
got and so the plants are getting more

141
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:02,219
readily absorb you know the the

142
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,379
nutrients that they need to be able to

143
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,190
grow and you know strong healthy

144
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:09,689
vigorous right and lower resistance of

145
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:13,170
infections of all that and feed the soil

146
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:14,969
feed the plant is more resilient helps

147
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,379
with the immune system of the plant and

148
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,120
absolutely yeah and actually you know

149
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:20,219
what we find is pretty interesting even

150
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,769
these during the really hot summers that

151
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:26,130
we see you know in Mendocino Humboldt

152
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:28,439
yes we see plants actually that are

153
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:30,930
treated with vermicompost or extract can

154
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:34,290
actually be more resilient

155
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,209
high heat events is that stomata on the

156
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,040
underside of the leaves actually become

157
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:39,539
more active and when they feel a stress

158
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,140
it clothes and they retain moisture

159
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,550
right yeah I mean I definitely noticed

160
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:44,969
definite on the recent health with the I

161
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,560
farm

162
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,270
awesome using your fright axes well

163
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,370
we're thrilled that you're a happy

164
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:53,939
customer yeah thank you so much I think

165
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:57,000
a man you so when you're talking about

166
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:59,910
mixing the compost in the soil mixtures

167
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,860
what kind of ratios you suggest so it

168
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,740
depends on what point of the process

169
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,319
we're talking about with babies and in a

170
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,410
potting mix ten percent is the most that

171
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,420
you need

172
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,520
when we're talking about transplants

173
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,560
actually putting the vermicompost in the

174
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,180
transplant all right so depending on the

175
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,939
size of the transmit like a four by four

176
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,310
might be a cup cup and a half in the

177
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:24,000
bottom of the transplant hole and then

178
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,860
actually top dressing around the plant

179
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,199
you know during the season maybe once or

180
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,139
twice you know working at the

181
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:36,069
vermicompost in again to provide a you

182
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:38,050
know sustainable and growing cycle for

183
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:39,430
the plant rising that microbiology yeah

184
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,230
you probably want to kind of after you

185
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,480
top dress cover it up a bit so it's not

186
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,370
absolutely it's just not dropping it on

187
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,470
right in walking away it's working

188
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,410
stretching to them or having the top

189
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,100
dress on top of it right so yeah

190
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,350
absolutely

191
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,689
yeah and of course using the extract and

192
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:57,490
what we find is we've gotten a lot of

193
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:59,319
feedback from growers this past year

194
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,720
we'll be updating our labels to reflect

195
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:05,589
this but you fifty milliliters per

196
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:08,560
gallon is a great you know fifteen fifty

197
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:11,439
five zero is a great application rate

198
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,209
our concentration ratio to use for the

199
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:17,319
extract and all the way from seed

200
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:19,149
cracking to pre-harvest and people are

201
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,860
actually micro dosing if they if they

202
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:22,719
feed several times a week they're

203
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,740
actually taking that number down to ten

204
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,240
or fifteen one five mils per gallon and

205
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,850
because it becomes really cost effective

206
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,849
yeah when you're you know using such low

207
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,529
dosages of the product and after 50 mils

208
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:38,080
per gallon rate like how often would you

209
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:39,309
suggest drenching with that no more than

210
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,840
once a week and then where the once a

211
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,668
week it could be every couple weeks I

212
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,320
think it's really every grower needs to

213
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:46,179
understand what strains are using what

214
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,470
you know what they're doing with the

215
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:49,449
weather conditions and things like that

216
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,970
and how they want to enhance the

217
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,340
efficacy yeah I probably has it has to

218
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,259
do also the oil media and what kind of

219
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,980
sort of using how healthy the soil is

220
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:02,220
and what challenge is your face yeah

221
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,139
so dialing in figuring that out is you

222
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,240
know what that's what small farmers do

223
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,399
right you know that's what we do we take

224
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,198
it off well it's definitely a wonderful

225
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,198
product and I really appreciate you guys

226
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:14,909
we've got Roger Klotz thank you future a

227
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:16,879
cannabis project thank you thank you

228
