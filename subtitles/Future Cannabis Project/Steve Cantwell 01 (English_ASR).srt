anyways 27 so yeah so don't mean

17
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:54,170
actually talking about building a brand

18
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,260
in the competitive market I'm some of

19
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,849
the absolute down to one to I need like

20
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:02,680
able to come prepare anything just go

21
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:02,679
over our story on some strong points

22
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,949
potentially avoid or you know kind of

23
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,569
tend towards so years ago have a kinda

24
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:14,239
can this way I was actually in a fighter

25
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:17,150
so I grew up like as a kid like most

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,620
people here probably welcome in to visit

27
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,719
an extra days I became a professional

28
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,180
athlete he chased this whole UFC dream

29
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:26,359
and picked up a lot of injuries on the

30
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,770
way got into canvas and then they had a

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,790
medical marijuana program some of the

32
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:33,530
California's we can apply for a

33
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:39,439
prescription but in Nevada it was crazy

34
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:43,509
hard to get any other freaking yeah

35
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:46,120
corner taxation is doctor's appointment

36
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:47,620
everything in your fingerprints done FBI

37
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,030
you can check all these crazy things to

38
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,219
get it once they're all defeated three

39
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,439
can visit and my personal garden for

40
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:55,060
years got really comfortable growing my

41
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:59,169
own really good cannabis evolved as a

42
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:02,439
grower from flood tables - Coco - soil

43
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:04,929
with nutrients - looking sorta amended

44
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:07,210
soil - living soil had my own little

45
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,900
personal evolution it was awesome

46
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,909
and then you can see that she comes for

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,289
them all the guys are coming to town I

48
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:15,879
was talking about you know this

49
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:17,949
corporate takeover and all this stuff

50
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,409
and and you similar to what California's

51
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:24,000
going through now this idea of be having

52
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:26,889
at home grow personal garden they're not

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,930
was slowly shrinking so I got nervous

54
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:31,119
and started putting together some

55
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,040
concept and how to run news on a larger

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,569
scale I got bigger than the four lights

57
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,090
I was running in my personal garden for

58
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:39,099
them sorry six likes so let's try put

59
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,390
together some ideas I bring into the

60
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:41,739
movie next oil over the years in

61
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:43,419
permaculture it was something I was

62
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:44,200
extremely passionate about so that I

63
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,849
could stand behind

64
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,768
I thought okay I'm gonna build my

65
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,900
company around that that's something I

66
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,310
want to really focus my brand on is

67
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,050
something that

68
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,939
and behind some people to stand behind

69
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,650
I'm something that she's bigger than me

70
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:58,689
so we really focused on that and the

71
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,110
whole regenerative movement so I said I

72
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:09,430
have a permaculture and then basically

73
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:11,110
putting together a local team together

74
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,300
in my hometown and from that I've no

75
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,620
small group that basically back in half

76
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,359
is saying let me do what I wanted to do

77
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,829
they basically they're a bunch of

78
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,418
construction contractors general

79
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,668
contractors so they built our whole

80
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:22,810
building out on the old days Hardware

81
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,269
completely renovated this rusty old

82
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,129
lumber yard into a state-of-the-art grow

83
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:28,389
okay again four years ago state of the

84
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:31,449
art nowadays I look at my grown it looks

85
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:35,110
like a dinosaur to me it's technology I

86
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:36,370
guess I don't know so anyway so we put

87
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,620
together this really cool local dream

88
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,329
team we build this really cool concept

89
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,370
around a living soil system of

90
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:44,259
regenerative movement and then we hit

91
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:47,019
the ground running four or five years

92
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:48,430
this was actually five years ago we

93
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:50,740
propped out our first crop about four

94
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,689
years ago and when we first opened up it

95
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,329
was a joke people thought we were the I

96
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:59,370
got so much slack from every single

97
00:04:55,329 --> 00:05:03,219
angle living soil living soil indoors

98
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:06,430
led everything you could possibly think

99
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,229
of no one thought would work but four

100
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,699
years later we're the only brand still

101
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:11,469
operating with the same ownership under

102
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:14,439
the same roof under the same everything

103
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,210
so it's definitely something there a

104
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,829
long time basically say it make sure if

105
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,969
you build a brand first of all build it

106
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:20,109
on something that you stand can stand

107
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:24,720
behind don't just building on some

108
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:26,530
random trend or sometimes AB or a strain

109
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,280
building on something that you can you

110
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:31,719
know definitely when days are bad that

111
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,909
you can definitely you know manage to

112
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,460
get through it because I guarantee right

113
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,710
now if you open up shop based off of you

114
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:40,089
know some trends some bad and you have a

115
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:43,269
hard day you're gonna be hitting the

116
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:46,299
road hard I guarantee it anyways back up

117
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:49,719
so we built up I grow out will

118
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,400
again fairly small my shipping you guys

119
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,419
are familiar with GLP but people tend to

120
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,529
think that were this really big

121
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,879
corporate bro

122
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:57,068
but no we're not we're just a really

123
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,009
small a fishing bro that would just keep

124
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:02,470
constantly a perpetual cycle going so

125
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:04,389
anyways so we built that bro we did a

126
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,400
whole living organic soil thing and we

127
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:07,780
stood by it I'm not sure if you guys

128
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,549
again are familiar with this but again

129
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:11,948
we're living organic soil indoors with

130
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,079
LEDs and one our sixteenth cycle I

131
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:16,629
preached a whole lot of water only and I

132
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:19,478
really truly mean it we do a lot of very

133
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:21,279
minimalistic with our nutrients we do a

134
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:25,240
lot of poly culture in our soil so we do

135
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:29,079
a lot of we run clover no more but a lot

136
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:33,009
of different dynamic accumulators that

137
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:35,709
conjure chickweed straw grasses rye

138
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,389
things like that as part of our soil

139
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:39,250
program a lot in England indoor guys

140
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,569
don't really truly do that and you see a

141
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,740
lot of guys running soil but they're

142
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:43,719
also running a bottle nutrient line

143
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,918
behind it so that's one thing that we

144
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,599
try and trade away from is we're going

145
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:48,818
to really keep it real again I want to

146
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:51,399
build my brand behind something real not

147
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:52,509
just some again some living soil fad

148
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:54,848
like you're trying to see people kind of

149
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:58,740
box you know against that's why I'm

150
00:06:54,848 --> 00:07:01,180
saying that so again we want to

151
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,710
everything that we do we do for real

152
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,168
I've worked with some of the best people

153
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:08,109
in industry from with Jonathan and his

154
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:09,490
crew to some of the best oil people some

155
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,439
of the best permaculturist

156
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,658
and put it all together under one roof

157
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,339
it's really gonna be key building a team

158
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:16,718
is going to be key if you're trying to

159
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:18,939
build a successful brand and be

160
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:20,709
competitive one of the things that I'm

161
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,810
really big on is having people that I

162
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:24,758
can play devil's advocate with I'm an

163
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,189
owner operator so I have the freedom to

164
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,560
make decisions but I also utilize the

165
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:30,819
people I have around me I always try to

166
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,129
get as much people in the room as

167
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:34,209
possible before I make any decision

168
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,339
especially if I make it season they grow

169
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:38,109
I always put my growers in wanna make a

170
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:40,149
decision and the trim team I'm gonna

171
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,370
pull my trimmers in I try to build this

172
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:43,658
really good solid team because at the

173
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,478
end of the day that she's really gonna

174
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:49,329
build your brand for you I have about 30

175
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,758
employees and my firm team and and they

176
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:52,310
do more for my brand than any admin

177
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,790
magazine

178
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,350
than any Instagram posts than any

179
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,970
anything just happening those 30 people

180
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,800
go home happy and say that they work for

181
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,960
a good company that stand behind what

182
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,610
they do it's the best thing you could do

183
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,279
for your brand treating employees

184
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,919
respect make sure that they're heard is

185
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,888
really really truly important that's one

186
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:18,349
thing that we managed to do that we're

187
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:19,970
going to successful at but yeah so so

188
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,470
building a brand being competitive make

189
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,720
sure you have your competitive advantage

190
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,400
for us and the data everybody who was

191
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,260
really this corporate breed motto our

192
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:30,469
model where they're trying to cop out

193
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:32,658
really big really fast and chase trends

194
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,089
chase strains and do all those things

195
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:36,529
for us we took the whole living soil

196
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:38,570
approach I didn't know healed the most

197
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:40,399
didn't make the most but again it was

198
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,320
our niche that again we could stand

199
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,809
behind that we were truly passionate

200
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,920
about and it didn't pay off at first I

201
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:48,500
mean especially with the microbial

202
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,759
testing in Nevada I'm sure you guys are

203
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,289
going through it now here in California

204
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:52,490
the stage 3 I think they call it right

205
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:54,829
that's what the microbial Razak the

206
00:08:52,490 --> 00:09:00,350
heavy metals stage 3 is heavy metals

207
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:06,410
right yeah they say so Mike Mike Mike

208
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:07,670
Rowe toxins on phase 3 okay phase 2 okay

209
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:10,219
so you guys are going through it now

210
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:11,329
it's extremely challenging on and early

211
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,009
on especially with the with the

212
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,080
biological system that's one of the

213
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:16,759
biggest things you can fear in like in

214
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,889
Nevada one of the things that helped us

215
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,929
the most is that we opened up first we

216
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:23,088
were one of the first cultivators in the

217
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:24,588
entire state to actually crop out we

218
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:27,140
actually have a brand no one was even

219
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,940
planning on having brands I'm back in

220
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:30,860
everybody was kind of envisioning the

221
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:34,010
Starbucks model where they're going to

222
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,389
grow a flower of a bean if you will and

223
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:37,159
they're gonna sell to a shop and their

224
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:38,480
shops and a seller and you got to

225
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,649
Starbucks you don't asking hey who grew

226
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,269
this beans know you're drinking

227
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:43,069
Starbucks you know and that was kind of

228
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:44,329
that's what all the corporate model

229
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,490
wanted and that's what everybody was

230
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:49,759
kind of heading towards so we got lucky

231
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:52,070
we opened up first and we were able to

232
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,689
kind of differentiate ourselves from

233
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,519
anybody else from behind us we focus on

234
00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:00,619
strengths and focus on how we grew

235
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,928
now I'm welcome grew in me actually they

236
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:04,339
gave us presents in the market where we

237
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:05,360
lack of where there's a cultivated we

238
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:07,100
don't have a dispenser we don't have a

239
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,629
friend to work so by about building a

240
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,490
brand but having a strong brand you're

241
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:12,350
able to have a demand to have people ask

242
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,639
for your product versus if you just

243
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,990
trying to sell your products when

244
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,459
somebody walks into the dispensary and

245
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,869
ask recurring like productions that's

246
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,628
what most powerful things that I can

247
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:22,670
have somebody do in a market where I

248
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:24,110
don't have a front door again so

249
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:25,639
building your brand is would be one of

250
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,308
the most key things you guys to do and

251
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:29,959
again building you know something or not

252
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:31,999
trend but and I'm something that you

253
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,828
actually stand behind it be important in

254
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:35,899
Nevada they're all trying to chase it

255
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:39,649
strange so you have somebody opening up

256
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:43,249
and they're they're selling a box with a

257
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:45,169
gold sticker and this whose box has the

258
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:46,939
prettiest gold sticker with the best

259
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:49,068
labeling and the best packaging and

260
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:50,778
that's essence that's what you're going

261
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:52,039
for that that's in the data market he

262
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:56,029
has the best

263
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:57,740
and that's consumers educate themselves

264
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:00,199
it's okay hot-hot

265
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:04,669
everybody has their centers now how the

266
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:09,680
ground now nobody using pesticides even

267
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:10,969
even synthetic guys aren't pesticides so

268
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,669
how you differentiate yourself from from

269
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,740
not being presence add something organic

270
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:17,120
now you're not using or now are using a

271
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,029
bottled line are you going water only

272
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,350
are you curing properly basically you

273
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:23,360
have to do everything right if you want

274
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,800
to build a brand for me it's what do I

275
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,879
want to smoke that's what I want to grow

276
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:31,009
that's what I want to share with people

277
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:32,360
so for us it's I groped I try to grow

278
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,490
the best way that I could possibly grow

279
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,919
and sell advice with that Cosby so and I

280
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,389
have the freedom to do so as not only an

281
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:41,659
operator but as an owner it's a really

282
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:43,159
good thing so for like for me one of the

283
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,600
biggest fear is when corporate canvas is

284
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:46,219
coming and I thought I was that leaves

285
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,450
that Billy to smoke good quality

286
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,750
medicine I thought I wasn't be stuck

287
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,670
smoking synthetic mids you know people

288
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,970
blue dream or whatever you'll get the

289
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:57,289
most that year so you know I hate no

290
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,389
blue jean shock hopefully trainers

291
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:02,509
against it there's a good strength you

292
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:05,720
know we all know that but no one getting

293
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:07,220
that is is don't build around things

294
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,629
like that don't draw on things again

295
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,220
that you can see I'm behind for us I

296
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:11,870
wanted to set trends not follow trends

297
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,519
so again four years ago we open up this

298
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,799
living soil permaculture driven system

299
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,449
we were forced to go indoors because in

300
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:19,549
Nevada market really wasn't sure what

301
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,800
they were going to do with these new

302
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:23,389
outdoor was a no-go greenhouses were

303
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:24,259
currently getting frowned upon they

304
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:26,509
weren't sure what they were going to do

305
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:27,830
with it so we really focus I really

306
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:30,559
focused on how can I make the most a

307
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,629
single indoor grill and that's again

308
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,979
that's what we added to our brands so it

309
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:36,350
really fit in with everything the LED

310
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,200
lights of the living soil everything we

311
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:41,330
do kind of a screams regenerative in the

312
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,110
most under genitive way we're in a

313
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:46,940
market that's is just completely toxic

314
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:50,210
in the middle of the desert where plants

315
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:53,100
don't flourish and we're cropping us on

316
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,870
the best earth possible in our Piper

317
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,850
per pound whatever however you want

318
00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:00,539
talking to chuck it up is extremely low

319
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:02,940
we're extremely successful and we have

320
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:06,240
presence in an industry where we're not

321
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,890
supposed to because in Nevada one of the

322
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,180
hardest licenses to get and I'm sure you

323
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:12,779
guys again this in California too is a

324
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:15,179
dispensary license is an actual to be

325
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,799
able to sell a product to the public so

326
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:18,719
again if you don't have that and you

327
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,449
don't have a brand you really don't have

328
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,149
anything you're going to end up being a

329
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,580
THC farmer that basically sells to

330
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:28,679
extraction artists or white labels and

331
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,509
you're never gonna be successful and

332
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,189
you're never gonna be able to grow the

333
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:34,980
quality that you want to grow because

334
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:38,400
gonna be chasing that bottom dollar and

335
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,159
racing to the bottom and that's the

336
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,329
beauty there's no children excellent

337
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,949
that we run is that you were able to

338
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,750
compete for that bottom dollar I be able

339
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,670
to race to the bottom and still produce

340
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,110
the highest grade quality product in the

341
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:51,569
market like when you're running a

342
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,409
no-till the organic soil system inputs

343
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,150
are low

344
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:58,199
everything's regenerative plant feeds of

345
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:59,610
soil it just makes sense so I highly

346
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,110
recommend anybody here if you guys are

347
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,990
doing I mean obviously we're here in the

348
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,789
organic capital of cannabis in the world

349
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,830
I guess I'm guessing preaching to the

350
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:09,750
choir as far as that goes but just know

351
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,580
that your your your competitive organic

352
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,649
or your competitive advantage is the

353
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,900
fact that you guys have that organic

354
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,480
back on that do your ability to use the

355
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,909
Sun the ability to you have to bring all

356
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,430
these pretty materials around your

357
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:26,509
resources around you that's huge

358
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,509
build your brand around that

359
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:34,359
you
