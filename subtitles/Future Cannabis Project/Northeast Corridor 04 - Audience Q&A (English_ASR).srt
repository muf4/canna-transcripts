[Music]

2
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:16,559
let's open it up to Q&amp;A I mean what do

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,380
you guys I mean we've kind of covered in

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,629
most of the major issues within the

5
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:27,598
industry what questions do you have for

6
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:43,649
our panel any one question yes in the

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:46,649
back okay so the question has to do with

8
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,710
entry level if you're a smaller player

9
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,750
if if it's becoming really difficult for

10
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,489
a small business person to enter into

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,140
the industry what's the area that they

12
00:00:53,488 --> 00:01:00,718
could enter into laboratory testing it's

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,759
state mandated every products got to go

14
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,460
through a laboratory to be tested for

15
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,228
for purity and and that it has the

16
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,139
appropriate levels and it's free from

17
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:11,819
pesticides it's it's state mandated no

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,439
matter how many businesses are out there

19
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:14,969
they all got to go through the labs so

20
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,709
you still have to the laboratory

21
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:20,269
equipment in hiring the scientist is

22
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:23,009
expensive I mean it seems like

23
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:28,379
extraction is is really because you

24
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:30,299
could buy an extra no no the the states

25
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,250
the states like to keep that firewall

26
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,350
where they have the labs totally

27
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,239
independent from and in some states

28
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,679
producers in some states it's the state

29
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,728
that does the testing there are no

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,860
independent labs like I think it's at

31
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:42,569
Pennsylvania that I think it's a

32
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,390
Pennsylvania maybe DC but there's some

33
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,529
places where the states actually well I

34
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,530
just learned this week that in Arizona

35
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,700
there is no license for testing yeah one

36
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,840
of our customers says we'd like to be in

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,219
your database like great you have a

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,700
license no we don't need one in this

39
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,349
state like okay we'll put you in but so

40
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,359
it differs by state in Connecticut you

41
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:01,618
need a controlled substances license so

42
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,578
if you go look at all those licenses in

43
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:04,290
Connecticut they're all the police

44
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:05,669
stations and the universities and then

45
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,590
you can find a couple that seemed to be

46
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,118
more corporate or just their own

47
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,769
business so but

48
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:15,900
just in transport you can test your well

49
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:17,879
that's you know I mean today I feel like

50
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,950
extraction you could buy an extraction

51
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:24,780
machine for what about sixty thousand a

52
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:27,419
hundred thousand right right right

53
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,310
and then then there's obviously well

54
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:31,318
distribution well that starts to become

55
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,479
but but but did the question about the

56
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,179
Jersey in New York I think the hard part

57
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,189
is those are still oligopoly is there's

58
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,840
only a handful licenses out there and in

59
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:41,729
New York the licenses are stacked so if

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,379
I give you a license in New York you

61
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:45,810
have to grow you have to manufacture and

62
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,269
you have to run five stores four stores

63
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,920
so you have to do it all so there is no

64
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,560
easy way for somebody to say hey I want

65
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,789
to do that too I mean and I think in New

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,189
Jersey it's the same way it's a stack

67
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,109
license so it's vertically integrated by

68
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:00,180
design every states different though

69
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,560
like in Connecticut they've stacked it

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,390
where you have to if you get a grow

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,789
license you have to manufacture and

72
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:07,199
there's four of those licenses but now

73
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:10,590
they're moving up to eighteen

74
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,089
dispensaries and it's just now we have

75
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,799
one license it actually managed to

76
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,280
vertically integrate but they did that

77
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,250
on their own

78
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,068
so the Cuomo proposal for New York very

79
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,169
much models the California distribution

80
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:24,208
change where there's gonna be cultivator

81
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,488
licenses manufacturer license

82
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,699
distributor license retail and

83
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:32,430
laboratory testing manufacturer are the

84
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,098
guys who take the raw cannabis material

85
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:43,980
they extract it out and make a product

86
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:48,179
or oil or whatever that you have to keep

87
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:49,858
the to grow and the retail separate like

88
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,599
right now it's vertically integrated

89
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:56,909
right but I was reading that that Cuomo

90
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:58,768
doesn't want that he wants the grocery I

91
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:00,659
know it's either New York or New Jersey

92
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,549
I can't remember which but one of them

93
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,590
in their proposal does have that quark

94
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,739
where if you're a retailer you can't

95
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,810
have your own cultivation license which

96
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,280
is I don't know what the rationale

97
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,169
behind it we're Colorado they have a

98
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,449
specific license it does just that which

99
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,739
is like a captive license so it's every

100
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:18,358
state is different and comes up with

101
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,668
their own peculiarities I was gonna say

102
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,740
at least for the California experience

103
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,318
and the retail market is

104
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,538
extremely competitive and one of the

105
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,669
ways that like brands have set

106
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:31,860
themselves apart is to be like a really

107
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:34,318
great cultivator have a retail location

108
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,030
in your name where you can only get

109
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,740
certain products like it's a sneaker

110
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:39,209
drop and there's a line you know two

111
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,650
blocks out there to get the latest

112
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:42,180
harvest if they actually a cottage

113
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:44,098
license they call it a cottage license I

114
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,050
think in California for those kind of

115
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:52,228
scenarios where people are you know

116
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:55,050
really craft growers and sellers I'm

117
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:57,060
just so like wherever we are now in a

118
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,579
couple of years I mean there's certainly

119
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,189
you know a lot of people only want to be

120
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:04,889
self-employed and don't want to work for

121
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:08,939
someone and I certainly respect that I'm

122
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:12,030
self-employed but there's tons of jobs

123
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:17,219
you could check out Thanks

124
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:21,168
va and GST indeed actually post cannabis

125
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:24,539
jobs now if you look at some of the MSOs

126
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:28,019
most of them have career sections on

127
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:31,139
their websites whether it's acreage or i

128
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:33,598
anthis cure leaf you know some of that

129
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,120
the new york's even locally i think that

130
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:37,529
one of our clients KD s staffing there

131
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,180
in new jersey and they're recruiting for

132
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:41,879
him and they've built out a cannabis

133
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,978
practice there nearby so question over

134
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,978
here mary's list

135
00:05:52,449 --> 00:06:08,990
sign up as an employer so Mary's las'

136
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:11,930
independent contractors flower hire okay

137
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,228
flower hire thank you thank you another

138
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,228
question

139
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:22,610
know anything about Monsanto's role in

140
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:27,438
the cannabis industry as it relates to

141
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:30,770
cultivator and what type of protections

142
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,180
actually have you heard any government

143
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:34,519
officials talking about rolling out

144
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,490
protections for cultivators farmers and

145
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:41,028
growers who do create a certain strain

146
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:43,908
and being able to own I keep very good

147
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:46,848
question about first starting about

148
00:06:43,908 --> 00:07:04,218
Monsanto but then really going into like

149
00:06:46,848 --> 00:07:07,189
patenting strains I was out in Humboldt

150
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:08,658
County and I know California you may

151
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:12,098
know better than me but they were

152
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:16,218
talking about kind of creating in

153
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:18,110
Humboldt County this this standard which

154
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:21,009
would be similar to what you see in the

155
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:24,259
wine industry that you can only claim

156
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:27,919
you know champagne is from the champagne

157
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:31,250
area and it gets thank you appellation

158
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:33,288
and that you know you can only call

159
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,968
yourself Humboldt finest if you're from

160
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:45,199
Humboldt County and then it gets into

161
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:46,759
the tour yeah so that is what I've heard

162
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,050
I know that there's been a lot of

163
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,610
discussion about trying to patent

164
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:56,870
cannabinoids and such GW Pharmaceuticals

165
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:59,300
just got rejected on that they tried to

166
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,949
do that I know different people have

167
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,100
come out

168
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:05,620
had to patent different strains and I

169
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,810
don't know if they've been so successful

170
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,280
I think it's hard to patent a plan

171
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:13,420
that's the problem

172
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:17,219
I think and and we've also seen a lot of

173
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:21,879
while you can call something Sour Diesel

174
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:24,130
that when they've tested it cloning and

175
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,050
all that that they've determined that

176
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:29,259
half the time when you think you're

177
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,579
buying you know cherry diesel sour it

178
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,168
isn't even really that's something like

179
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:34,299
with lab tests it really has to go a

180
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:36,189
step further besides pesticides and

181
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:37,899
contaminants and all this I mean you

182
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,860
they really have to figure out how to

183
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:44,168
really test for these strains that

184
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,480
genetic testing the whole package yeah

185
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:48,579
really long way to go there's that this

186
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,340
industry has a lot of growth there's a

187
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:54,090
company out in Long Island a does DNA

188
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:57,460
mapping and they did it with cotton and

189
00:08:54,090 --> 00:09:00,070
that's how they determine what pima

190
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,050
cotton is versus not pima cotton and

191
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,420
Egyptian cotton and all these cotton

192
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:06,279
varieties and that's what they've done

193
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,229
is they DNA mapped it and that they're

194
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,839
they're trying now to get into cannabis

195
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:15,840
so that they can map the the cannabis

196
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:19,649
plants and and we resolved that well

197
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,649
know everything Deborah

198
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:35,909
somebody else accidentally Stacy gelato

199
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:37,350
and calling it something else and it

200
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,240
wines that they the same thing like to

201
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,330
be heard did your Grover have concerned

202
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,129
about and he kind of like this person

203
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,300
clearly doesn't understand genetics or

204
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:47,299
the plants because

205
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,210
that is fascinating you're saying

206
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:53,009
stealing

207
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:56,850
company does have technology

208
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,850
because that patience

209
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,009
that there Derek said there's the hope

210
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,639
and Canada's project there's pylos

211
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:08,419
there's with this one genomics at a loss

212
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,419
there's a lot of yeah

213
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:14,019
right love that

214
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,570
well and I think that that's you know

215
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,090
there are some strains that are very

216
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,590
popular but you have to wonder is it

217
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:29,620
just marketing is it really the strain

218
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:31,720
you know I think that the one thing that

219
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:35,190
I really haven't seen a lot of work on

220
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,300
was the THC V which is the cannabis that

221
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,130
doesn't give you the munchies and

222
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:41,109
apparently it was extremely hard to

223
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:43,929
extract it's very expensive you don't

224
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:46,259
see it very often that's the only one

225
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:49,059
that I've heard about that hasn't really

226
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:51,279
had a lot of success you know I was at a

227
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:54,789
conference I think in Toronto and they

228
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:58,299
had a person who really was starting to

229
00:10:54,789 --> 00:11:00,699
talk about all the tests and trials that

230
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:04,089
were running in Israel and he shared the

231
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,340
number of terpenes and other elements

232
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,290
that are in these plants and he said

233
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,430
they're like decades of research left to

234
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:11,649
do because there are so many

235
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:13,449
interactions to try and figure out based

236
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:15,159
on what's in each of these sort of

237
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,100
fingerprinted plants as she said I mean

238
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:19,659
there's so much work to do that there's

239
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,009
gonna be a lot of research and you know

240
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:22,929
hopefully a lot of great discovery but

241
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:24,519
it's it's incredibly complex so when

242
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:26,649
people just sort of boil it down to oh

243
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,059
its THC or CBD they're missing out on

244
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:29,919
the other you know hundred and ten

245
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:31,329
things that you need to yeah the whole

246
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,669
spectrum that you really need to look at

247
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:36,460
so the question has to do with vaping

248
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:38,919
what we're hearing I know that it's

249
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:42,100
clearly becoming a product of choice

250
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:46,240
that the consumers are gravitating more

251
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:50,500
towards vape products that gives you a

252
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:55,419
mood description sleep relax action

253
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:59,259
inspire whatever versus a vape that is

254
00:11:55,419 --> 00:12:01,569
Sour Diesel like apparently that's where

255
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:03,879
the shopping is going that's according

256
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,650
to ease data that will be coming out

257
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:07,720
this week and a report that I have

258
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:11,500
written that will publish on Wednesday

259
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:14,920
but I thought that was super interesting

260
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:18,610
that the sales are gravitating to that

261
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:21,639
mood related vape product versus the

262
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:24,269
strain related bait product and vape

263
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,189
products are definitely on the rise and

264
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:29,399
overtaking the say

265
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,260
of flour in a Deborah's conference a

266
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,139
couple months ago one of the speakers

267
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:35,519
that you had their tracks does a lot of

268
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:38,490
market research like consumer type

269
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,819
market research and her point was that

270
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:44,190
there has been such an increase in the

271
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,780
number of vape companies and and the

272
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,460
point was sort of like how many can the

273
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:48,839
market support so the specialization

274
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,700
that you describe makes a lot of sense

275
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,070
because now the market is starting to

276
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,600
specialize and certain ones will win out

277
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,210
but I think her point was you know we

278
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,920
have 485 vape companies do you really

279
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,560
want to be number 486 and how will you

280
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:04,679
differentiate yourself so you marketing

281
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:07,409
yeah but still only if you will win I

282
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:10,620
think the interesting thing that we're

283
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:14,250
seeing with vape companies or in just

284
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,750
manufacturers in general is that in an

285
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,370
open I'm gonna call it as opposed to

286
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,289
like a closed state like New York where

287
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,960
it's a very small number of licensees in

288
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:24,240
an open state like California where

289
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,250
there's you know hundreds or thousands

290
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,090
of manufacturing license issued and

291
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:34,409
they're making oil is that folks aren't

292
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:37,110
ready for the level of manufacturing

293
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:38,879
hygiene practices that that the state

294
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,250
requires in order to maintain your

295
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,220
licenses because you're we're

296
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,320
transitioning from an industry where it

297
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,080
was just a bunch of guys in a warehouse

298
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,660
with a machine processing cannabis flour

299
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,509
to now the states looking at all right

300
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:57,360
well is your facility facility design

301
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:59,309
logical what quality control measures

302
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,110
are you implementing in place to make

303
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:04,169
sure that there's no cross contamination

304
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,240
or allergens in your product and and for

305
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:08,519
a lot of these folks it's a huge wake-up

306
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,080
call because they're they're used to you

307
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,939
know running retail shops and now

308
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,040
they're manufacturing they're putting

309
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,500
hundreds of thousands of vape cartridges

310
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:18,719
into the marketplace and with that comes

311
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,909
products liability what happens when

312
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,370
something goes wrong what do you do when

313
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:24,779
you have to implement a recall and just

314
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,419
you know we talked about this you know

315
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:29,429
constant tension between the multi-state

316
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:32,370
operators the big business the deep

317
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:34,319
pockets and then the regulatory for the

318
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,629
regular people who are working within

319
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,950
this industry and that's like a real

320
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:42,029
point of regulatory failure that's

321
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:45,070
to happen is that a lot of these

322
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:46,779
mom-and-pop manufacturers they just

323
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:49,330
aren't going to be able to keep up with

324
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:51,970
the quality control standards necessary

325
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:54,550
to produce you know clean products and

326
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,560
put it into the marketplace I would say

327
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:59,740
though that you know it doesn't take

328
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:04,209
that much it doesn't take that big of an

329
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:07,060
office or factory I don't you know to

330
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:10,720
produce this because your extraction

331
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:12,549
machine is really not that big and you

332
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,660
know it's maybe the size of that bar

333
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:18,549
area you your biggest inventory areas

334
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:20,500
where you've got all your raw product

335
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:23,349
that's because it's so chunky and and

336
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,169
all these like bins and such your

337
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,730
scientists your lab people you know it's

338
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:30,009
really I've been to many of these

339
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,649
operations they're not that big but

340
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:35,319
they're churning out tons and tons of

341
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:37,809
babe and a lot of the big vape companies

342
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:40,750
private label for a lot of people so

343
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:43,539
like open vape private labels from

344
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:47,230
numerous companies they'll just come in

345
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:48,939
and say hey I want you know green marker

346
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,110
report vape pen and they're like yeah

347
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,580
sure you know we're going to charge you

348
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,590
an arm and a leg to do it but yeah we'll

349
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,270
do it and they make your vape pen for

350
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,430
you and they slap your label on it and

351
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:58,960
they distribute it for you and you're

352
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:01,389
good to go but of course you're probably

353
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,100
given up 50% of your your revenue for

354
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:05,710
them to do that but you're immediately

355
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:09,490
in the market and very easy it's really

356
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:12,040
super quick but you're paying through

357
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,450
the nose for that but I'll tell you

358
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:15,069
right now they're a private company

359
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,400
they're doing over 100 million in sales

360
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:20,410
a year

361
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:23,629
[Music]

362
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:27,588
I'm John I'm just saying that it's it's

363
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:30,889
big business I mean there's there about

364
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:32,690
the only one I know that has really said

365
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,519
how much money they're making off of a

366
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,970
pence now they were early to the market

367
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:40,220
they were early on in Colorado they do a

368
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,680
nice operation it's a really well-run

369
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,528
company they take very good care of

370
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:46,698
their employees and they've had no

371
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:48,230
desire to go public

372
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:54,769
I think they'll eventually go public

373
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:58,879
just because yell yeah why not I mean

374
00:16:54,769 --> 00:17:01,549
I've worked hard I you know worked long

375
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,308
long hours week after week month after

376
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:06,588
month year after year yeah I'm tired I'm

377
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:09,349
ready to get out and I think that may be

378
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:11,208
why they go public but listen they've

379
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:16,159
only had to raise money once and they

380
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:18,860
did it with one investor open babe no

381
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,209
they bootstrapped it's an incredible

382
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:21,798
story they bootstrapped

383
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,798
and now they're doing over 100 million

384
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:28,639
in sales a year and they're really smart

385
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:32,319
about loyalty programs they're really

386
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,640
smart about working with the bud tenders

387
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,470
they have loyalty programs with the cup

388
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,490
customers they have loyalty programs

389
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,679
with the bud tenders

390
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,240
so that would they were one of the first

391
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,840
companies that figure that out

392
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:48,289
and now almost all the dispensaries have

393
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,990
loyalty programs but I don't know that

394
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:52,700
that many of the product companies do

395
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,710
that I've talked to a bunch of them and

396
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,900
I usually ask him if they do that you

397
00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:01,370
know does Popham Barkley do that does

398
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:04,009
can't doesn't do that and most of them

399
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:06,439
say no and it's just crazy it's like why

400
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:08,329
wouldn't you do that the other thing

401
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,419
we're seeing with vape sand and if

402
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:13,339
here's like your side business if you

403
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:15,679
don't have the capital to get a license

404
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:18,168
is just counterfeiting like they're

405
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,210
they're they're you can go on Alibaba

406
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:22,309
now and buy the packaging for any big

407
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,690
vape brand in the United States and and

408
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:25,399
they're you know being sold wherever

409
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,890
it's it's low quality product that

410
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,450
they're putting into it but but folks

411
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,140
don't care some of these brands have

412
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,539
built up such a brand recognized

413
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,759
and status symbol associated with them

414
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:37,500
folks just want to you know get it as

415
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,900
cheaply as possible to have the look

416
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,150
we've gone from counterfeit Yeezys and

417
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,420
counterfeit Gucci to counterfeit vapes

418
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:47,970
now so there's a market and and product

419
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,950
security like whatever that technology

420
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,049
is going to be so that folks know that

421
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,779
they have like the real vape cartridge

422
00:18:52,049 --> 00:19:03,149
because folks in California are losing a

423
00:18:54,779 --> 00:19:05,129
lot of money to copycats they're not

424
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,230
being sold in the retailers they're

425
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,510
being sold on the streets and unlicensed

426
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,430
stores they're being shipped to places

427
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:18,720
where cannabis isn't allowed as if it

428
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:20,910
were the real thing right so the point

429
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,230
I'm making is is that they're people

430
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,029
just want to have the look of the

431
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,890
product and it's being counterfeited out

432
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,809
there so people are willing to buy the

433
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,759
bootleg knockoff version of these

434
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:31,950
manufactured products because they don't

435
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,230
want to pay the cannabis tax and all the

436
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:37,049
costs associated with the real thing why

437
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,779
buy the $70 dosis pen when I can buy the

438
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:41,579
bootleg dosis pen for 25 bucks who knows

439
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,769
what's in it it's never been lab tested

440
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,899
but it's white and it vibrates and it

441
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:48,119
looks like doses it's like that weed van

442
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,490
that you see around the Union Square I

443
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:54,329
mean that thing is so illegal and it's

444
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:56,009
so bright when I've walked up to that

445
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,899
van before and just asked a few

446
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:59,460
questions the minute I started asking a

447
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,900
couple of questions they were like no we

448
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,940
don't sell that at all like when I first

449
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,800
walked up yeah we got that and then all

450
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,730
of a sudden I'm like but you can't do

451
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,730
that because that's illegal right we

452
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,319
don't sell that like and they're

453
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:16,920
complete their blatant they're just

454
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:22,349
driving around thinking humor man no no

455
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:25,080
ice cream truck but mr. Safi one thing

456
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:27,029
they like about these vape products from

457
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,849
my experience like a few of them are

458
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:32,579
made in China and they're all made in

459
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:36,059
China the hardware really really poor

460
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:38,039
quality and they're it's almost like

461
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:40,889
you're sucking in chemicals of some sort

462
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:43,799
like they're not healthy there's clear

463
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,530
there clearly is a health risk with some

464
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,180
of these products

465
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:48,670
and the ones that don't have that

466
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:53,920
problem they leak I've had some just

467
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:56,500
busted in my pocket in which markets

468
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,019
well there I've gotten I've had this

469
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,150
experience pretty much across the board

470
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:04,869
but some units if you go to em jape is

471
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:09,180
that the big conference in Vegas got

472
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:12,879
that there were there's so many Chinese

473
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:15,430
and they their signs are all in Chinese

474
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:26,920
like there's heart they hardly speak any

475
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:29,590
English some do well that's the actual

476
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,600
cartridge it has to be tested the actual

477
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:34,750
product I'm talking about like if you

478
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:36,250
think of it as the battery and the the

479
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:56,500
component that you actually put the

480
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:59,009
ceramic heating that's good so we have a

481
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,009
question over here

482
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,519
and the concerns that that causes for

483
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,150
lung cancer or bubble bones and that's

484
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:26,009
not hit the industry as a publicist that

485
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,019
kind of like blows my mind that views

486
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:30,089
reporters just like when after my

487
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:32,009
clients and the whole thing we have to

488
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:33,959
you know help out and it's not hit

489
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:36,119
cannabis or mates yet and so I think

490
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,549
that anybody who is going to have a

491
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:40,109
vaporizer it does need to be prepared

492
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:44,609
for that because it will eventually

493
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:46,289
happen and there is the heating coils

494
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:51,299
depending on the quality of the

495
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:53,759
manufacturer some of them are you know

496
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:56,519
like for example Joule those heating

497
00:22:53,759 --> 00:23:01,019
coils are much stronger and harsher on

498
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:04,379
the lungs than right and I think that

499
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:07,379
her point you know is that we still have

500
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,510
a long way to go to know what is going

501
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,730
to be the effect of all these vape pens

502
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:14,129
and you've got a variety of products

503
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:17,429
because you do have like a dry material

504
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:19,890
type of vape pen where you put the dry

505
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:21,540
material in and it heats it up and then

506
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,660
you had that combustion and and you're

507
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:30,240
basically smoking a dry product whether

508
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:34,410
it's tobacco or cannabis but then like

509
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,808
pax pax has the dry herb product and

510
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:39,540
then you've got the actual vape pens

511
00:23:36,808 --> 00:23:42,750
with the oil which is a very different

512
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:44,609
product but very convenient but yeah I

513
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:50,089
don't think we've really seen very many

514
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:50,089
studies on the effects of these items

515
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:56,028
anybody else all right well I think

516
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:59,690
we've gone over a lot

517
00:23:56,028 --> 00:24:01,700
