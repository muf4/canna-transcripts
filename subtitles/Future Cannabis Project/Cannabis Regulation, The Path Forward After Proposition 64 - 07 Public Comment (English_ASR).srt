assembly member uh Thomas Ridley

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,160
Thomas's comments um I do believe that

21
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:02,119
there is a deep concern um I believe

22
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,640
earlier Mr join Sawyer also pointed to

23
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,920
the lack of Outreach um to the actual

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,840
community so I hear a lot of local

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,920
governments talking but the community is

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,000
not I represent over 22 African-American

27

meetings to be able to talk about this

31
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,599
it's affected our community in a way

32
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,438
that I mean many of you know how the

33
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,078
drug the War on Drugs have affected our

34
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,919
community and I just believe that um I'm

35
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:30,639
hoping that I can work with the

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,719

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,200
working with everybody associated with

53
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,679
the regulatory process has been very

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,080
positive and I look forward to

55
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,519
continuing to work with them as we go

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,239
forward thank you Miss cavier again I'd

57
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:20,039
like to thank the chair as well and to

58
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,920
say that you know um it is interesting

59
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:27,199
to me to see um how smoothly this is

60
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:30,318
moving forward um I thought the 18

61
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:33,000
January 1st 18 day was crazy and people

62
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:36,199
have worked really hard at trying to uh

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,199
make it work um it the best way to do

64
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:42,039
regulations is not do the emergency

65
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:45,399
regulation process and so um that we

66
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:48,199
have that we had people here that um

67
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,840
that represent really important interest

68
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,359
in this industry saying that it's been a

69
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,598
good process so far I think is really

70
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,000
outstanding so there's a lot more work

71
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:59,439
to be done and they haven't seen the

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,199
regulations yet so um that's maybe pre

73
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,878
premature but I want to also recognize

74
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:10,000
and um and acknowledge the hard work

75
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:14,598
that's gone on by the um by not only um

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,799
the department um uh of Public Health um

77
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:20,399
the um food nag and also the bureau um

78
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,239
but everybody that's working on this

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,158
it's it's a miracle that it we've got

80
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,360
this far and that um people are nodding

81
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,079
their heads and it's going in the right

82
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,799
direction so thank you to

83
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,159

96
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,120

97

anybody I apologize but I think uh that

105
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,120
was a good it was a good showing so

106
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,959
there's a lot of interest here in the

107
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,918
legislature about not only how this is

108
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,799
unfolding and the framework we put

109
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:35,719
around it but the public safety aspects

110
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,319
as well whether it's around um Edibles

111
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,720
or the amount of dispensaries or where

112
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,879
they're located um also Transportation

113
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,800
you know there is definitely a a concern

114
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,439
here and something that we want to make

115
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,120
sure that one it's not in the hands of

116
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,719
children but also that we're making sure

117
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,038
that our communities are safe and that

118
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,039
this is done responsibly and we'll

119
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:57,478
continue to not only work on this in our

120
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:59,038
policy hearings but probably even um

121
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:00,599
have another informational hearing just

122
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:02,800
to see how things are going along the

123
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,400
way so with that I will conclude The

124
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,680
Joint informational hearing between the

125
