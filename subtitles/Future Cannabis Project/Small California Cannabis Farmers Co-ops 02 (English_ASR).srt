1
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,359
yet first of all I do I do see coops

2
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:25,299
working together and there's more to it

3
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,560
than just crop coordination there's more

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,750
to it than just trying to mandate

5
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,070
everybody to grow the same things even

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,159
in the formation of our local

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,378
cooperative we've been able to learn

8
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,929
from successes and failures alike from

9
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:40,750
the different incarnations of Emerald

10
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:42,850
grown over the years and being able to

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,320
reach out to farmers that are going

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,439
through parallel permitting process

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,420
processes in other counties learn from

14
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:55,420
an extra year or two of experience has

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:56,710
been very very helpful um and so you

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,448
know I'll just speak to emerald grown

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,820
specifically emerald grown is not a

18
00:00:58,448 --> 00:01:03,429
cannabis cooperative it is a federation

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,890
of cannabis cooperatives and so there's

20
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:07,780
a certain level of efficiency and scale

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,840
you can achieve within a single chapter

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,969
22 co-op that is limited at four acres

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,978
cumulative so the membership of the coop

24
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:18,340
as a whole can only grow a total of four

25
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:20,618
acres but if you link together ten four

26
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,079
acre blocks then you're a much larger

27
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:25,149
scale and so the Federation structure is

28
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:27,280
relatively common in agriculture it is

29
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:29,920
relatively common to two agricultural

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,689
producers there there's a rice growers

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,399
coalition in the northern half of

32
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:36,879
California's Central Valley that is a

33
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,739
bit like a Federation of co-ops that's

34
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,079
that nobody's ever quite made a model

35
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:43,270
like the Emerald grown model it is

36
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,909
intentionally meant to be a place where

37
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,618
all of the coops can come together at

38
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,238
the end of the day cooperation to me is

39
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:51,280
about much more than how we structure

40
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:54,700
our businesses cooperation is the reason

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,769
why humans Homo sapiens persisted when

42
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,349
other upper level primates didn't this

43
00:01:56,769 --> 00:02:00,939
is actually to our very core it is my

44
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:03,728
belief that our ability to work together

45
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:06,039
makes us who we are ability to empathize

46
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:08,439
to care about other people's interests

47
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,989
needs their feelings and so cooperation

48
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,060
runs much much deeper and so this isn't

49
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:15,489
just about forming a co-op this is about

50
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,439
creating a cooperative global system and

51
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:21,159
what better resource to do it within

52
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,780
cannabis and you know we have been able

53
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,250
to flex some of those efficiencies of

54
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,959
scale to talk with some of the leading

55
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,209
experts there's a law firm out of

56
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,289
Arkansas where agriculture coops are

57
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:30,580
very common

58
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:32,500
these folks would literally wrote the

59
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,439
book called special laws pertaining to

60
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,030
agricultural cooperatives 0% chance that

61
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:39,219
any one of our farms would have been

62
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,810
able to afford them collectively we've

63
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,609
been able to spend some time working

64
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,729
with them and so we've hammered out I

65
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:49,000
think a pretty cannibis it was

66
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:50,889
definitely born of cannabis and it's

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,568
meant for our market one last point on

68
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:54,279
being able to work together you know

69
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:56,048
sometimes we take flak that the Emerald

70
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,878
triangle is the Emerald triangle and it

71
00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:00,459
doesn't include you guys and and I just

72
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:02,078
want to make very clear that that to me

73
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:03,759
there's something deeper than the place

74
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:05,920
where I grew up there's a culture that I

75
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,658
grew up in like Casey said when he

76
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,789
crossed the river like this was home

77
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:11,798
this is where our people live and I felt

78
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,568
that since I decided to be an advocate

79
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,250
and get to know growers all over the

80
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,798
state you feel that in these different

81
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,539
pockets so the Emerald triangle may be a

82
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:21,579
three County geography on the north

83
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:23,378
coast but the culture the the Emerald

84
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:25,480
grown culture is something larger that

85
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:27,459
transcends and it's something that as we

86
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:29,738
go global I think it is something

87
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,870
recognizable that a much larger group of

88
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:34,090
coops can stand behind at the end of the

89
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,370
day I think we should be the supplier

90
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,079
the primary supplier of flour globally

91
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,000
and I think we should do that by working

92
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:42,219
together I think that's the pathway

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,810
forward at this point and you know kind

94
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:48,310
of piggybacking on that there's a

95
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,150
difficult that there's a loss in

96
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,500
translation a lot of the times in in the

97
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,030
you know you talk you really hit the

98
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,769
nail on the head Jonathan with the two

99
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,439
circles the industry circle and the

100
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:01,599
culture circle and when those overlap

101
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,340
magic happens and a lot of times that

102
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,798
overlap isn't happening and one of the

103
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,848
big questions for us has been how do you

104
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:12,730
in trying to convey the culture like how

105
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:14,679
do you accomplish that and with the the

106
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:16,238
the co-operative statute only allowing

107
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,358
four farms 10,000 square feet and

108
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,429
smaller that creates a definition that's

109
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,779
a that creates the potential for a

110
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,069
paradigm there and so that's one of the

111
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:27,279
things that I'm really excited about is

112
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:29,620
this idea that cooperative cannabis can

113
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,019
come to mean and to be synonymous with

114
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,829
the culture that we all come from

115
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:38,288
because it was cooperative like if you

116
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:40,658
know if the one neighborhood got cleaned

117
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:42,629
out that by the Fed then everybody

118
00:04:40,658 --> 00:04:44,550
chipped in for the winter you know

119
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:48,870
so it's it's been this thing over

120
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:50,850
decades for a long time and it's both

121
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,470
like I think the most challenging and

122
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,150
heartbreaking thing right now in terms

123
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,670
of seeing the transition but also the

124
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:58,769
the biggest point of potential moving

125
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,870
forward is that this thing has been real

126
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:02,909
and and has meant something and if we

127
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:07,050
can communicate that to the marketplace

128
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:09,300
in a way that that is understandable

129
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,889
then it's it's gonna stand on its own

130
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,780
for the future and especially you know

131
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:15,000
that the state market it right now is

132
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,129
really really challenging but when you

133
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,350
look at you know this this whole thing

134
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:21,180
happening with like acreage and the

135
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,160
thing being hinged on federal

136
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,569
legalization when like that kind of

137
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,890
money starts to move in that arena

138
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,870
you're like well this is gonna happen

139
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,310
really soon and so when we start to look

140
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,829
at what happens under federal

141
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,780
legalization cooperative California

142
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:35,819
cannabis I think has a tremendous

143
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:37,199
potential and it's like you know fed

144
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:39,120
legalization has been kind of like the

145
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,979
pie in the sky thing for a long time but

146
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,490
like I say when you start to see that

147
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,710
kind of monetary happening it's like oh

148
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,540
boy this this thing is shifting fast and

149
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:50,759
so for us it's about like I you know I I

150
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,530
feel that it's it's about getting

151
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,889
ourselves together and being able to

152
00:05:52,529 --> 00:06:02,399
agree on a paradigm that represents what

153
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:04,430
has been and what will be in commercial

154
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,689
horticulture we've typically seen coops

155
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,639
gathering together to just bring a

156
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:11,879
similar crop to market with more

157
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,089
efficiencies what do you guys see as the

158
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,370
the possibility of working with the

159
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:19,289
special genetics that each of our small

160
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,110
farms have that we've all been breeding

161
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,120
on our own pieces of property I mean you

162
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,639
know all the large scale farmers are

163
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,949
growing acres of diesel and all the

164
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,649
desert flavors and all the batik flavors

165
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:34,409
and and even as a small farmer yeah okay

166
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:36,839
we can we can most likely produce a

167
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,840
higher quality product of that strain

168
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:41,639
but but what value do we have of having

169
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,799
the genetics that aren't available to

170
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,479
these large scale farmers this is both

171
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,340
like the tremendous blessing and

172
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,790
something of a curse like the first year

173
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:54,989
with emerald groves like we had 40 farms

174
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:56,550
everybody had 10 to 25 strains 2 to 10

175
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,920
pounds 20 pile

176
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,460
son it was just like oh my god happy so

177
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,439
it's like like start start small like

178
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:06,149
start with something that works and

179
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,939
branch back out into it one of the

180
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:10,979
things that I'm really hopeful for is is

181
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,259
cooperative nursery processes cuz it's

182
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,210
like everybody knows old-timers that

183
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,199
have a barrel full of seeds of all kind

184
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:17,519
of things that we didn't know what they

185
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,050
are we don't know what they test we

186
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,109
don't know what they do there's there's

187
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,939
been no systematic genetic sift and and

188
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,060
a lot of those seeds are in danger of

189
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:29,339
going by and so you know I think it's

190
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,709
it's a dual facet of like figure out

191
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:33,869
some baselines that work and then

192
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:34,919
develop into and I'm saying this because

193
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,420
this is what I'm trying to figure out

194
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,770
myself right now is like what are the

195
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,540
things that work and then what can I

196
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:41,310
develop into moving forward because it's

197
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,319
like if you show up with four hundred

198
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,699
strains of two to ten pounds of each

199
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,730
it's just it's like a marketing

200
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:50,310
nightmare and so that there's a there's

201
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:52,560
a I think a balance there of like

202
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:55,399
figuring out what are special unique

203
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,430
things to each terroir to each

204
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:01,379
neighborhoods and then being able to to

205
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,750
propagate those forward within the

206
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:06,480
cooperative and then also sift along to

207
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,519
find other things moving forward so you

208
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,730
know first I think we could look at

209
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,680
coffee as a relatively decent analog in

210
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,780
terms of other commodities that I'm

211
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,699
checking on and keeping an eye on there

212
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,199
we are seeing a proliferation of more

213
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,149
genetic diversity there and we are

214
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,209
seeing co-ops and connection between

215
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:27,359
market and-and-and farm build some of

216
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:29,819
that so to me you actually when we when

217
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,210
we formed Emerald grown the goal was to

218
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:35,580
sort of document to catalog to

219
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,889
articulate the craft and the culture the

220
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,480
culture of craft cannabis and we came up

221
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:41,250
with four elements microclimates

222
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,139
genetics culture and heritage and so

223
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,179
genetics are the point of this whole

224
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:47,159
experiment is to proliferate more

225
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:49,529
diversity the way that we're dealing

226
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,409
with this operationally this year you

227
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,329
know we our marketing strategy is the

228
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:56,370
tool with which we sort of balance

229
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,770
between consumer demand and suppliers

230
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,389
needs and it's not a one-way street it's

231
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:02,309
it's very much a two-way street and so

232
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:05,250
we're trying to create opportunity for

233
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:07,019
both we're encouraging that folks who

234
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,970
participate in the Emerald grown program

235
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,289
grow for the house brand the house brand

236
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,480
is prescriptive it

237
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:15,240
a couple genetics that we've picked out

238
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,430
you know a good upper a good downer good

239
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,870
in the middle and a solid CBD everybody

240
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:20,698
grows a little bit of that so we will

241
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,740
have a consistent house brand around the

242
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:24,778
state if you need it but then we also

243
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,730
are building spin-off brands whether

244
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:29,009
they're regional brands to highlight a

245
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,690
place whether they're cooperative brands

246
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:32,730
whether they're brand collaborations and

247
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,199
these brands get a lot more specialized

248
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,269
the one that will be bringing to market

249
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:38,849
first is farm cut it's a minimally

250
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:40,709
processed process on the farm the farmer

251
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,690
is getting not a great price for the

252
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:44,969
pound but because they're also getting

253
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,860
the labor of packaging there's enough of

254
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,720
a value add on farm that they're getting

255
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,970
a living wage for that pound it's that

256
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,949
and and that farm cut product is meant

257
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,350
to highlight a very small batch

258
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:57,929
specialized nobody touched it except the

259
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,670
farmer from plant to jar when you get it

260
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:01,888
you're the next human to touch it since

261
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:03,659
the person who loved it that's meant to

262
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:05,698
be an ultra small batch we're turning

263
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:08,009
away anything more than ten pounds and

264
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:10,769
so to have these different channels to

265
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:12,480
explore the small batch to explore the

266
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:14,850
art and the craft while putting this

267
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,379
bedrock of a house brand underneath of

268
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,509
it we think that this two-way

269
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:20,399
conversation between farmer and consumer

270
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:23,850
is going to produce what we all want

271
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,649
which is tons of choices that's really

272
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,259
what this is all about so we're pretty

273
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:30,149
sure we might get there if not we'll you

274
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:33,809
know have fun growing good flour on the

275
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:35,789
way and just to break it down a little

276
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:37,289
bit in terms of you know for instance on

277
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:39,929
farm like I'm not packaging into eighths

278
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:42,149
it's it's not cost-effective it's not

279
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:45,208
time effective but if I can do half

280
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:47,490
ounce and ounce increments and you know

281
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:49,528
take the big leaf off so but it's

282
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,240
minimally processed that's something

283
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:53,850
that I can still accomplish on farm at a

284
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,500
small scale and so the goal like

285
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,540
Hezekiah said it's to minimize the

286
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,629
packaging cost by going a larger unit

287
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:02,159
and minimize the processing costs so

288
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:04,019
that I can still do it on farm myself

289
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,120
without having a commercial building and

290
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,828
a crew which for a lot of small farms at

291
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,078
this point is very difficult like I

292
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:12,059
don't have a commercial building and so

293
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,909
to try to figure out a way to keep some

294
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:17,849
of that value on farm by being able to

295
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:19,948
do you know the those those steps and so

296
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,920
and and ideally to be able to deliver to

297
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:24,179
the consumer something that's cured

298
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,429
excellently that's in a larger

299
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,809
unit size that is at a valuable price so

300
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:29,879
that because what we're all seeing out

301
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:31,829
there is like patients who are and and

302
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,439
consumers who are paying these huge

303
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:37,110
prices for small amounts of weed and

304
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,060
it's like man that's that kind of cuts

305
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,909
out the tradition of the thing and so

306
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:43,528
the goal like I say is to be able to

307
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:49,289
hold value on the farm and also get

308
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:50,519
value to the consumer you bring up a

309
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:52,458
good point I went into one of my first

310
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,240
dispensaries the other night and

311
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:57,179
thankfully I don't have to go into

312
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,060
dispensaries but it was it was a it was

313
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:01,649
an experience oh it was a but give

314
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:03,689
thanks to all the dispensary owners yes

315
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,570
absolutely absolutely because not

316
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:08,190
everybody has the opportunity to to grow

317
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,560
all their own and one of the things that

318
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,850
that I really experienced while being in

319
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,500
there well there was a couple things and

320
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,750
I've been saying this for years its its

321
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,669
how do we tell our story and more

322
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,220
importantly how do we communicate that

323
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:22,169
story to the consumer because our best

324
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,389
friend is small farmers as an educated

325
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:26,159
consumer because once they're educated

326
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:27,929
about the product they can make the

327
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,689
decision of who they want to support and

328
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:31,439
what products they want to buy but

329
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,690
overwhelmingly when I was in this

330
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,209
dispensary it's just a bunch of boxes

331
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,950
and some guy that's doing his best to

332
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:40,469
tell me everything about it but really

333
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,150
at the end of the day you know I would

334
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:46,110
just look at what what's the coolest box

335
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:48,600
you know so so how are you guys working

336
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:51,509
with your farmers to tell not only the

337
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:56,040
story of the coop but the story of the

338
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:58,620
farmer well I mean I've stopped going to

339
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:02,129
cannabis events which you know a lot of

340
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,750
you know that I speak a lot you're an

341
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:06,778
exception I'll come to any event you

342
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:09,179
host ever but these days I talk to other

343
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:11,039
folks because like the cannabis

344
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:14,159
community it probably already has access

345
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,099
to cannabis let's be real it's the rest

346
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,629
of the consumers that need and it's sort

347
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,370
of like Casey's don't know you don't

348
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:22,019
know thing earlier there's a lot of

349
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,610
consumers out there that don't know that

350
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,588
they don't know where their cannabis

351
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,259
comes from and you don't even actually

352
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:30,990
the cool thing at least for me like I

353
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:32,850
don't actually have to push a farm I can

354
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,278
just say hey cooperative cannabis you

355
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:37,379
guys like go check out a co-op and then

356
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:37,769
it doesn't matter you know which shop

357
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:39,720
your

358
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:41,339
in where in the state it might be happy

359
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,589
day it might be down-home it might be

360
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,989
somebody totally else but having that

361
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:47,730
cooperative that recognizable center of

362
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:50,459
gravity that we can all come back to

363
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,069
that we know means values means culture

364
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:55,438
I think just you know the more it feels

365
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:57,028
putting my consumer hat on because I am

366
00:13:55,438 --> 00:13:59,099
a consumer of lots of things

367
00:13:57,028 --> 00:14:00,600
cannabis one of them I don't like it

368
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,720
when people tell me here smoke mine it's

369
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,610
the best but if you let me smoke it and

370
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,739
I decide it's the best then cool I'm

371
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,419
stoked and so you know show somebody the

372
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:11,639
door don't tell them which door to walk

373
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:14,208
through has has really been you know my

374
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,209
approach on that

375
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,059
you
