1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:05,040
hey everyone uh thank you for joining us

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,660
today my name is Brian hesterman with

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,000
Inspire and I'll be hosting today's

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,919
webinar and Q a session

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,599
as we learned in part one growing

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:14,160
cannabis inside a sealed room is a

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,019
highly complex interdisciplinary

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,339
challenge that Bridges engineering with

9
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,739
Biology

10
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:22,079
a plant is not just a biologic organism

11
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,879
it is also a physical object that is

12
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,038
subject to the same physical laws the

13
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,778
government matter such as the law of

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,300
conservation of energy

15
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,920
as such energy in indoor plant

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,840
environments is neither created nor

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,579
destroyed but rather converted from one

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,680
form to another

19
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,840
for example when light is provided to a

20
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,219
plant a small amount of that energy is

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,600
absorbed by the plant's leaves for

22
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,340
photosynthesis

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,439
and much of that energy gets converted

24
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,239
into evaporation

25
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,939
so how do we maintain an optimal water

26
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,099
balance and manage plant evaporation to

27
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,198
ensure production outputs and quality

28
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,239
are maximized while lowering costs of

29
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,058
production through efficiency and

30
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:02,280
reductions in labor

31
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:03,538
the answer to that question is it

32
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,400
depends

33
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,320
every project is different in a

34
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,478
multitude of ways

35
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,099
there is no one-size-fits-all approach

36
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:12,420
and there is no single manufacturer that

37
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:14,280
can build the right system for every

38
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,560
project

39
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,599
today's presentation is part two of our

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,700
two-part series and we'll be focused on

41
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,099
the engineering side of the equation the

42
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,060
system and how control is achieved we'll

43
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:29,219
cover General HVAC system considerations

44
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,019
hvacc system types and components and

45
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,640
we'll touch on design and implementation

46
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:34,500
if we have time

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,299
this will be new content for some and

48
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,280
review for others and the goal is to

49
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,360
provide a solid a solid foundation of

50
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,280
important environmental control

51
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,900
requirements that should be considered

52
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,000
and how Inspire can help your project

53
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,240
with a diverse lineup of purpose-built

54
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,280
HVAC systems and controls

55
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,379
okay just to quickly set the stage for

56
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,478
the presentation this talk will focus on

57
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,699
environmental control for indoor

58
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,859
cultivation only not greenhouses

59
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,840
while many of today's Concepts still

60
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,399
apply to greenhouses Greenhouse

61
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,939
environmental control strategies for

62
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,219
another talk we're also dealing with

63
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:10,818
sealed Grow rooms where we have complete

64
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,259
control over all growth parameters

65
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:16,439
there's no outdoor air and normal

66
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:18,620
operation in the air within the room is

67
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,939
fully recirculating

68
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,039
and that's mainly because we're

69
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,079
supplementing narrow CO2 to maximize

70
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,179
carbon assimilation and the growth rate

71
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,920
of the plant

72
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,680
these sealed rooms can be either single

73
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:35,098
level or multi-tier and the focus of

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,540
today is is on cannabis but a lot of the

75
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:39,000
Core Concepts that we've covered today

76
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:41,039
can also apply to any other crop that

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,959
has grown indoors

78
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,318
today's webinar will be presented by

79
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,300
inspires Adrian giovanco and inspires

80
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,458
lead applications engineer and product

81
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,800
specialist joji Singh will be joining

82
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,539
for Q a after the presentation

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,920
without further Ado I'll hand it over to

84
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:57,919
Adrian take it away AG

85
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,738
thanks Brian welcome everybody great to

86
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,140
see you all thanks for joining today

87
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,300
we've got a lot to cover so we're going

88
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:07,439
to jump right in this is part two the

89
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,239
system

90
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,340
I'm going to drop off camera for this

91
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,840
portion to save bandwidth but we'll come

92
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,840
back on for the Q a

93
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,459
so our primary objective is to design

94
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,099
sell and commission mechanical systems

95
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,259
that serve indoor plant environments and

96
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,839
allow for Optimum plant performance

97
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,519
secondary metabolite production and

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,800
long-term profitability

99
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,259
these facilities are True Manufacturing

100
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,900
factories that produce high quality food

101
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:38,459
Recreational Products and medicine on an

102
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,739
industrial scale

103
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,239
with homage paid to a book that we draw

104
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,580
inspiration from called plant

105
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,739
empowerment we view our role as

106
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,500
supporting plant balances not

107
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,658
controlling air conditions the real art

108
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,479
of good growing is to support the plant

109
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:56,878
in maintaining its balances in such a

110
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,798
way that all factors for growth are

111
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,539
optimal at the same time

112
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,580
we're here to build on our part one

113
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:05,098
webinar where we broke down all the

114
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,840
needs of cultivation and curing spaces

115
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:08,878
and as we've shared we must not do this

116
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,700
in a vacuum which is why everything we

117
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,739
do here needs to be squarely focused on

118
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,079
all the important plant focused topics

119
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,120
that we covered in part one

120
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,400
with this solid foundation let's spend

121
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,379
some time exploring the process by which

122
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,918
the most appropriate mechanical systems

123
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:28,259
are sized selected and controlled to

124
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,299
serve these cultivation and curing rooms

125
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,100
based on what we learned in part one the

126
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,960
mechanical systems need to have the

127
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,780
ability to do all of the things shown on

128
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:40,739
the slide in each room dehumidify cool

129
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:43,258
heat humidify enrich with CO2 clean the

130
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,300
air distribute the air for homogeneous

131
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,180
air environment and most importantly

132
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,699
collect cultivation room level data so

133
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,680
that we know what is working what needs

134
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,780
attention and how we can use feedback

135
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,300
from the plants to optimize production

136
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,099
so can one system do all these things in

137
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,139
an integrated fashion or do you need

138
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,460
separate pieces of equipment let's dig

139
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,918
into that

140
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,959
for decades HVAC equipment has been

141
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,120
designed to keep humans comfortable thus

142
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,339
the term Comfort cooling systems

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,079
subsequently specialized process and

144
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,239
Manufacturing environments developed to

145
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,399
require specific environments

146
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,040
since people feel temperature more than

147
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,620
humidity and since we generate heat the

148
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,180
majority of HVAC systems are designed to

149
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,879
cool only

150
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,220
additionally most process environments

151
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,399
produce a lot of heat think data centers

152
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,340
so these process oriented Solutions also

153
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:38,339
tend to be more sensible cooling Centric

154
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:40,079
indoor plant environments are special in

155
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,239
the sense that they have living and

156
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,139
breathing organisms that happen to be

157
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,538
immobile

158
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,240
so consistent ratios of temperature and

159
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:50,459
light on a day-to-day basis is key to

160
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,199
Performance and while you may not feel

161
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:54,060
it in a forest plants are giving off

162
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,400
virtually all of the moisture that their

163
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,780
Roots uptake each plant or tree is an

164
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,478
evaporative cooler

165
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:02,219
this dehumidification heavy load is a

166
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,800
big reason why the mechanical systems

167
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,020
that serve them must be specialized

168
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,600
on top of the large moisture removal

169
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:11,939
requirement these rooms also have a very

170
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,100
Dynamic load profile between lights on

171
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:16,560
and lights off periods and the beginning

172
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,120
stages of vegetative growth to the end

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,038
of the flowering cycle

174
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,899
for the flowering Cycles which dominate

175
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:25,019
the facility space needs in these

176
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:27,299
facilities the load completely flips 180

177
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,859
degrees every 12 hours

178
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,020
now there's a concept from part one

179
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,600
that's worth repeating and much like the

180
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,339
law of minimum for plant growth the

181
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,800
productivity of an indoor cultivation

182
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:39,959
facility is determined by its greatest

183
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,939
limiting factor or its most

184
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,159
underperforming system

185
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:46,139
in our experience the greatest limiting

186
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,479
factor for most indoor facilities today

187
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,160
is their mechanical systems or their

188
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,959
ability to control the temperature and

189
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,120
humidity of their rooms

190
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,038
the Improvement of mechanical systems

191
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,720
presents the greatest opportunity to

192
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,060
maximize the productivity for indoor

193
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,919
cultivation businesses and this is

194
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,839
exactly why Inspire was founded to

195
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,599
develop and deliver purpose-built

196
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,579
systems and controls that are assets and

197
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,900
valuable tools for Growers and not a

198
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,699
liability

199
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:13,560
now on the next slide let's explore some

200
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,960
of the specific differences between the

201
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,139
two types of facilities and systems

202
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,818
Comfort cooling HVAC and HVAC and

203
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,098
dehumidification systems meant for

204
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,720
indoor plant environments so on the left

205
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:26,579
side you'll see attributes for the HVAC

206
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,919
systems for Comfort Cooling and on the

207
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,538
right for indoor plant environments this

208
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,519
whole conversation starts with the need

209
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:34,500
for both temperature and humidity

210
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,698
control also viewed through the lens of

211
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,439
VPD

212
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,579
rather than just temperature control

213
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,978
only

214
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:42,839
as such plant-centric sequence of

215
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:45,000
operations are required to respond to

216
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,219
the needs of the living organisms whose

217
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,959
needs are constantly changing and to

218
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,039
manage the rest of the items on this

219
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,079
list

220
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:54,779
sensible heat ratios are very different

221
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:58,079
50 50 Cooling and dehumidification

222
00:07:54,779 --> 00:08:01,339
versus 85 or 90 percent and 10 to 15

223
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,339
percent dehumidification

224
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,879
in which requires airflow in the coils

225
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:08,219
to be sized appropriately

226
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,839
we have high number of air changes in

227
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,880
the sense of how these spaces view air

228
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,638
changes these are 100 recirculating

229
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:18,060
systems but we are changing out the air

230
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:21,478
every two to three minutes in a 20 to 30

231
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,519
air changes per hour rate versus two to

232
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:26,098
three air changes per hour

233
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,019
this is a very Dynamic load between day

234
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:31,199
and night and that requires variable

235
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:33,059
capacity control both on cooling reheat

236
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,278
airflow

237
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,899
where fixed capacity is okay in many

238
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,240
cases otherwise

239
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,458
and reheat is required in order to

240
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,440
deliver room neutral air conditions and

241
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,359
keep the plants in conditions optimal

242
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,760
for growth when we eliminate

243
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,860
dehumidifiers we're needing to reheat

244
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,600
that air back up whereas in Comfort

245
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,459
cooling applications you can deliver

246
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,399
much colder air

247
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:58,500
and in this case CO2 is plant food and

248
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,860
costs money to introduce thus air

249
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,659
economizers are typically not applicable

250
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,820
biosiltration and air cleaning is

251
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:08,039
extremely important must be included the

252
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,080
state laws differ but universally strict

253
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,120
lab testing requirements and lack of

254
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,639
ability to use pesticides on this crop

255
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,440
because it is ingested can lead to large

256
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,519
crop loss resulting from pests and

257
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,959
pathogens

258
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,580
like everything in this unique

259
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,099
application the whole process is

260
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,200
interconnected by creating a culture of

261
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,300
clean and improving the cleanliness of

262
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,759
the air environment within effective

263
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:32,039
biofiltration systems you can reduce or

264
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,500
eliminate preventative sprays and the

265
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,179
labor costs associated with them

266
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,860
so now that we know what functions are

267
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:39,778
required and how the needs differ from

268
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,519
typical Comfort cooling to process

269
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:43,620
cooling systems

270
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,720
let's take an important sanity check

271
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,039
with regards to the cultivation business

272
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,899
needs

273
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,879
so with the complex and

274
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,159
multi-disciplinary challenge that we are

275
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,320
faced with as an environmental can as

276
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:58,199
environmental system Architects so to

277
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,459
speak designers and Builders and with so

278
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,580
many different types of system

279
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:04,379
variations to consider we must base our

280
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,060
decision-making process on the most

281
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,700
important factors first

282
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:11,099
key performance indicators or kpis are

283
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,660
used to set the Baseline targets and

284
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,339
they must be continuously tracked

285
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:16,019
starting from the first cycle

286
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,000
we like to recommend using the second

287
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,039
flower cycle as the true test of the

288
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,778
benchmarks that were set since it is

289
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,939
very challenging to load test these

290
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:27,179
spaces and commission them properly with

291
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,000
plants and real load before bringing in

292
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,079
your your first run and starting to

293
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,879
cultivate

294
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,560
so we suggest for our clients to really

295
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,179
try to simulate that load in the space

296
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,919
as best as possible during the

297
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:39,479
commissioning process but it's not

298
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,059
always practical

299
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,980
what of these attributes do cultivation

300
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,838
businesses need to succeed

301
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,759
we regularly pull cultivators and

302
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,860
cannabis business owners and out of this

303
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,458
long list the attributes that come back

304
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,740
on the top of the list are quality

305
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:59,299
consistency speed to Market

306
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,299
lowest operating cost

307
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,079
on the point of reduced cost of

308
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,000
production it is very important to not

309
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,399
forget about building efficiency into

310
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,860
your facility from the start and taking

311
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,139
advantage of capex offsets from the

312
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,200
utility or state to help improve

313
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,939
efficiency and reduce cost of production

314
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,860
this is where indoor and vertical

315
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,260
farming industry can truly participate

316
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,419
in the triple bottom line concept that

317
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:25,679
sustainable facility design can be good

318
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:27,719
for business

319
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,859
good for the environment and good for

320
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,000
the consumers

321
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,379
so that's been a couple of minutes

322
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,799
digging into these details around

323
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:37,500
efficiency and incentives for offsets

324
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,578
dehumidification is an energy intensive

325
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,519
process

326
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:43,739
the HVAC dehumidification systems can

327
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,500
comprise up to 50 to 60 percent of the

328
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,480
total facility energy consumption and as

329
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,078
that's rolled up that total energy

330
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,959
accounts for 20 to 40 percent of your

331
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:57,778
operating cost the HVAC portion of the

332
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,699
energy accounts for your total total of

333
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:01,559
20 to 40 percent of your total operating

334
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,259
costs costs in a cultivation facility

335
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,179
and investing in efficient HVAC and

336
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:09,179
dehumidification systems lowers your

337
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:11,099
operating cost per pound in perpetuity

338
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:12,659
efficient systems are what you need to

339
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,879
weather the storm of price compression

340
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:16,379
and supply and demand imbalances which

341
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,139
are guaranteed to happen as state

342
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:21,000
markets mature most existing facilities

343
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,679
today are not built to make it through

344
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,259
these challenges

345
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,599
by investing up front you can keep your

346
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:29,399
costs down don't expose yourself to

347
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
these risks by doing it right the first

348
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,700
time

349
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,800
the utility and tax incentive programs

350
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,879
offer free money and are only getting

351
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,759
better

352
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:41,100
custom rebates are available now in all

353
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,319
states prescriptive rebates are coming

354
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,019
in many geographies

355
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,820
Peak demand reduction incentives are

356
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:50,220
very significant right now in California

357
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,440
for the next year and in a number of

358
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,180
other states this could be as simple as

359
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,339
scheduling your light cycles outside of

360
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:58,439
the peak demand hours or implementing

361
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,620
controls retrofits

362
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:05,040
combined heat and power or CHP systems

363
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:07,860
can gain both tax incentives and utility

364
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,078
rebates for the same project which is a

365
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,000
real win-win and we see more and more

366
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:15,719
cultivation facilities taking advantage

367
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,820
of CHP systems as they can in many cases

368
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,399
be the most financially viable solution

369
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,139
to get a project financed and built

370
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,078
within a reasonable timeline

371
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,879
plus we get all of our reheat for free

372
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:28,679
a utility incentive programs are

373
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,480
developing fast so stay apprised of

374
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,519
programs in your area and connect with

375
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,620
utility providers early

376
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,659
now let's not forget that we don't

377
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,778
design efficiency into the overall

378
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:41,639
system just for the sake of efficiency

379
00:13:38,778 --> 00:13:44,338
we must focus on the plant productivity

380
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,600
first and then find ways to do it

381
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,160
efficiently

382
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,420
and a little foreshadowing one for

383
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,699
what's to come today but since we

384
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:53,639
Embrace an integrated design approach

385
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,959
from the pre-construction stage we

386
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,720
actually can do both of those

387
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,859
successfully

388
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,959
now that we've got all the business

389
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,560
level needs ranked we have to make sure

390
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,899
that those track with you know uh mixing

391
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,759
in sustainability and efficiency and the

392
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,399
kpis and all of that we've just

393
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,860
discussed we have to make sure that that

394
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,200
is all going to jive with the system

395
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,959
considerations that the owner and client

396
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,060
are looking for

397
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:23,399
and the building and site design

398
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:25,018
constraints which you see system

399
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,179
considerations on the left and can

400
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:29,039
design constraints on the right Capital

401
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:30,659
cost and operating costs are extremely

402
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,039
important you got to get it right the

403
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:34,139
first time

404
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,360
HVAC is typically the largest capital

405
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,940
investment on a project and it is also

406
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,740
one of the most expensive to retrofit

407
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,019
and there are really so many different

408
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,180
competing factors here where do you go

409
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:47,100
through level of control efficiency

410
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:50,099
sustainability like we just discussed

411
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,079
the reliability durability complexity

412
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,959
maintenance requirements who's going to

413
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:58,379
maintain it how is your phasing set up

414
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,299
for future phases and build out

415
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,338
um and are you focused on GMP

416
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,519
cleanliness standards

417
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:07,260
all of that has to be

418
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:09,419
transitioned into how we're actually

419
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:11,578
going to apply this into this particular

420
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,860
building or site and these design

421
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,419
constraints are what the engineers MEP

422
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,519
engineers and Architects and other

423
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:19,860
design professionals have to work with

424
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,980
them these that you see on the screen

425
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,339
are some of the the items that we see

426
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,620
most often overlooked space and

427
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,399
structural limitations do you have

428
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,320
enough utility power gas are the biggest

429
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,120
water is also very important CO2

430
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,519
availability

431
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,820
property line and neighbor complaints

432
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:44,179
both Odor Control and noise related can

433
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:47,639
sink a project

434
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:51,059
biofiltration and pests exclusion needs

435
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,440
to be considered and very very seriously

436
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:54,359
in areas that are aggregate

437
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,060
agriculturally dense

438
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,620
and the controls integration error

439
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:01,018
distribution uniformity how we're

440
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,039
putting the facility together all takes

441
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:04,320
space

442
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:05,759
now all of these items have to be able

443
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,500
to meet the building and energy code

444
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,078
compliance as well so this is a really

445
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,419
multi multi-disciplinary challenge

446
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,638
and it's been said before but it's worth

447
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:16,198
repeating that it's imperative to get

448
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,360
this done right the first time because

449
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:21,059
of how costly and challenging it is to

450
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,320
retrofit the HVAC systems

451
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,059
so let's start looking at some different

452
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,100
types of systems that are used commonly

453
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:28,018
in cultivation facilities

454
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,820
the first place to start here is with

455
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,919
what we call non-integrated systems

456
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,980
these can also be called conventional

457
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,838
non-integrated decoupled or Legacy

458
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,879
systems now during prohibition

459
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,680
cultivators were forced indoors to hide

460
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,838
from law enforcement and due to that

461
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,819
illegality they could not engage

462
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:47,699
Engineers or commercial HVAC system

463
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,500
providers or HVAC technicians to design

464
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:51,479
and install mechanical systems to

465
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,458
control these spaces properly and this

466
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,139
really led to a do-it-yourself mentality

467
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:57,119
and propensity for using what was

468
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,820
available and specifically we're talking

469
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,339
about off-the-shelf residential

470
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,540
people Comfort cooling systems used in

471
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:06,298
conjunction with Standalone

472
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,798
dehumidifiers and oscillating wall fans

473
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:09,779
all of this gear can be bought at a

474
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:11,519
local Hydra shop or Home Depot

475
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:14,039
for the cooling equipment it can be

476
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:17,639
packaged rooftop units split systems

477
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:20,220
Mini Splits vrf systems or two pipe

478
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,679
chill water fan coils all these systems

479
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,360
are cooling devices and control off of a

480
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,519
thermostat only

481
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,279
Standalone dehumidifiers are required

482
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,859
then to augment these HVAC units and

483
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,440
they're heating only based on rejecting

484
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:36,719
the heat of compression from the

485
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,058
dehumidifier into the space

486
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,679
and the AC units now have to be sized

487
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,599
appropriately to remove this heat

488
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,580
rejected by the dehumidifier which is

489
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:47,339
roughly 30 percent additional

490
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:48,980
so several issues persist with this type

491
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:51,298
of system configuration

492
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,640
sub-optimal control

493
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:56,220
in this relative humidity Spike at

494
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,500
lights off every night where powdery

495
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,440
mildew and botrytus can develop

496
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,599
it we see uncontrolled microclimates and

497
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,980
uneven airflow and poor air mixing in

498
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,079
these spaces

499
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,058
they're inherently inefficient based on

500
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:11,038
that 30 percent extra heat load to

501
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:13,079
remove from the dehumidifiers as I

502
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,179
mentioned and these systems are really

503
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,460
fighting against each other because it's

504
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,740
challenging to control

505
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,319
there's pathogen risks with this type of

506
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,120
design since your technicians will be

507
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,099
working on the mechanical equipment

508
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,939
above the canopy as you see in the

509
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:29,279
picture

510
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,558
and condensate leaks are routinely

511
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:35,460
dripping into the plants which is a

512
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:38,160
common opportunity for water molds

513
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,019
sanitation between the Cycles is also

514
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,400
very challenging to achieve since

515
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:43,619
there's so much equipment in the room

516
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,720
and so many surfaces to clean

517
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:47,939
so these these all challenges really beg

518
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,279
the question can we do it better you

519
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,200
know as experienced HVAC Engineers we

520
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:55,440
know that we have the technology to do

521
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,179
it better so why wouldn't we some say

522
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,160
that the first cost savings and many

523
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,240
small redundant units are worth the

524
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,700
trade-off

525
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,220
the data tells us otherwise and the

526
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,798
industry is maturing too quickly to not

527
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,900
take advantage of today's Technologies

528
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:11,879
let's get into how we can mitigate these

529
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,860
challenges and hit the mark with the

530
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,740
owner requirements for their business

531
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:18,839
operational efficiency that we discussed

532
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,900
earlier and make it a high performance

533
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,279
and sustainable system

534
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,900
Now quickly before we move past

535
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,339
non-integrated systems for the rest of

536
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,380
the presentation I do want to mention

537
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:30,779
that for the hundreds and thousands of

538
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,299
rooms across North America that are

539
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:35,879
already built with these systems HVAC

540
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:39,418
controls retrofits and sub canopy

541
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,840
Airflow Systems maybe some of the best

542
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:45,660
ways to get reliable data and better

543
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,459
control from these existing systems and

544
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,558
to be able to apply a plant-centric

545
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,538
sequence of operations

546
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:53,339
put together an action plan to

547
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:55,679
supplement additional capacity if the

548
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:57,779
systems are undersized and utilize open

549
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,538
source architecture for Control Systems

550
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:04,200
to be able to integrate into future

551
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:06,359
retrofits of the full HVAC systems

552
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,600
um as additional Capital becomes

553
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,599
available

554
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:14,099
these controls and airflow retrofits can

555
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:16,439
often be supported by the utility rebate

556
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:18,298
programs that we touched on which really

557
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,058
helps to offset those investment costs

558
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:25,500
further and improves the rois

559
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:27,418
so now let's dig into Integrated Systems

560
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,940
here we graduate to what we term

561
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:33,840
integrated HVAC and dehumidification

562
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:36,179
systems or hvacd which highlights the

563
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,519
importance of dehumidification in this

564
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:40,559
process we see these also being called

565
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,379
reheat systems based on the use of hot

566
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,178
gas reheat in that case the heat is

567
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,679
recovered off the compressor that would

568
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,679
have been sent out to the condenser to

569
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,360
be rejected to ambient this is a DX or

570
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,640
direct expansion system we'll go into

571
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,259
those in more depth in a moment hydronic

572
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,480
systems are another type of integrated

573
00:20:55,259 --> 00:21:00,179
system but we must be specific with our

574
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,038
language and naming conventions for pipe

575
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:04,919
hydronic system versus a two-pipe

576
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:07,259
hydronic system which is integrated a

577
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,538
four pipe and two pipe is a cooling only

578
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:11,339
supporting a non-integrated system we'll

579
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:13,980
get into more of this in a moment

580
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:16,379
as HVAC engineering professionals we

581
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,599
know that a well-engineered system is

582
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,160
the best solution when faced with such a

583
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,159
multi-faceted design and construction

584
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,620
challenge a properly designed integrated

585
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,320
system provides cooling Heating and

586
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:29,219
dehumidification in a single engineered

587
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,259
system

588
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,360
since all of this is happening in

589
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:35,460
integrated air handling units we can

590
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,399
treat all the air in each room for pests

591
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,440
and pathogens on a continuous basis and

592
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
keep the grow room clean with no four

593
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,860
materials to clean

594
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,779
remember that errors are being exchanged

595
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:48,298
every two to three minutes

596
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,038
with an integrated system we get the

597
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:51,839
benefits of a tightly controlled and

598
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:53,819
homogeneous air environment with

599
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,339
controlled transitions between photo

600
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:58,918
periods we get to pick up inherent

601
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:01,079
efficiency gains in the 30 to 40 percent

602
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:04,140
range compared to non-integrated systems

603
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:06,720
by removing Standalone dehumidifiers

604
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:10,740
we focus on the systems being right

605
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,058
sized and reusing energy and water in

606
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,859
any way possible

607
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:16,379
it really sounds too good to be true

608
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:18,359
right but we can balance all these

609
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,220
spinning plates with a simple and

610
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:21,779
elegant system design

611
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,220
first I thought it would be good to

612
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:25,740
quickly examine

613
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,620
two rooms from a recent client

614
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:31,259
side-by-side study

615
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:33,658
this is an example of an integrated HVAC

616
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:35,339
system on the top left versus a

617
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:36,720
conventional non-integrated system on

618
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:38,099
the bottom right and what the control

619
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,140
Trends look like

620
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:43,500
this is two different flower rooms both

621
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:45,900
in week four using LED lights both in a

622
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,779
two-tier racking system the same week in

623
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,120
June of last year at the same facility

624
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:53,639
note the relative humidity spikes of 15

625
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,979
to 20 percent every time the lights go

626
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,320
out which is a critical transition point

627
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,120
in these Dynamic spaces the relative

628
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,558
humidity line is the purple line and the

629
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,658
trend on the bottom right

630
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:05,038
and you can see much tighter control of

631
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:06,659
relative humidity through these

632
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,538
transitions

633
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:11,580
and with the integrated system note the

634
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:14,158
speed to the control points or how

635
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:16,139
quickly set points can be achieved

636
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,700
but the most important part with this

637
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,919
whole story is that the one on the

638
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,140
bottom right was getting 28 grams a

639
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,659
square foot of sellable flour and the

640
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:27,000
one on the top left is getting 55 grams

641
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:29,100
a square foot consistently we've got

642
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,259
double the yields with integrated

643
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:33,240
environmental control

644
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:35,158
now let's go from here to talk about the

645
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,200
different types of Integrated Systems

646
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,799
that we deploy as a comprehensive

647
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Solutions provider

648
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:45,960
this type of system is called DX which

649
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,640
stands for direct expansion this is the

650
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,038
type of home air conditioner you likely

651
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,740
have it contains the Full Refrigeration

652
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:55,500
circuit in each unit or system

653
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,599
this can be a split system or a packaged

654
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,880
unit it can come in an air-cooled

655
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,798
variety with the air cooled condenser or

656
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,440
a water cooled condenser

657
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:06,960
and in general error code DX is the most

658
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,779
common system that we see today due to

659
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,819
lower first cost technician familiarity

660
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:14,460
and shorter lead times

661
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:16,678
however we see it transitioning to

662
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,840
hydronic systems and will continue to

663
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,480
transition more as the market matures

664
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:23,579
into True Manufacturing facilities at

665
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,960
scale that need to prove they

666
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:27,119
manufactured their products at

667
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,798
facilities that can be validated by

668
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,199
regulatory bodies

669
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:35,339
we advocate for our clients to be ready

670
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,960
to meet gmps if they so desire from the

671
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:39,899
minute they turn on their facility and

672
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,960
we we enable them to do that

673
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,759
we offer our canopy canopy plus and

674
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,740
preservation product lines in both air

675
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:49,259
cooled and water cooled DX systems to

676
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,700
meet our clients diverse needs you can

677
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:52,740
see a few different form factors

678
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,500
installed in these pictures from left to

679
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,440
right DX package unit on the left

680
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:01,200
to a water cooled energy recovery system

681
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,000
in the middle to an air-cooled DX split

682
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,919
system on the top right

683
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,740
and remember these are all Integrated

684
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,179
Systems but just in different flavors

685
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,000
so now let's look at the other type

686
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:13,740
hydraulic systems

687
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,140
terminology here like I mentioned before

688
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,359
is really important is it called chilled

689
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,759
water or hot water systems or hydronic

690
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,859
systems or you hear the terms four pipe

691
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:24,960
or two pipe thrown around which you see

692
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:28,439
in the diagram on the top right is four

693
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,058
pipes where you have in this case you

694
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,340
have six pipes because it's a water

695
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:34,619
cooled Chiller but on the load side to

696
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:37,500
the air handling units you have four

697
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:40,199
pipes two for cooling two for heating

698
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,058
chilled water and hot water a two pipe

699
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,880
system is only going to provide you one

700
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:47,879
or the other at a time so that would be

701
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,799
more in the non-integrated camp or a

702
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,600
four pipe system would allow you to do

703
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,460
integrated control

704
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,980
now these chillers and the chiller

705
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:59,340
plants can be air cooled or they can be

706
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:02,700
water cooled they can be electrically

707
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:05,399
driven or they can be gas driven and

708
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,140
heat recovery is available on all of

709
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,960
these types of chillers which means we

710
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,538
don't need to pay money or use resources

711
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,058
for reheat these systems are very

712
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:17,819
customizable to meet your site needs as

713
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:20,038
far as space considerations and phasing

714
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:22,439
and better Precision control is

715
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:24,960
available via modulating water valves

716
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,200
which really allow for infinite variable

717
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,519
capacity control

718
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,058
optimization opportunities exist for

719
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:35,038
sizing and overall system and for your

720
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:37,319
facility because you can size your plant

721
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,778
based on the Block load of your facility

722
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:41,759
rather than the peak load which allows

723
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:44,460
you to shave 20 to 30 percent of the

724
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,379
total capacity off of the plant

725
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,360
There's an opportunity for phasing

726
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,820
particularly with modular chillers and

727
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:53,099
pumps which allows for additional

728
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:54,119
redundancy as well as you build out your

729
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:56,038
plant

730
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,839
we typically see these systems being

731
00:26:56,038 --> 00:27:01,500
chosen when the total facility size

732
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:03,178
reaches maybe 300 to 400 tons total

733
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,980
I want you to take note of the gas fire

734
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:07,200
Chiller on the bottom of the slide with

735
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,599
a partner of ours called ticogen

736
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,000
this animal uses natural gas to produce

737
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,558
chilled water with no middlemen and

738
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,720
business owners that proactively

739
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:17,940
understand their utility rate structure

740
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,058
and the relative costs of electricity

741
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,038
gas and water in comparison to each

742
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:24,538
other can make the best financial

743
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,058
decisions

744
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:29,700
and many times those projects end up

745
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:31,798
including a gas-fired Cellar plant

746
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,720
let's compare and contrast what we just

747
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:36,778
learned about these two types of systems

748
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,460
quickly both integrated but different

749
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:40,798
on the left we have the attributes

750
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,840
related to DX systems and the hydronic

751
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,778
systems are on the right we talked about

752
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:48,058
the individual DX circuits per room and

753
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:50,240
per unit and the many distributed DX

754
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:53,399
circuits to maintain versus

755
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,419
consolidation and fewer at a chiller

756
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,519
plant

757
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:58,080
we talked about good control versus

758
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,319
precise control

759
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:03,599
we talked about redundancy

760
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:05,460
and how its can be applied where a

761
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,859
direct expansion on a room by room unit

762
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,620
basis you would need an additional unit

763
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:12,479
on every single room rather than

764
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:13,199
building in redundancy into the chiller

765
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,839
plant

766
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,360
and we do have a lower first cost for

767
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:21,899
direct expansion systems

768
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:24,719
but the return on investment breaks even

769
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,480
really at about 15 to 20 000 square feet

770
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,700
of canopy and Facilities of any size

771
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,500
larger should always be looking at

772
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,798
hydronic systems

773
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,240
both systems required skilled mechanical

774
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,720
technicians

775
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,640
to maintain and both systems need

776
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,220
engaged and experienced design and

777
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,259
construction and maintenance teams this

778
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,819
is not just something for one type of

779
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:49,500
system or the other

780
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:52,139
again you're only as good as your

781
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,558
weakest link so don't let that be your

782
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,538
HVAC system or your HVAC service company

783
00:28:54,558 --> 00:29:00,119
you know retain on a service side retain

784
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:02,158
a yearly contract with your service

785
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:03,599
company so that they can handle routine

786
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,880
preventative maintenance and be

787
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:09,599
available for emergencies at the best

788
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:12,120
rate and can prioritize availability

789
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,558
so what are the ways so what are these

790
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:15,119
the only real ways you know we talked

791
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:17,519
about these two different main types of

792
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,678
systems are there other ways that we can

793
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,319
meet this challenge it's important to

794
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,200
talk about you know there are other

795
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,000
proven Technologies out there

796
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,620
um it's there's no free lunch though

797
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,200
right and there's there's trade-offs

798
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:33,298
with all of these at Inspire we pride

799
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,159
ourselves in a brand agnostic approach

800
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:37,859
that specializes in finding the right

801
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:40,440
system and Enviro HVAC and controls

802
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,839
system for each project it requires

803
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,580
continuous Improvement in Innovation so

804
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:46,139
we're always evaluating all types of

805
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:48,178
Technologies to determine what our

806
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,399
clients can benefit most from

807
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:52,620
but Technologies need to be more than a

808
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,719
great idea or conceptual opportunity for

809
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:57,298
efficiency or other benefits

810
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,159
in order to be commercialized and used

811
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:00,599
on these facilities we must be sure

812
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,520
they're proven for this special

813
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,319
application of indoor plant environments

814
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:07,079
and that they can be cost effective

815
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,298
serviceable reliable

816
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,158
safe to say we're very picky about what

817
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:12,898
we Implement in the field our clients

818
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:15,899
look to us to be their subject matter

819
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:16,558
experts Gatekeepers and sort of a safety

820
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,959
net

821
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,058
we only look to support new Innovations

822
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,058
when we can see positive results in

823
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:25,740
third-party verification and see the

824
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:27,658
systems run in person

825
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,339
with that said there are several proven

826
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,778
dehumidification Technologies on the

827
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:32,398
market that we have found to offer

828
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:35,099
varying levels of opportunity for

829
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,379
sustainable and high performance design

830
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:39,298
all four of the types of energy recovery

831
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,860
devices shown on the slide have a

832
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:43,319
similar efficiency improvement over

833
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:44,459
Baseline but all have unique pros and

834
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:46,379
cons

835
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,259
after careful consideration and field

836
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:52,020
trials our canopy plus line utilizes the

837
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:54,058
water to water runaround coil concept to

838
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,918
recover warm room air

839
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:58,319
which pre-cools the dehumidification

840
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,299
coil and then subsequently reheats the

841
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,619
air off the coil as the first stage of

842
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:03,960
reheat

843
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,879
this results in increased efficiency for

844
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,159
the system of 30 to 50 percent over

845
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,860
Brute Force Cooling and Tighter control

846
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,620
with both air cooled DX water cooled DX

847
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:15,658
or 4-pipe hydronic system options

848
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:17,759
the biggest word of caution with any new

849
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:19,919
technology is the Mandate that you see

850
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,119
it in real life and can truly validate

851
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,860
the performance and claims with

852
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,959
third-party data

853
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:26,219
speaking of third-party testing data I

854
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,819
thought this would be a good transition

855
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:31,919
into one of the places where we see

856
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:33,960
a lot of snake oil in the Cannabis

857
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,940
industry and honestly the whole HVAC

858
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,220
industry now that we've just lived

859
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,720
through a pandemic and that is in air

860
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,519
cleaning devices

861
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,500
like to share the technology we trust

862
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,480
for our plant environments

863
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:49,079
what you see here is a photo catalytic

864
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,538
oxidative air cleaner or PCO for short

865
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:54,240
this air cleaning panel reduces the risk

866
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:56,099
of pests and pathogen contamination and

867
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,319
failing lab tests

868
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:00,058
since cultivators must pass third-party

869
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,980
quality assurance testing and provide

870
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:04,740
coas along with their sellable product

871
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:07,019
it's imperative to Monitor and regulate

872
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,440
the relatively High particulate pest

873
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:13,319
pathogen VOC loads Within These spaces

874
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,000
particulate capture filters of Merv 1314

875
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:17,339
range will typically catch particles

876
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,380
size 1 Micron and larger

877
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:21,898
and we don't don't forget to actually

878
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,880
change those filters on a regular basis

879
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,558
or hire a service contractor to change

880
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,200
them on a schedule

881
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:30,359
but PCO air cleaners are the primary

882
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,100
active biofiltration solution that we

883
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:33,778
incorporate in our systems in

884
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:37,379
conjunction with those passive filters

885
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:40,319
these can be in-room units or induct

886
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:43,020
systems or in-unit systems and typically

887
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,000
duct mounted is chosen since we're

888
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:46,440
already bringing all the air through

889
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,599
these systems and the ducting system

890
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,759
every two to three minutes

891
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:53,879
third-party testing data and validation

892
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:56,158
is required for all Air cool cleaning

893
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,899
technology to be considered

894
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,700
and in addition to the recirculating

895
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:01,619
units serving cultivation and curing

896
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,778
spaces we can apply this air cleaning

897
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:06,119
technology into separate Supply and

898
00:33:03,778 --> 00:33:08,759
exhaust fan filter units that are used

899
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:11,119
to introduce clean outdoor air or Purge

900
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:13,558
gases and handle handle Odor Control

901
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:16,199
rebalance the gas mixture of air in the

902
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:18,000
sealed room or use it as an economizer

903
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,399
sequence if the outside air conditions

904
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,259
may be available

905
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,479
um or we one one spot we see this of

906
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:26,640
most effectively used and is is in an

907
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,500
emergency mode to be able to bring in

908
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,600
outside air as a backup for any

909
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,700
mechanical system failures that need

910
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:34,259
time to repair so we offer all these

911
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,440
different ancillary items with our

912
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:40,319
Integrated Systems as well as a la carte

913
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,558
now speaking about sub canopy air moving

914
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,599
devices I wanted to talk about airflow

915
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:48,240
and air movement

916
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:50,939
when discussing airflow in a cultivation

917
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,919
or curing room we must consider all Air

918
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,080
moving devices serving the space as a

919
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,700
complete system even if they're not

920
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:58,918
physically connected

921
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:02,038
in an integrated system the main air

922
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,899
handler or air handlers are used to

923
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:05,819
condition and circulate air as a

924
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:08,098
component of a heating ventilating and

925
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:09,659
air conditioning system the air handler

926
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:11,580
connects to ductwork that in turn

927
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,679
distributes the conditioned cool dry air

928
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:15,480
throughout the grow space before it

929
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,519
returns to the air handling unit

930
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,858
the movement of air through an indoor

931
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:23,159
grow space is imperative to maintaining

932
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:25,019
a healthy garden without proper airflow

933
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:27,240
plants may not be able to evaporate

934
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:30,719
water at optimal levels stunting

935
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:33,539
photosynthesis and carbon assimilation

936
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:37,019
furthermore areas of high humidity are

937
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:39,179
prone to pest infestation mold or mildew

938
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:42,179
so our goal is to create homogeneous

939
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:44,280
airflow throughout the entire grow space

940
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:47,398
fortunately we can't solely rely on the

941
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,500
HVAC system for the in-room airflow

942
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:51,960
since we're designing that system based

943
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,659
on maximum moisture removal as a means

944
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,760
of making the system as cost effective

945
00:34:54,659 --> 00:35:00,240
as possible

946
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,880
however great care consideration should

947
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:04,858
be taken when designing the supplier and

948
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,720
return air duct configurations within

949
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:09,059
room layout and in-room airflow devices

950
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:11,759
because the room performance depends on

951
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:14,039
it the ductwork approaches and design

952
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,859
differ between single tier and

953
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:19,259
multi-tier rooms sub-canopy Airflow

954
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:21,900
Systems must be used in multi-tier

955
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,820
gardens you can see a cfd modeling of

956
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,740
the sub canopy system that we offer in

957
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,200
the middle of the page

958
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:29,819
top canopy air movement devices should

959
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:32,519
also be considered

960
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:34,740
unit performance depends on a good

961
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:36,780
ductwork design and installation and

962
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:38,699
in-room airflow devices that are

963
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,740
designed together for Optimal

964
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:43,139
Performance we've seen many many

965
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:45,059
different rooms in operation and can

966
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:46,858
help provide suggestions for best

967
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,900
practices in an over-the-shoulder type

968
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:50,819
fashion in collaboration with the

969
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,800
mechanical engineers when we become

970
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,380
engaged in projects and Equipment has

971
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,940
been purchased the cfd models in the

972
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,338
middle of the screen show one such

973
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,780
design concept that we support and in

974
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:02,880
this scenario we're introducing the

975
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,980
supply air into the working aisle on the

976
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,140
right hand side and sending it down the

977
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,539
racks with sub-canopy airflow fans and

978
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:12,179
tubes for the return hour grills to pick

979
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:13,800
up at the other end of each tier and

980
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:16,319
return the air to the air handling units

981
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,780
we typically see rack lengths of less

982
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,359
than 40 feet being best for reducing

983
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,820
microclimates and dedicated return air

984
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:26,759
grills locations for each tier rack

985
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,900
really help bring move the air through

986
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,579
the room

987
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,039
so with so many different permutations

988
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:34,560
of system configurations and ancillary

989
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:37,440
items to integrate how do we know that

990
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:40,078
the room operation will be consistent

991
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,480
well the answer is with accurate data

992
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,660
collection to inform a plant-centric

993
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,519
controls and sequence of operations

994
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:49,199
and we've discussed throughout the

995
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:52,500
presentation today typical Factory

996
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,299

this industry as they're designed for

998
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,780
people comfort

999
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:59,880
we require specialized sequence of

1000
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,500
operations for cannabis and other indoor

1001

plant environments

1002
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,280
it has taken us aggregating and

1003
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:07,199
optimizing the control strategies over

1004
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,660
the past six plus years with a

1005

believe to be the first true

today we implement this standardized

00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:32,819
controller with embedded sequence of

1015
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,400
operation on all of our air handlers

1016
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,320
both hydronic and DX and these can also

1017
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,780
be deployed in a retrofit solution for

1018
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,519
non-integrated systems or onto existing

1019
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,200
integrated air handlers for lower cost

1020
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,539
retrofits

1021
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,059
all the sensor data is collected with

1022
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:51,420
multiple aspirated sensor boxes per tier

1023
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:53,519
and located within the plant canopy this

1024
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,380
data is aggregated in our controllers

1025
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,019
and connected throughout the facility

1026
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,940
with a simple ethernet based Lan which

1027
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:02,759
connects the field devices and allows

1028
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:06,240
for control based sorry cloud-based

1029
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:09,240
control monitoring and alarming the

1030
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,139
sequence of optimization strategies are

1031
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:12,539
many

1032
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:15,960
intelligent set point ramping smooth

1033
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:18,480
transitions speed of change negative and

1034
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,800
positive temperature differentials cold

1035
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,380
air dumps

1036
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,780
gas composition resets room

1037
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,880
pressurization control we've really only

1038
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,500
scratched the surface with crop searing

1039
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,960
techniques that can be implemented

1040
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,539
through the plant's environment back to

1041
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,639
an important concept from part one

1042
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:39,119
genotype or genetics plus environment

1043
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:41,239
equals phenotype everyone is after the

1044
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,619
next hot phenom

1045
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:45,779
environmental control is a fundamental

1046
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:48,420
building block to grow better cannabis

1047
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,400
and to do it more efficiently it is the

1048
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,920
critical first step in a comprehensive

1049
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,440
integrated Pest Management program that

1050
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,700
reduces pathogen pressure and labor

1051
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,000
expenditure

1052
00:38:56,699 --> 00:39:02,480
integrated control is the best form of

1053
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,480
crop insurance

1054
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:08,039
you really only have one chance to do it

1055
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:10,619
right it could be the difference between

1056
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:12,179
building long-term asset value and going

1057
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:16,559
bankrupt frankly

1058
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:18,838
the industry is really on a knife's edge

1059
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:21,299
competition is increasing prices are

1060
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:23,639
plummeting margins are shrinking and you

1061
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,680
can't afford to do it wrong you can't

1062
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:27,239
afford not to spend the money on

1063
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,578
environmental control

1064
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:32,338
this is why Inspire focuses exclusively

1065
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:33,720
on indoor plant environments our team's

1066

1070
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:45,598
environment is not your limiting factor

1071
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,880
I'd like to take this moment to thank

1072
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,820
the individuals and companies who are

1073
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,680

1074
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,260
lighting providers providing the

1075
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:56,819
necessary photons automated fertigation

1076
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,880
companies that have allowed us to

1077
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,559
fine-tune dry backs and mineral balance

1078

and control systems that allow us to see

1081
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:12,299
the impact of precision control in real

1082
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:15,059
time the education and Media Partners

1083
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,160
for sharing knowledge to the industry on

1084
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:19,739
the challenges of day-to-day cultivation

1085
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:21,659
the genetics providers that develop

1086
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:24,059
great cultivars and the

1087
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:26,879
multi-disciplinary Consultants that help

1088
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:29,338
bring entrepreneurs Visions to life

1089
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,039
we talk a lot about integration of

1090
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:34,199
temperature humidity and CO2 but it's

1091
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:36,179
the integration and understanding of all

1092
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:39,358
of these people partners and systems

1093
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:41,219
that make cannabis businesses successful

1094
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:44,299
and with that let's open it up for some

1095
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:44,299
questions right

1096
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,359
all right thanks Adrian lots of good

1097
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:51,059
info there

1098
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:52,679
I've got a question here uh I think they

1099
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:54,599
should be directed to you Joe G how do

1100
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:56,759
outdoor conditions and geography impact

1101
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,800
unit selection and performance yeah

1102
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,540
that's a great question because outdoor

1103
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,000
environments play a big factor in not

1104
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:05,338
just determining what style of units we

1105
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,320
kind of consider for the job but also

1106
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:10,199
what components we're going to select

1107
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,660
for the job and you know this comes this

1108
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:14,098
becomes really important in environments

1109
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:16,500
and geographies with extreme weather

1110
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:20,400
conditions so for example let's take the

1111
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:22,739
Northeast as an example Northeast as we

1112
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,420
know during winter times it can go below

1113
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:26,879
freezing and then during the Summers

1114
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,820
they can go above 90 sometimes even up

1115
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,960
close to the hundreds and so we have to

1116
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,300
determine do we have the right

1117
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,179
components to actually handle those

1118
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,920
extreme condition swings and have an

1119
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:40,500
operational units because if you don't

1120
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,800
have the right components select it for

1121
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:46,019
such swings you're going to see a drop

1122
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,820
in your performance for the system and

1123
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:49,500
then a drop in environmental control for

1124
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,859
your rooms

1125
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:55,500
so making sure yeah

1126
00:41:51,858 --> 00:41:58,319
that's makes sense I think

1127
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:02,338
we've even seen units just stop working

1128
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:06,180
right when it gets to low low ambient

1129
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:08,820
temperatures and even and very it

1130
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:12,179
performs the suffers terribly at the

1131
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:14,400
high side right yeah 100 and I'm sure

1132
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:16,440
like as a lot of the listeners probably

1133
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,059
know like keeping the right sort of

1134
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,940
pressure and temperatures throughout the

1135
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:24,179
systems is extremely important and that

1136
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:26,220
becomes very suspect to I guess dropping

1137
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:29,098
off during these low ambient and high

1138
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:31,500
ambient conditions and so being able to

1139
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:33,119
kind of predict that and combat that

1140
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:36,239
beforehand when you're doing your unit

1141
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,800
selection is extremely important

1142
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:40,439
sounds good

1143
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,599
all right uh let's see

1144
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,059
got another one here what are some of

1145
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:47,760
the gotchas you've run into coming into

1146
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:51,199
projects early versus late and I think

1147
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,200
I'll direct that one to Adrian

1148
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,820
yeah I tried to try to Pepper a couple

1149
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,379
of them in there throughout

1150
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,579
um you know

1151
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,380
um

1152
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:04,318
there's there's a lot that we run into

1153
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,660
you know it we could we could talk about

1154
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,338
um we could talk about operational and

1155
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:09,838
and maintenance and things like that

1156
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:12,000
throughout the like hey make sure you

1157
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,858
change your filters routinely

1158
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,019
um we find that to be something that

1159
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:18,539
that happens you know that doesn't

1160
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:21,599
happen on a routine basis enough and and

1161
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:23,818
that can really impact your performance

1162
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,800
um we see you know on more on the design

1163
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:27,420
side if if we're sort of looking at it

1164
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,519
from that perspective

1165
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:32,039
um we see scope gaps

1166
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:35,219
um really rampant

1167
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:37,199
um between different uh providers of

1168
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:39,239
systems and

1169
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,539
um I think really effectively maybe not

1170
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:45,179
taking advantage of the

1171
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:46,800
um construction management and general

1172
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:49,618
contractor

1173
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,859
um trades that that exists really for

1174
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:55,500
that reason to to truly try to eliminate

1175
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:56,759
scope gaps on projects as early as

1176
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,260
possible

1177
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,960
um because those professionals are out

1178
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:03,060
there and exist and would do Wonders on

1179
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,099
helping to keep a project on time and on

1180
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:08,219
budget and avoid

1181
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:10,440
um unnecessary really and and very very

1182
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:12,299
costly and challenging change orders

1183
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,760
that end up happening

1184
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,740
um we see many facilities that don't

1185
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,359
have enough power that's that's one

1186
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:21,000
right off the bat

1187
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:22,199
um and it can be you know it depends on

1188
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,639
where you're where you're at some

1189
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:25,439
utilities say great we'll have it for

1190
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:26,759
you in a couple of months others say

1191
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,200
great we'll have it for you in a couple

1192
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,880
of years

1193
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,679
um and you know what what's your

1194
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,599
financial situation like at that

1195
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,098
particular site or building over those

1196
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,539
couple of year period that you're

1197
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:38,099
waiting for the utility to bring you

1198
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:39,779
that power that's one of the other

1199
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:41,119
reasons that we see

1200
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,819
um combined heat and power plant

1201
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:46,680
facilities uh being you know being

1202
00:44:43,818 --> 00:44:48,300
combined heat and power uh systems being

1203
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:50,039
utilized at these types of facilities

1204
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,480
more often because you may have gas

1205
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:54,599
available where you don't have

1206
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,940
electricity and structural limitations

1207
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:58,440
and deficiencies is another huge one I

1208
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,659
mean you know I think we've recently had

1209
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,980
a project you know it was a six million

1210
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:02,879
dollar project and they found out that

1211
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,559
they were going to have to make two

1212
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,599
million dollars of structural upgrades

1213
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:08,039
to be able to make the project work and

1214
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:09,480
they said well so you know that's not

1215
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,980
that's not going to work for us so let's

1216
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,838
let's go find a different different

1217
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,818
building and facility and that all that

1218
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:16,619
money was down the drain up front so

1219
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:18,800
those are just a couple that come to

1220
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,800
mind

1221
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,280
yeah it's great

1222
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:27,659
uh Joe do you have anything else to add

1223
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,000
there any any

1224
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:31,920
yeah

1225
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,420
one that really stood out to me was just

1226
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,940
um you know facilities that kind of

1227
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,740
utilized their overall

1228
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,838
um square footage like their plot square

1229
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:41,338
footage for the building and then

1230
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,318
they're limited on how much clearance

1231
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:45,000
they have for the units like alongside

1232
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:47,279
the building we've seen that kind of

1233
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,940
come up a bit that people sometimes

1234
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,140
overlook

1235
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:55,260
[Music]

1236
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:59,159
yeah I'd also add issues lots of issues

1237
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:02,040
around sizing the HVAC systems as well

1238
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:05,219
around the latent and sensible the

1239
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:08,159
reheat the supplemental heat whether or

1240
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:10,259
not to use humidification at early stage

1241
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:13,739
flower right there's a there's a

1242
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:15,900
transition from Veg to flour where

1243
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:18,479
the humidity conditions change and you

1244
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,519
can shock the plants or you can or in

1245
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,099
early stage flower you don't have enough

1246
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:26,219
humidity coming off of the plants enough

1247
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:30,359
evaporation coming off of the plants to

1248
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:32,578
um give the units sufficient load so you

1249
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:35,519
I think Adrian and judge you guys could

1250
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:37,859
talk more specific about this but

1251
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,139
um being able to just just accommodating

1252
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:42,900
the life cycle of the plants and going

1253
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:44,400
from room to room there are lots of

1254
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,539
considerations that need to be made as

1255
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,760
well

1256
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:49,800
yeah yeah high level you just you need

1257
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,020
to be able to provision for humidifiers

1258
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,839
in your flowering spaces in order in

1259
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:56,940
order to do that VPD match from from Veg

1260
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:59,039
over to flower

1261
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,019
um and another one that I I neglected to

1262
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:02,460
mention I just just thought of was

1263
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:04,259
um the importance of tight room

1264
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,179
construction right everything that we've

1265
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,640
talked about here about environmental

1266
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:10,259
control can only be done if you have

1267
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,379
tight room construction and we're not

1268
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:15,240
losing air into external environments

1269
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:17,640
either through the you know the

1270
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:19,979
construction of the room itself or

1271
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:21,838
through the ductwork you know joining

1272
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,980
the air handling unit systems to the to

1273
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:24,980
the room itself

1274
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:31,019
that's a good point I think yeah the

1275
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,420
Assumption with all all of this is that

1276
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:35,400
you've got good construction and if

1277
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:38,940
you've got infiltrations and

1278
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:42,300
exfiltrations of heat or moisture or CO2

1279
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:44,400
or whatever else then the performance of

1280
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,300
your room and your facility is going to

1281
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,780
suffer

1282
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,780
you know

1283
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,980
okay uh let's see another one here uh

1284
00:47:51,659 --> 00:47:55,379
related to the conventional

1285
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:57,659
non-integrated stuff is it possible to

1286
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:00,838
get good control of the environment with

1287
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:02,940
many splits and dehumidifiers uh JoJo

1288
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:04,318
why don't I toss that one to you yeah

1289
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:07,380
man that's actually a great question

1290
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:09,539
especially you know where the current

1291
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,460
space and how a lot of our current

1292
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:13,259
facilities are set up you know alone

1293
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,000
these units can definitely provide

1294
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,700
moderate control to their local

1295
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,679
environments and why not say local I

1296
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:21,719
mean the square footage that you usually

1297
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,879
see on these specification sheets you

1298
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:26,039
know they kind of think of you can kind

1299
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,838
of think of it like a hemisphere each

1300
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:30,239
individual Standalone or mini split is

1301
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:33,119
controlling their own hemisphere rather

1302
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:35,219
than controlling the room as a whole so

1303
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:38,039
inherently that's where I guess the lack

1304
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:40,379
of performance comes from is they're not

1305
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:43,500
truly integrated and they're controlling

1306
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:45,660
for their own local environments whereas

1307
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,460
Integrated Systems they see the unit I

1308
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:51,420
mean the room as a whole and are

1309
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:53,400
controlling accordingly to that now

1310
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,680
you know one thing that I want to say is

1311
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:58,139
a lot of our our customers or customers

1312
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:00,000
in the space that have this system

1313
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:01,318
already in place of an sa system I'm

1314
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,019
talking about like Mini Splits and

1315
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:06,480
dehumidifiers there is possibility to

1316
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:09,420
get that integrated control

1317
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,539
after the fact with a controls retrofit

1318
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:15,059
with a more plant-centric sequence of

1319
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:17,818
operation to integrate all those

1320
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:19,679
individual units as one so you're kind

1321
00:49:17,818 --> 00:49:21,358
of making that you know a bunch of

1322
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:23,699
little random um split systems

1323
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:26,159
dehumidifiers and integrating them into

1324
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:28,919
one whole package now it's not as great

1325
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:31,019
as a truly integrated package system or

1326
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:34,200
a hydronic system would be but it's

1327
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:35,699
definitely that next step up between

1328
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:39,838
the two

1329
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:41,460
I hope I answer that to you guys

1330
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:43,139
yeah yeah I think that was that was

1331
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,639
great and there's a there's a comment or

1332
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:46,139
a question in the chat I think that is

1333
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:48,179
it's somewhat maybe somewhat

1334
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:51,000
tangentially related to this that it

1335
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:52,858
might be good to to to address

1336
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,838
um which is how long does the humidity

1337
00:49:52,858 --> 00:49:57,179
Spike last in that non-integrated system

1338
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:58,679
and where all the other parameters held

1339
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:00,899
constant between the integrated system

1340
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:02,338
such that the difference in yield can be

1341
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,119
attributed

1342
00:50:02,338 --> 00:50:05,159
um

1343
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,579
I mean first off

1344
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:10,199
um well so the the short answer is yes

1345
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:13,619
we did everything that we possibly could

1346
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:16,379
to make those two rooms side by side as

1347
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:17,880
um as you know really keep that as the

1348
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,039
only control variable

1349
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,660
um between them inherently there there

1350
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:23,940
may be some other

1351
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:25,980
um noise in that no doubt

1352
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:28,559
um there there's so many differences

1353
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:30,780
that go on even even on a p on a plan

1354
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,759
when you design a facility with eight

1355
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,680
identical flower rooms and then you go

1356
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,180
and you build that facility and you

1357
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:37,919
think that you've built them all

1358
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:40,318
identically

1359
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,599
um you'll end up with with some small

1360
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:44,699
changes and and differences between all

1361
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:46,440
those rooms too so it's very first off

1362
00:50:44,699 --> 00:50:47,519
just it's very challenging to do that in

1363
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,159
general

1364
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:52,139
um but um the other piece of it is we

1365
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:55,318
would love to do more science truly

1366
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:58,618
scientific research and um have the

1367
00:50:55,318 --> 00:51:01,139
ability to be very very certain about

1368
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:03,059
these types of types of situations

1369
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:05,219
um unfortunately there's not much money

1370
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:07,859
and propensity for it in the Cannabis

1371
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:10,019
space presently based on the illegality

1372
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:13,440
of it federally and how the funding

1373
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:15,539
sources for universities work that have

1374
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,579
that have controlled environment

1375
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:19,679
Agriculture and indoor plant environment

1376
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:21,420
type programs we were at a conference

1377
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:24,179
last week where there's a lot of these

1378
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:26,099
folks speaking and presenting research

1379
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:28,739
and things and it is starting to loosen

1380
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:30,780
up little by little and and hopefully

1381
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:33,419
we're going to make good progress here

1382
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:35,280
over the next year or two in that in the

1383
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:38,818
hopes of really being able to do true

1384
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,260
testing one side one to the other

1385
00:51:38,818 --> 00:51:42,659
um but in specific to the to the first

1386
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:47,700
part of that question that humidity

1387
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:49,618
Spike lasts for about an hour typically

1388
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:52,379
um it can be you know one to two hours

1389
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:53,338
is is what we normally see in those

1390
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,200
situations

1391
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:57,179
um and we can we can definitely answer

1392
00:51:55,199 --> 00:52:00,919
more detailed questions on that uh

1393
00:51:57,179 --> 00:52:00,919
further offline if you like

1394
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:06,719
yeah lots of structural challenges with

1395
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:10,139
growing cannabis particularly on the

1396
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:12,480
federal level 20 total States now have

1397
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:15,719
legalized recreational

1398
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,400
adult use for above 21 and I you know

1399
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:20,159
what we're definitely at the critical

1400
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,838
mass in in this country and you can see

1401
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:25,139
it really internationally as well so I

1402
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:28,739
hope that that really starts to to uh

1403
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:32,480
um to open up money for uh for more uh

1404
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:32,479
more more research and development

1405
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:37,980
foreign

1406
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:39,719
for now we uh we're all doing as much as

1407
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:41,300
we possibly can

1408
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:44,159
yeah

1409
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:46,440
so there's another good one you want me

1410
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,058
to take this one in the chat I think is

1411
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,980
good um do you run into building

1412
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:51,119
department jurisdictions that push for

1413
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,818
providing

1414
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,858
um outside air as part of in this case

1415
00:52:53,818 --> 00:52:58,139
Title 24 which is a California energy

1416
00:52:55,858 --> 00:52:59,818
code requirement or they typically treat

1417
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:02,098
the rooms as processed rooms and allow

1418
00:52:59,818 --> 00:53:03,838
for the 100 recirculation

1419
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:05,880
um so this actually is going to be

1420
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:06,558
specifically

1421
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,880
um

1422
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:11,040
specifically addressed in the code

1423
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,800
change that's coming in less than two

1424
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:15,119
months in January 2023

1425
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,280
um the

1426
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,019
um

1427
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,300
cea in general indoor plant environments

1428
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:24,480
will become a covered process under

1429
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:26,160
California Title 24 energy code which I

1430
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,199
think is will be the first time in the

1431
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:30,358
across the country that this process

1432
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:31,318
load will actually be required to be

1433
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:35,279
covered

1434
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:38,099
um in the energy code and previously up

1435
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:41,339
until now we've just been calling it a

1436
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:44,519
process room and having an exemption for

1437
00:53:41,338 --> 00:53:47,338
the economizers uh from the current code

1438
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:49,440
but with this becoming a covered process

1439
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:51,719
there are some other stipulations that

1440
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,599
you need to meet around

1441
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:59,759
um reusing and or utilizing

1442
00:53:54,599 --> 00:54:01,559
um uh waste heat and basically trying to

1443
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,740
minimize the amount of reheat energy

1444
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:05,400
that's used of new energy

1445
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:08,759
um

1446
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,019
and as a result of it becoming a covered

1447
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,300
process they're now they're

1448
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:14,759
understanding this sort of you know

1449
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,500
Nuance that goes against the code the

1450
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,839
way California's code is set up and so

1451
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:22,800
there there is an exemption for

1452
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:24,838
economizers written in to this new code

1453
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,559
language to allow you to not have to

1454
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:27,558
worry about it anymore

1455
00:54:29,338 --> 00:54:34,318
yeah just to um kind of add to that age

1456
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:37,440
the heat requirement or the reheat

1457
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:40,079
requirement is 75 of your annual annual

1458
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:43,280
usage should come from on-site he

1459
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,280
recovered methods

1460
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:49,200
yeah yeah and and the comment from Jason

1461
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:51,480
is is is is great because you know

1462
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:53,338
there's there's there's other potential

1463
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,019
reasons to use outside air in

1464
00:54:53,338 --> 00:54:56,639
cultivation spaces

1465
00:54:55,019 --> 00:54:58,440
um which in his his comment was that you

1466
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:00,239
need you can use some outside air to

1467
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,980
purge ethylene which is a gaseous

1468
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:03,899
hormone which accumulates in sealed

1469
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,980
plant environment so that's another

1470
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:09,300
place where we'd love to see more

1471
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:11,338
research and development

1472
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,559
um to really help inform the way that

1473
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:15,000
these systems are are constructed we

1474
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:17,519
have the ability to bring an outside air

1475
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,440
and we treat all that air so it's really

1476
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:21,420
just more about you know when should we

1477
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,920
do it why should we do it how often

1478
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,920
should we do it that sort of a thing

1479
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:29,280
thank you

1480
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:31,318
that's great hopefully that helped

1481
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,800
answer some of those questions

1482
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:38,579
um we're we're up uh on the hour right

1483
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,960
now our Resource page uh is a page on

1484
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:43,260
our website that we're really proud of

1485
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:45,720
we've dropped a lot of a lot a lot of

1486
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:49,740
information on what we've learned over

1487
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:51,899
the last five to six years and uh lots

1488
00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:54,779
of good resources there to to brush up

1489
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:57,960
on both plant related and Engineering

1490
00:55:54,780 --> 00:56:00,119
related material as it relates to cea

1491
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,858
which by the way stands for controlled

1492
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:02,760
environment agriculture if anybody was

1493
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:05,460
wondering

1494
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:09,359
I think maybe we should cap it off right

1495
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:10,858
now but if anybody has any follow-up

1496
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:13,019
questions please feel free to get in

1497
00:56:10,858 --> 00:56:15,480
touch with us we're available anytime

1498
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:17,280
always love to talk and really
