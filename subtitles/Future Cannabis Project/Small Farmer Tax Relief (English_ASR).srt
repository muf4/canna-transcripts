2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,859
nobody thought that they wiped that

3
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:19,199
conventional market out so quick and and

4
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,149
nobody thought that you know they'd wipe

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,489
out the small farmers on the legal side

6
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:24,929
to sow the effects of it it's like we

7
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:27,149
beat it to death and then people feel

8
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,469
the effects but I guess that what you're

9
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:30,149
saying is yeah what do we do about are

10
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:31,589
you talking about what's the action plan

11
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:32,820
from there I've talked about a subsidy

12
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,289
for a lot of these small farmers or

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,730
they've been there for 30 years or

14
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,899
something I mean they should just come

15
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:38,009
up with billions of dollars and give

16
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,838
them a couple hundred thousand and a

17
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:41,219
piece or something because that's it's a

18
00:00:39,838 --> 00:00:42,509
two-fold effect cuz you know most of

19
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,429
they've lost a lot of the value in their

20
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,808
real estate because because the farms

21
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:47,039
aren't worth as much you've seen

22
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:48,750
depreciation especially in those

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,910
outlying areas like Bell Springs spy

24
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,280
Rock Island Mountain and everything else

25
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:55,288
it's really been heartbreaking so what

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,899
do you think the action plan is I mean I

27
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,600
think I think tax relief especially for

28
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,030
the small farmer would go a long way you

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,570
know there's just the inability for the

30
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,359
small farmer to compete price-wise

31
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:11,279
against you know corporate cannabis

32
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,289
that's coming in and growing you know

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,040
tens or hundreds of thousands of square

34
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:20,519
feet of yeah of canopy you know if there

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,960
was some relief there for the small

36
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,089
farmer on the tax side of things they

37
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,548
could actually compete with that market

38
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,439
a lot better I mean like - how to just

39
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,600
complete you know well I mean I was

40
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,669
really sad to see you know there was

41
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,059
movement to have the cultivation tax

42
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,859
canceled essentially for multiple years

43
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,228
and then reinstituted in a more

44
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,118
responsible way down the road that bill

45
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:44,099
didn't make it through and I feel like

46
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,129
in a lot of ways that was kind of the

47
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:50,099
knife or the dagger into in the heart

48
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:52,289
for the small farmer is to you know not

49
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,599
pass that through the legislation I was

50
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,530
like a thousand cuts like Swami says cuz

51
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,000
they're different ways they've just

52
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,430
chopped us you know one piece at a time

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,629
but definitely that's their and I don't

54
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,100
know how like you said I agree

55
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,078
completely small farmer can't compete

56
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,129
against have one big company's got 500

57
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,449
acres you see the stuff that they're

58
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:09,199
getting right now it's just amazing the

59
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,199
size of scope

60
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,870
you
