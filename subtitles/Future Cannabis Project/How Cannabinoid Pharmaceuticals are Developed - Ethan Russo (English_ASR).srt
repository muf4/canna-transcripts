2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,240
hey everybody this is jason wilson with

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,480
the curious about cannabis podcast

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,759
thanks so much for tuning in once again

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,638
today i'm joined by somebody i've been

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,278
wanting to talk to

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,719
for quite a while dr ethan rousseau uh

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,559
thank you ethan for being willing to

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,759
take the time to sit down with me today

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,439
thank you

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,720
yeah so um and i

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,320
i almost struggle to

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,839
figure out how to introduce you because

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,238
there's so many different angles i could

15
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,679
take

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:38,799
you were um involved at one point in

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,679
um getting side effects going and

18
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,359
approved is that right

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,719
sure yeah for 11 years i worked for gw

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:49,439
pharmaceuticals

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:52,558
as senior medical advisor and uh

22
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,599
medical monitor study physician in

23
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:58,238
development of sativex and epidialex

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,679
yeah and then you also on the side are

25
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,038
involved in a lot of

26
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,640
um different types of broader research

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,040
and education

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,920
sure i've been involved in cannabis and

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,479
cannabinoid research for 23 years

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,320
yeah quite a quite a record and some of

31
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:14,719
the some of the review papers that

32
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,839
you've

33
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,359
written um have been critical tools in

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,759
the education work that i do

35
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,040
like taming thc is now pretty much a

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,519
classic

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,000
and there was a recent one you did to

38
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:31,359
the no strain no gain

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,840
review paper about you know

40
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,359
the the complex you know what we call

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,320
the entourage effects some people call

42
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,438
matrix effects

43
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,039
you know whatever but um

44
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,519
in my opinion you've done some really

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,439
good work summarizing relatively complex

46
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,039
ideas that are digestible to a broader

47
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,438
audience well i hope so

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,720
one of the big issues right now is

49
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,000
trying to sort out

50
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:56,319
whether uh people should have single

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
compounds like single cannabinoids

52
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,519
versus

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,040
whole plant extracts and i'm clearly in

54
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,158
the latter camp

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,560
yeah for the synergy the boosting effect

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,080
that

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,759
uh these provide over and above the

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,800
kinds of effects that we can get with

59
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,799
single compounds

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,439
yeah a lot of doctors and nurses that

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,520
i've spoken to

62
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,439
that are doing clinical work with

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,840
cannabis products in the united states

64
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,959
a lot of them um it's been a pretty

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,759
consistent message

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,199
that they've said at this point they

67
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,399
tend to only want to work

68
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,238
with what they term broader spectrum

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,640
extracts of cannabis usually like

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,080
ethanol sourced

71
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,079
that maintain a wide diversity of

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,120
phytochemistry and what they tell me

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
and what i mentioned to talk to you

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,159
about is what research data we have to

75
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:51,679
to kind of support it but um

76
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:54,318
they're able to get better outcomes

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,040
at lower dosages with fewer side effects

78
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,280
sure

79
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,199
well we can illustrate this by going

80
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,318
back a little bit historically

81
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:06,479
in 1985 synthetic thc as marinol was

82
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,119
approved by the fda

83
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,919
the thought among certain people at the

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,280
time was

85
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,679
this would obviate the need for

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,719
cannabis treatment for medical

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,080
conditions

88
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:23,439
instead what we got was a drug that

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,480
is very poorly tolerated

90
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,318
and gained no traction in the

91
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:32,079
marketplace

92
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:35,199
thc by itself is a very disorienting

93
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,239
drug people tend to be dysphoric

94
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,399
unhappy rather than euphoric

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,599
even people who are accustomed to

96
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,120
cannabis

97
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:47,919
find thc in pure form

98
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,519
a very difficult drug to tolerate and

99
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,238
very few people

100
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,239
remain on it for any length of time and

101
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,280
when people have had the opportunity to

102
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,719
compare almost invariably they prefer

103
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,120
herbal forms of cannabis yeah that's

104
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,120
um that's been my experience too i have

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,759
a good friend of mine that

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,759
funny enough to treat schizophrenia got

107
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,798
approved for marinol

108
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:16,238
which is sort of strange

109
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,519
in one in one sense to me but um

110
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,839
he uh reported similarly that he

111
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,240
had some success with herbal cannabis

112
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,560
controlling certain uh positive symptoms

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,560
right that he was dealing with and um

114
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,399
the marinol just didn't do

115
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,918
anything that the herbal canvas did

116
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,198
other than making him feel uncomfortable

117
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,639
like physically

118
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,080
um unsettled as is what he reported and

119
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,879
that's the only person that i personally

120
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,839
know that has

121
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,719
been on a marinol prescription sure uh

122
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,519
beyond that

123
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,120
we have now a lot of evidence both

124
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,639
laboratory and clinical

125
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,600
that uh much better results accrue

126
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,639
when we're dealing with complex mixtures

127
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
from

128
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,879
cannabis extracts as opposed to pure

129
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,918
compounds

130
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:05,918
a recent illustration was saw

131
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:07,279
a an article from spain blasco benitez

132
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,439
at all

133
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,399
in which they were looking effects at

134
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,038
effects

135
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,319
on cancer both in cell culture and in

136
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:18,000
animals

137
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,360
comparing pure thc with which worked to

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,560
some extent

139
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,960
on treating the cancers but in

140
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,280
comparison to a cannabis extract there

141
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,000
was

142
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,038
much much greater activity with very

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,759
salient

144
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,038
statistically significant differences

145
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,080
right yeah

146
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:41,519
i i remember there was some paper i read

147
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:44,560
that was looking at was it

148
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,680
tnf alpha levels in mice

149
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,918
that was looking at

150
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,600
i don't remember the actual type of

151
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:52,000
botanical extract that they used from

152
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,199
cannabis

153
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,360
but they were trying to compare to

154
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,360
isolate and look at dose response curves

155
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,038
sure essentially yeah another good

156
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,919
example um

157
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,918
was there was a paper by pamplona in

158
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,918
2018

159
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:10,959
that compared pure cbd

160
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:14,159
uh as would be an epidiolex

161
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:18,478
to the results that people got with

162
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,600
uh cbd predominant cannabis extracts

163
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:24,959
what they found was equal efficacy but

164
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,840
with the uh cannabis extracts the doses

165
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,959
were about

166
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:32,318
in on average 22

167
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:36,799
of what was required with pure cbd

168
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,840
so instead of 1500 milligrams a day

169
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,038
perhaps 300 milligrams saw would be

170
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,079
enough

171
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:48,159
of the corresponding extract

172
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:51,918
so this can represent a substantial

173
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,400
savings and cost additionally with the

174
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:57,279
high doses of pure cbd

175
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,478
there is the possibility of drug drug

176
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,559
interaction

177
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,560
particularly sedation with some of the

178
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,160
drugs that are used in epilepsy

179
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,079
treatment

180
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,280
yeah and i know there's some concern

181
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,439
lately too

182
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,638
and there's controversy of controversy

183
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,839
over some of it but about the liver

184
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,038
toxicity of

185
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,959
high doses of cbd as well well i

186
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:19,120
i think that's a blind ally to be

187
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,159
truthful obviously

188
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,598
lower dose would be better but um

189
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,240
the liver issues are mainly related to

190
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:28,839
elevations of liver function tests and

191
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,160
this is

192
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:35,119
in uh generally children uh

193
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,759
who are in polypharmacy with a number of

194
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,399
drugs

195
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,720
particularly of valporic acid which is

196
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,478
well known for being a bad actor in

197
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,000
terms of

198
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:48,878
lft elevation um so

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,918
my strong suspicion is that's related to

200
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,400
polypharmacy

201
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,279
multiple drugs rather than a specific

202
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,318
effect

203
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,519
of cannabidiol yeah that's a that's an

204
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,160
extremely

205
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:04,478
good point to make um that the

206
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,199
the risks contraindications and

207
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:07,120
everything are

208
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,598
very different circumstance circumstance

209
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,680
depending on what a patient is

210
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,719
is taking and i would assume not just

211
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,560
the

212
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,080
other medicines they're taking but even

213
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,800
possibly their diets i know there are

214
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,800
different

215
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,400
dietary elements that can influence yeah

216
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,520
i would just add the point that i've

217
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,478
seen a lot of people

218
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,680
conflate even in presentations at

219
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,120
conferences

220
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,918
conflate the side effect profile of pure

221
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,278
cbd

222
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:36,478
at high dosage to cbd in general and

223
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:40,719
that's not a fair comparison um

224
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,759
i would say that cannabidiol

225
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,080
despite its many complex

226
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,679
mechanisms of action as an extremely

227
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:54,720
safe drug with very few adverse events

228
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:56,479
yeah and what uh

229
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,000
i mean there's a tidal wave of research

230
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,399
kind of coming out now

231
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,759
now that um i mean especially now that

232
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,320
the farm bill's passed there are a lot

233
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:07,360
of universities now ramping up to study

234
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,640
cbd and hemp extracts and

235
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,159
um and and in general with legalization

236
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,319
movements happening across

237
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,838
the world there are more researchers

238
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,080
feeling more comfortable

239
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,000
taking on this work but in your opinion

240
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,080
where does the research particularly

241
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,620
around cbd and cbd extracts

242
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,278
need to go um i guess to

243
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,000
[Music]

244
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,519
elucidate some of those nuances that can

245
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,399
help

246
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,519
particularly physicians understand uh

247
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,559
what they're dealing with and if they

248
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,600
have patients that are coming them

249
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,278
telling them they're using

250
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,759
different types of cbd products yeah

251
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,720
well first and foremost as an

252
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:49,360
issue of the preparation right now it's

253
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,120
sort of the wild west out there

254
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,320
with online cannabidiol products

255
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,919
i can't vouch for the utility or safety

256
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,399
of any preparation

257
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,519
without a certificate of analysis and i

258
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,600
want to know

259
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,560
exactly what's in it not just the

260
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,040
cannabidiol

261
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,919
content but other cannabinoids the

262
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,159
terpene terpenoid content

263
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,919
i want to see evidence that it's safe

264
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:17,679
that there's no pesticide residue

265
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:18,078
microbiological contamination or heavy

266
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,039
metal

267
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,078
contamination and beyond that i just

268
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,719
won't comment

269
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,679
and i would urge consumers to be

270
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,160
extremely

271
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,679
diligent in trying to require that

272
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,559
information

273
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,639
my bias is that that information should

274
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,159
be available for every product

275
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,480
rather than whether medical or

276
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,159
recreational at point of sale

277
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,600
so that's first and foremost beyond that

278
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:48,799
um it really is a matter of what's in it

279
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,278
so we can have cannabidiol but

280
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,159
there's almost nothing that cannabidiol

281
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,879
does

282
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,679
that will not be enhanced by having at

283
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,200
least

284
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:02,239
a tiny amount of thc on board at all

285
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,278
really synergizes uh these

286
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,240
normally occur together in the plant

287
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,919
uh it sounds corny but that's the way

288
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,240
nature intended it

289
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,759
and that's what usually works best

290
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,440
medically

291
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:20,639
the effects of a given preparation are

292
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,120
going to depend on those components and

293
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,439
we really can fine-tune things in terms

294
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,560
of applicability

295
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,959
to produce synergies towards

296
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,838
treatment of specific disorders what i

297
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:37,039
mean is for example

298
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,560
if we want to treat a mood disorder such

299
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,879
as anxiety

300
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,000
we can look for possible synergy between

301
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,439
cannabidiol which

302
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
has a proven effect at a certain dosage

303
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,279
plus an additional component such as

304
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,278
linoleul

305
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:56,639
which is a common component

306
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,159
terpenoid that's also in lavender for

307
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,120
example and it's well known

308
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:03,120
traditionally

309
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,078
as something that produces a calming

310
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,159
anti-anxiety effect so that's just one

311
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:11,599
illustration

312
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,759
you know what i'd like to see is that uh

313
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,040
there's a greater appreciation of these

314
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,000
nuances

315
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,399
uh of how cannabis can be tuned to the

316
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,958
individual need

317
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,440
yeah and something i'm interested in too

318
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,719
that

319
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
segues into another thing i wanted to

320
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,519
talk to you about which is the

321
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,000
endocannabinoid system is

322
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,919
um i'm interested to see research that

323
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
goes into how to

324
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,759
characterize the endocannabinoid system

325
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,480
tone more i think that's really

326
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,319
fascinating sure

327
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,759
well it's a tough one yeah first let's

328
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,240
define some terms

329
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,439
yeah uh the endocannabinoid system is

330
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,320
the master

331
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,440
homeostatic regulator of physiology what

332
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,519
does that mean

333
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,839
well physiology is how things work in

334
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,879
the body

335
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:57,600
on generally you need a certain level of

336
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,000
activity neither too high nor too low

337
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,519
and that's precisely what the

338
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,639
endocannabinoid system does is try and

339
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,000
keep things

340
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,879
in happy balance so if a system is

341
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,200
overactive it tends to bring it down if

342
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,480
it's

343
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,278
under active to bring it up this works

344
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,399
through

345
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:19,480
complex mechanisms we have

346
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,278
endogenous chemicals within called

347
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,560
endocannabinoids

348
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:28,000
specifically two arachidoglycerol

349
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:30,078
2a g for short and anandamide

350
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
anandamide in particular closely

351
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:35,439
resembles thc

352
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,320
both are partial agonists at

353
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,240
the cb1 receptor the mean psychoactive

354
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,560
receptor in the brain and elsewhere

355
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,399
throughout the body

356
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:49,479
and what this does at the brain level

357
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,039
is actually reduce the release of

358
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,159
neurotransmitters

359
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:57,360
so if we have a glutamate

360
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,799
neuron that's stimulatory

361
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
the reduction in the release of

362
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,439
glutamate will lower that

363
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,799
activity good example of why that's

364
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,639
important is

365
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:11,039
we'll give two glutamate

366
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,320
activity tends to be excessive in

367
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:16,159
neuropathic pain

368
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,399
nerve-based pain so if we have a person

369
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:22,159
with chronic neuropathic pain

370
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,639
on we can either raise their anamide

371
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,159
level

372
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:29,600
or supply exogenous thc

373
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:32,480
and bring that glutamate level down and

374
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,440
that's going to help with pain similarly

375
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,480
in

376
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,519
brain injury whether it be trauma

377
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,920
stroke or things of that sort we get an

378
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,440
excessive release of glutamate

379
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,399
it can be so bad there can be so much

380
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,440
glutamate

381
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,839
that it produces an excitotoxicity

382
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,560
that the cells actually stimulate

383
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,560
themselves to death

384
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,799
we have situations in which people

385
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,198
suffer a head injury

386
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:04,319
they might seem okay briefly and then

387
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:07,000
rapidly deteriorate over 48 hours

388
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,440
and some of that effect is from this

389
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
excitotoxicity from glutamate

390
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,320
if we're able to supply drugs like

391
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,039
cannabidiol or thc

392
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,920
early enough some of that can be

393
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:22,480
prevented

394
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:26,120
and have a much better result clinically

395
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,199
so those would be examples going back to

396
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,799
endocannabinoid tone

397
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:32,799
endocannabinoid tone is an important

398
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,958
concept but we don't have good ways of

399
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:38,240
measuring it right

400
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:41,679
the three important aspects are how much

401
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,680
of the endocannabinoids are present

402
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,198
second is what's the activity of the

403
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,799
receptors

404
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:50,399
if someone is using thc at high doses

405
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,879
recreationally

406
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,519
the receptor number will actually go

407
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,480
down

408
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,679
it's the brain and body's way of trying

409
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,959
to keep things

410
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:03,838
on an even keel so the receptors become

411
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,278
inactive when they stop they'll

412
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,399
reactivate

413
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,838
um so there is the number and status of

414
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,759
the receptors

415
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,800
there is the amount of the

416
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,919
endocannabinoids and the third

417
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,359
part is what is the activity of the

418
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,439
enzymes that make

419
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:27,120
the endocannabinoids and break them down

420
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,120
so unfortunately we don't have ways of

421
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,078
measuring this directly

422
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,720
except with invasive techniques such as

423
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,958
doing a lumbar puncture or spinal tap to

424
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,079
measure anandamide levels but that's

425
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,758
invasive

426
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:42,000
it's not something you can do on

427
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:46,240
experimental basis

428
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,639
with most ethics committees for example

429
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
ideally in the future we would have

430
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,600
scans

431
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,839
non-invasive methods of trying to assess

432
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,480
endocannabinoid tone but that's a

433
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,920
dream for the future right now right

434
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,519
yeah and

435
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,519
measuring the endocannabinoids isn't it

436
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,519
a little complicated too because they're

437
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,120
produced on demand it's not like they're

438
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,720
stored in vesicles like

439
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,639
a lot of neurotransmitters are yeah

440
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,798
that's exactly right so

441
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,319
these are in a constant state of flux

442
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,359
they're just not there

443
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,000
for any period of time similarly they're

444
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,759
very hard

445
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,838
thing to study um anandamite is rapidly

446
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:27,119
broken down in the

447
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:29,519
the bloodstream um so when we are

448
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,479
looking at serum levels which may or may

449
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,960
not reflect what's going on in the brain

450
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,120
the samples often have to be frozen and

451
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,360
liquid nitrogen

452
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,599
and then be transported to a specialty

453
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,519
lab this is not something where you can

454
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,918
go into your local hospital and get your

455
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,319
blood drawn and see what your status is

456
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,480
right

457
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,159
uh we're talking some very sophisticated

458
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,400
science here

459
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,759
yeah and another thing that

460
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,120
comes to mind when i think about the

461
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,279
complexities of trying to measure the

462
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,519
endocannabinoid system tone is that

463
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,720
the endocannabinoid system is not just

464
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,720
cb1 receptors and cb2 receptors it's

465
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,930
it's a really complicated system that

466
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,240
overlaps with a lot of other

467
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,279
[Music]

468
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,798
physiological systems and other

469
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,359
different types of receptors that would

470
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:19,599
normally

471
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,798
be associated with other other systems

472
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,719
in the body right

473
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:27,440
well yeah no it's a broadening concept

474
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,798
i asked my friend and colleague vincenzo

475
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,600
de marzo

476
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,720
whether he now would consider the

477
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,599
serotonin one e receptor part of the

478
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,720
endocannabinoid system

479
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:42,798
and his he didn't hesitate he said yes

480
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:46,160
how this comes into play is cannabidiol

481
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:48,279
was shown by my team

482
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,558
at the university of montana back in

483
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:53,678
2005.

484
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:57,038
cannabidiol is a serotonin 1a

485
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,840
agonist and we're finding that that

486
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,879
mechanism explains a lot of activity of

487
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:04,639
cannabidiol

488
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,840
as well as its effect on nausea

489
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,640
prevention of brain damage from

490
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,720
ammonia levels in hepatic failure and a

491
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,440
lot of other mechanisms

492
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,038
another example would be cannabidiol is

493
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,558
also an agonist

494
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:23,679
a stimulant on the trip v1 receptor

495
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,240
the same place where capsaicin works and

496
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,640
again

497
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,079
most experts consider that part of the

498
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,000
broad concept

499
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:34,240
of the endocannabinoid system so

500
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
what's amazing to me at this point is

501
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,599
for a system that's so

502
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,960
fundamental to how our bodies work

503
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,599
this is not in general taught in medical

504
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,798
school

505
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,719
yeah uh you know somebody can go through

506
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:49,759
medical school and learn nothing about

507
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,960
cannabis or

508
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,400
accept perhaps it's a alleged addiction

509
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,600
potential

510
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,519
but unfortunately it's highly likely

511
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,158
they won't learn anything about

512
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,400
the endocannabinoid system despite the

513
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,679
fact that cb1 is the most abundant

514
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,960
g-protein-coupled receptor in the brain

515
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,280
exceeding

516
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,240
uh the number of all the

517
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:16,960
neurotransmitter receptors put together

518
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,440
uh so obviously it's really fundamental

519
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,480
to how

520
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,519
humans work yeah it's it's

521
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,880
um ignoring that system is like having

522
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,200
severe tunnel vision

523
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,559
when trying to think about physiology

524
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,480
considering how

525
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:31,918
how big of a role it is and when i've

526
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,720
talked to

527
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,480
um other doctors that are not because

528
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,519
i'm originally from mississippi so

529
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,279
very conservative um and

530
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,639
much much uh more of a deficit of

531
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,639
understanding than you know you would

532
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,000
find out here on the west coast and

533
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,679
when i've talked to doctors about it

534
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
i've tried to use terms that they might

535
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,960
that might help them put that into

536
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,519
perspective talk about icosinoids

537
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,200
and g protein coupled receptors without

538
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,599
getting into some of the

539
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,519
vocabulary that we have and they they

540
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,399
can start to wrap their mind around that

541
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,400
and around

542
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,759
how the body processes fatty acids and

543
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
how important those are for signaling

544
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,720
and everything but it

545
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,400
it's true and i haven't talked to

546
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,000
anybody that's close to it recently

547
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,200
about whether that's still the case if

548
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,759
medical schools are still

549
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,960
ignoring um you know whether

550
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,759
intentionally or not

551
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,840
um a lot of information about the ecs

552
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:25,359
yeah i'm afraid that's still the case

553
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:27,439
um yeah there's a quite a deficit there

554
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:31,119
that i'd like to see rectified

555
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,600
um it is myopic uh

556
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,879
it's intellectually dishonest and i

557
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:39,038
wonder how much of it is

558
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,320
born from prejudices against uh cannabis

559
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:44,879
yeah yeah and the

560
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,839
you know i know part of it coming from

561
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,960
where i come from

562
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:52,240
there's just so much still taboo around

563
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,200
the idea of cannabis and a lot of um

564
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,359
feeling that you're putting your

565
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,798
professional reputation on the line

566
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:01,918
in order to talk about it in a

567
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,558
in a serious way um that's

568
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,280
one advantage of age i no longer care

569
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,639
about that

570
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:10,879
yeah yeah what are uh

571
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,159
so i've got two things that came to mind

572
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,159
when we were talking about that

573
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,000
one is i wanted to come back around to

574
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,200
the serotonin receptor concept because

575
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,640
it's been shown that

576
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,759
um some serotonin receptors and maybe

577
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,200
it's it's the one you mentioned because

578
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,839
sometimes i get them confused but

579
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,360
they're often

580
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:29,678
heteromers with cb1 receptors they often

581
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,119
appear side by side at times and

582
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,400
influence each other

583
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:36,719
uh yeah that that has been noted in a

584
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,840
number of experiments and to be honest

585
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,480
i don't always know what the

586
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:44,319
ramifications of that

587
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:48,079
are yeah yeah um but um

588
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:51,200
it's always tough uh for me i'm 67

589
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:54,480
so you know my basic uh science

590
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,679
training was like 45 years ago and

591
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,559
things change radically yeah so

592
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,159
you know i i'm like a lot of people and

593
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,319
[Music]

594
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,000
when i've got a new journal article i

595
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,200
think has

596
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,759
pertinence to what i'm investigating i

597
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,880
may need to read it three times to try

598
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,960
and get it straight

599
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:20,159
so none of this stuff is simple

600
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,038
there's a problem trying to translate

601
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:26,280
this into late terms because

602
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:29,440
the foundation is so broad uh in the

603
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:33,038
endocannabinoid system and the details

604
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,798
uh can be so extensive

605
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:40,000
it really defies simple explanations and

606
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:42,158
to be fair that makes it very tough for

607
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,119
the average physician to be able to grab

608
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,520
a hold of this

609
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,439
when their schedule has them seeing a

610
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:51,038
patient every 15 minutes

611
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,200
it's just not amenable to providing

612
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:56,480
a good education to the patient about

613
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,759
anything let alone something so complex

614
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,400
as medical treatment with cannabis or

615
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,919
the

616
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,159
the endocannabinoid system yeah yeah no

617
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,799
exactly they have

618
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,080
everybody has such little amount of time

619
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,158
and mental bandwidth

620
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,278
um to wrestle with much of anything that

621
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,200
to

622
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,200
try to tackle all this is is definitely

623
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,120
complicated and something that i

624
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,798
i teach about is

625
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:28,558
try to urge people to be cautious

626
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:30,798
when reading research and trying to

627
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,639
project the clinical value of that

628
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:36,000
because so much of

629
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,400
cannabinoid research um you know is

630
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,240
cell culture models and rodent models

631
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,440
and a little bit of human clinical data

632
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,919
and it's all interesting

633
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,798
and it there's wisdom to be gleaned from

634
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,640
all these

635
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,079
these different studies but it's you've

636
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,559
got to be really careful

637
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,798
well yeah let's use an example and i

638
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:53,759
want to go back to the hepatic damage

639
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,038
from cbd

640
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,679
issue there was uh an

641
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,038
article that came out recently it was a

642
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,840
rodent study

643
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,798
the doses of cannabidiol that they were

644
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,639
using

645
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:11,918
purportedly producing liver damage

646
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,038
would be impossible to attain uh

647
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,080
in a human and somehow this

648
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:21,440
travesty passed peer review and was

649
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:24,319
widely reported by the media

650
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,480
it has no correspondence to reality i

651
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,839
just wish that had been sent to me

652
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,880
and i would have done my best to ensure

653
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:36,480
that it didn't deserve publication

654
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,278
and um this kind of thing

655
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,360
unfortunately this kind of material is

656
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:44,960
often produced

657
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:46,879
with uh taxpayer money yeah

658
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,519
and it's more than intellectually

659
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,679
dishonest it's downright dangerous

660
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,558
and unethical yeah and it just

661
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,759
perpetuates

662
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,879
more misunderstanding among um

663
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,640
not just a lay audience but um

664
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,559
physicians and other health care

665
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,120
providers that are working

666
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:06,399
with patients that are reporting use and

667
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,918
trying to conceptualize what that means

668
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,640
well i know that i got

669
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,080
10 personal queries about it that i had

670
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,360
to address and

671
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:21,199
dispel what are just furious rumors and

672
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:24,479
um basically propaganda yeah

673
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:29,038
um what

674
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:32,038
what would you say would be some of the

675
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,759
more real risks limitations

676
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:37,359
contraindications

677
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:39,519
of herbal cannabis use

678
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,798
and extracts depending however you want

679
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,918
to go with that that you think people

680
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,960
should know about

681
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,559
well we've got a public health crisis

682
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,840
out there right now with

683
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:53,038
um additives in vape pens yeah yeah

684
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:56,158
um so i've got to mention that uh

685
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:59,440
it is important that people

686
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,799
again apply critical thought

687
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,200
uh to any development like this that

688
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,960
actually has nothing to do with cannabis

689
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,720
yeah it has everything to

690
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,679
to do with additives that are toxic

691
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,558
that are put in these devices and so it

692
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,679
can happen

693
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,158
with nicotine vape pens it could happen

694
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,679
with

695
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,640
cannabis vape pens or whatever

696
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,519
but i i i'll put the finger on the

697
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,919
government

698
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,359
um you wouldn't have this situation if

699
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,200
we had

700
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:37,199
legal commerce federally

701
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,840
in cannabis and had standards applied to

702
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,159
any of these products because this is a

703
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:46,000
hundred percent preventable

704
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,080
um if these things were available and

705
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,038
regulated properly there would be no

706
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,720
need for kids to be going to a street

707
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,038
corner to purchase

708
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,319
black market vape pens with dangerous

709
00:27:55,038 --> 00:28:00,480
ingredients

710
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,480
so that's first and foremost

711
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,798
very briefly um i'm not a proponent of

712
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,159
smoking anything particularly in a

713
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:11,200
medical setting

714
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,600
uh vaporization potentially is

715
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,319
a safer approach but when we're talking

716
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:20,398
about medical uses of cannabis

717
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:24,558
we're almost always uh talking about

718
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:28,398
chronic conditions and in that situation

719
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:32,240
best approaches are for oral agents or

720
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:35,199
tinctures say in the mouth uh even

721
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,278
and there are reasons for that when that

722
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,880
type of preparation is used it's got a

723
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:41,759
much longer half-life

724
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,120
basically the need for more frequent

725
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,319
dosing is limited

726
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:49,599
often people can treat their condition

727
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,759
with dosing two or three times a day

728
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,639
this offers other advantages in that

729
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:56,558
there are fewer

730
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,480
peaks and valleys of activity you avoid

731
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,240
what can happen with inhalation where

732
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,200
there's a rapid

733
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,759
increase in blood and brain levels that

734
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,120
is

735
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:09,038
going to uh make a person prone to

736
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,079
psychoactive side effects

737
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:14,319
specifically anxiety paranoia

738
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,439
things of this sort that are much less

739
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,639
likely

740
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,440
with a slow titration slow raising of

741
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,799
dose

742
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:27,840
with an oral agent and therefore

743
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:30,879
the risks of intoxication reinforcement

744
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:34,000
withdrawal and all these other effects

745
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,000
can be minimized

746
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,120
again the ingredients are key

747
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:43,199
people need to know and that can only

748
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:46,000
come through regulation because

749
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,919
it is a situation i can say without a

750
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,319
lot of fear

751
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,679
of contradiction that companies are not

752
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,879
going to

753
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,919
produce lab results unless it's mandated

754
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,159
yeah yeah

755
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,080
no it's all about the bottom line and if

756
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,600
something isn't required

757
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,678
companies are not going to spend the

758
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:06,319
money

759
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,960
but there's a happy balance there it has

760
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,480
to come

761
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,880
on the side of safety yeah yeah i

762
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,798
totally agree and that's that's a

763
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,399
an area of things i've directly

764
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:17,918
associated with spend a lot of time

765
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,158
working analytical labs

766
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,759
helping them get accredited and onboard

767
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,120
methods and

768
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:28,398
i've seen the response from producers

769
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:30,158
that you know complain about you know

770
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,079
the testing that they're required to do

771
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,679
and the cost of it and you know i'm

772
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:35,918
always thinking about like

773
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,200
what's that total cost of you know the

774
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,799
few hundred dollars to a thousand

775
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,480
dollars you might be spending on testing

776
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:41,918
versus the value of the whole

777
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,679
batch of material you have and

778
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,880
everything but um

779
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,880
it is a struggle um and even producers

780
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,320
that say they value

781
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,278
product quality and consumer safety and

782
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,879
everything i

783
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,278
see a lot of that go out the door really

784
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,278
quickly

785
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,558
when they're allowed to kind of skirt by

786
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,960
it's

787
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:07,678
unfortunate but it is what it is um

788
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,600
what are going back to the

789
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,080
endocannabinoid system a bit and we

790
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,959
talked

791
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:15,119
about a couple of things but what are

792
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,480
some misconceptions that you think

793
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:21,918
that people commonly have

794
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:25,278
about the endocannabinoid system um

795
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,519
i'm sure you have a few in mind

796
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:29,519
well the main problem again is ignorance

797
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,120
just lack of awareness and this is

798
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,159
across the board it

799
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:36,079
really man on the street

800
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,080
probably doesn't know anything about it

801
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:41,199
but again

802
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:44,960
his physician won't likely either

803
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,080
so a big part of my mission over the 23

804
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,000
years i've been

805
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:53,839
doing this work has been education

806
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,398
but i think the message i'd like to

807
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,918
impart

808
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:59,278
is this is an important aspect of how we

809
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,278
work

810
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:06,880
what can we do um even apart from

811
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:09,278
drugs to improve

812
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,159
our endocannabinoid tone and there's

813
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:12,159
actually a lot

814
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,440
the paramount lifestyle approaches

815
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,000
that would affect the system would be

816
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,200
first

817
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,240
aerobic exercise we've got good

818
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,960
data especially from animals and limited

819
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,919
in humans that show that

820
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,038
you improve your endocannabinoid tone

821
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,519
and

822
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,640
overall well-being through aerobic

823
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,640
activity

824
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,679
uh humans weren't designed to be

825
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,640
sedentary as

826
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,600
is prevalent in modern society and the

827
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,519
other one

828
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,240
which seems to be taking on more and

829
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:51,359
more importance is the microbiome

830
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:55,440
the bacterial content of the gut

831
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:58,479
a lot of the ills of modern society

832
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,080
or nutritional and origin we're seeing a

833
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,000
huge increase

834
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:07,519
in things such as the metabolic syndrome

835
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,640
type 2 diabetes associated with obesity

836
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,000
again this is not normal in human

837
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,399
populations

838
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:20,480
in contrast um

839
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:22,839
we're seeing a situation in which

840
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,120
the american diet in particular is

841
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:29,199
pro-inflammatory yeah

842
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:34,079
as well as having an improper

843
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:38,159
balance of nutrients generally too much

844
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:40,398
but a lot of this can be counteracted by

845
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,399
having a better bacterial balance in the

846
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:45,518
gut and that can be attained

847
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,398
through eating more vegetables more

848
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,679
fiber

849
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:52,879
and particularly use of probiotics

850
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,640
and prebiotics and this

851
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,000
can make a tremendous difference in

852
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,440
health and

853
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,159
regulating the endocannabinoid system

854
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,919
and i was going to ask is there any

855
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,799
specific research that you're aware of

856
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,120
that is

857
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,559
currently looking at those links between

858
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:11,039
the gut microbiome

859
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,320
and cannabinoid receptor expression or

860
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,440
endocannabinoid

861
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,039
production yeah it's a developing area

862
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,440
um there was a very interesting study

863
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:22,960
that was done in canada clooney at all

864
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,039
that showed uh

865
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:30,398
that thc didn't uh

866
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:32,878
uh produces uh

867
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,480
a better balance in the microbiome we

868
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:38,239
don't see

869
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,960
development of obesity in animals that

870
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:44,319
are administered thc rather they remain

871
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,960
lean even in the face of

872
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,000
a high fat diet and a genetic

873
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,960
predisposition

874
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,440
to that kind of problem uh so it is a

875
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,960
real

876
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,918
developing area um you know i see that

877
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,599
as really key

878
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:02,639
and a key lifestyle yeah approach

879
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:06,720
uh some people can

880
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:09,039
use this kind of dietary approach and

881
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,239
hopefully not even need cannabis quite

882
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,159
so much

883
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,838
yeah and one thing that's exciting to me

884
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,960
is newer research coming out that's

885
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,119
showing how

886
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,039
different flavonoids interact with the

887
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,240
endocannabinoid system because it

888
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:25,440
it then opens this discussion up uh

889
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:27,199
much more broadly um to talk about

890
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,119
i mean and there are multiple reasons

891
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,838
for that flavonoids are one but

892
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,640
to talk about um diet and consumption of

893
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,400
different types of

894
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:37,279
plants and everything that are also

895
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,039
going to be affecting

896
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,720
cannabinoid receptor signaling and

897
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:41,599
endocannabinoid production that sort of

898
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:43,919
thing

899
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,200
and something that excites me about

900
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,838
cannabis in general

901
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,358
as a natural products guy because that's

902
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:50,400
really my background doesn't come from

903
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,679
cannabis but i've

904
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,079
adopted the realm of cannabis given

905
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:56,239
what's

906
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,000
going on these days is i like that it's

907
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:01,118
kind of a springboard for people

908
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,119
learning about other plants and

909
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,720
you know other concepts and

910
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,000
rediscovering that oh maybe we should be

911
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,799
exercising and

912
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,920
eating better and maybe that will help

913
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,119
medically

914
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,519
more so than a lot of other approaches

915
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,039
um one of the last things i'd like to

916
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,159
get into

917
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,239
check our time here we've got a little

918
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,519
bit more time um

919
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:23,279
going back around to your work with

920
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,400
sativex and looping around i'm sure a

921
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,359
lot of people are thinking

922
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,440
okay cannabis has therapeutic value

923
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:32,480
there's research going on it's

924
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,960
becoming more and more accepted

925
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,719
there's also a major push by a lot of

926
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,960
companies right now to get cannabinoid

927
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:42,000
pharmaceuticals developed

928
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,358
so can you and i know it can be kind of

929
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,440
complicated but as

930
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,279
briefly as you feel comfortable kind of

931
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,159
describe to listeners

932
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,000
what it actually takes to get a cannabis

933
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,279
based pharmaceutical or cannabinoid

934
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,800
pharmaceutical

935
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,000
actually developed trialled and approved

936
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,240
because i think that process is a little

937
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,880
more complicated than than folks give it

938
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,159
credit for

939
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,960
ah yeah it sure is um

940
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,559
in most respects the development of a

941
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,559
cannabis-based medicine as a

942
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,440
pharmaceutical is the same for anything

943
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:13,679
else

944
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,280
but cannabis is a botanical a

945
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,358
plant-based medicine

946
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,720
there's still a common misconception out

947
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:20,799
there that you can't make a

948
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:23,919
pharmaceutical from a plant

949
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,960
but it has been done

950
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,358
and even though sativex isn't available

951
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,440
uh in this country it is approved in 30

952
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:34,480
other countries and it passed

953
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,920
the chemistry manufacturing control and

954
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:41,358
the safety

955
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:44,720
signals but basically what's involved

956
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:47,519
is you have to take your preparation and

957
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,519
show that it's safe through toxicology

958
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,880
this means giving large amounts

959
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:54,880
unfortunately

960
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:59,280
to rats and dogs and seeing what happens

961
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,599
then it's put through phase one in which

962
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,599
normal people get are exposed to the

963
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,160
drug in varying amounts

964
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,760
and you see how long it lasts in the the

965
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,559
body in the blood

966
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,680
and what the reactions of people are

967
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,799
monitoring the

968
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:18,239
side effects if any then

969
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,960
uh it goes to phase two in this moderate

970
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,279
numbers

971
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,480
of patients with a specific disease or

972
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,880
given the drug

973
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,320
and again you're looking for sick

974
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,760
efficacy

975
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,200
safety and then the other factor is

976
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,079
consistency

977
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:35,439
can you show that your drug if it's a

978
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,079
botanical it's going to

979
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,039
contain many ingredients you have to

980
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,680
show

981
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:46,880
consistency of each component within

982
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:49,679
very tight tolerances over the duration

983
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,000
of the drug development program the

984
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,319
final step is phase three in which

985
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,519
large numbers of people with the disease

986
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,519
are given

987
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:02,880
the medicine again to show safety

988
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:06,000
efficacy and consistency at a point

989
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,160
where a drug is passed all those steps

990
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,358
it's fda approved and then it takes

991
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,799
about a year

992
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,960
to designate a

993
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,359
schedule you know if it's a drug that

994
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,480
has psychoactive effects it has to be

995
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:23,199
put in a schedule

996
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,639
that describes what its drug abuse

997
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,598
liability is

998
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,239
whether it has addictive potential how

999
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,760
often

1000
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:36,479
a physician can prescribe it etc etc

1001
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,760
and then label is developed and it goes

1002
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,240
on the market

1003
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,320
so we're talking about generally from

1004
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,598
start to finish a seven to ten year

1005
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,160
proposition

1006
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:49,200
that will cost anywhere between 700

1007
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:52,960
million and 1.2 billion dollars

1008
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:56,000
easy right right yes yeah no problem but

1009
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,119
um so that's one aspect of cannabis

1010
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,838
as medicine however as we're seeing now

1011
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,880
in this country cannabidiol has been

1012
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:06,400
available in

1013
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,400
various preparations

1014
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,559
on another level where people can access

1015
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,000
it without

1016
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,679
a prescription so in the future they're

1017
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,679
going to be other cannabis based

1018
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:20,639
supplements

1019
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,399
these should be also subject to safety

1020
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:25,279
and efficacy

1021
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,160
issues as well as labeling and we've got

1022
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,359
a final

1023
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,000
uh level or echelon of activity which

1024
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:32,719
would be

1025
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,800
someone grows cannabis and may use it in

1026
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:37,118
a medical context

1027
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,079
so uh there are these three different

1028
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,039
ways

1029
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,119
of getting cannabis medicine i think

1030
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,599
people make a mistake when they think

1031
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,039
that

1032
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:50,079
one level can eliminate the others

1033
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:53,759
much as the government thought that

1034
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:57,440
marinol thc would uh

1035
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,400
reduce or eliminate the issue of medical

1036
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,679
cannabis uh it never happened it never

1037
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,240
will happen

1038
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,838
similarly we've got some counterculture

1039
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,799
people that

1040
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,838
would just like to free the herb so to

1041
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,760
speak

1042
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,679
and forget about these other areas of

1043
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,960
commerce god forbid

1044
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:20,239
a company would make money uh

1045
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,440
on something that uh is god-given

1046
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:26,719
um but again those are extremes

1047
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:30,000
of philosophy i think yeah yeah

1048
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:31,039
i agree um completely and um there are

1049
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,239
some

1050
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:36,239
you know like you alluded to already

1051
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:37,279
examples of how botanicals can be

1052
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,639
treated

1053
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,640
in a highly controlled manner um i mean

1054
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:44,799
one example is looking internationally

1055
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,480
at how how drugs are handled differently

1056
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,000
but even in the united states i mean you

1057
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,599
can get

1058
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,440
you know like a standardized ginkgo

1059
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,920
biloba extract absolutely

1060
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,039
and get a prescription for it um right

1061
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,159
when i'm advising

1062
00:41:55,039 --> 00:42:01,880
patients you know i i indicate just that

1063
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:04,159
um the best ginkgo biloba extracts or

1064
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,079
egb61

1065
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,000
these are developed in germany where

1066
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,200
they have a thing called commission e

1067
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,880
which is

1068
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:12,559
analogous to food and drug

1069
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,680
administration for herbal

1070
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:18,960
products so these things

1071
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:22,480
can be uh as safe and

1072
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,960
effective or even more so uh than

1073
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,920
new chemical entities and prescription

1074
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,559
drugs

1075
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,079
yeah i guess we'll just see how how the

1076
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,639
fda decides to

1077
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,119
to wrap their minds around all this well

1078
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,078
i can

1079
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,160
guarantee it'll be a slow process

1080
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,880
because the level of understanding is

1081
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:41,598
not there

1082
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,519
and it's hampered greatly by residual

1083
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,200
prejudices

1084
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,639
yeah yeah i think there was there was an

1085
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,838
assumption when the farm bill passed

1086
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:50,078
that all of a sudden

1087
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:51,679
cbd was legal and we're going to be able

1088
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,760
to make dietary supplements

1089
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:56,480
well yeah i mean there's friction in the

1090
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,240
law congress said it's legal

1091
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:03,838
uh uh the fda and the dea

1092
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:06,879
still consider all forms of cannabidiol

1093
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,400
apart from epidialxia schedule one

1094
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,280
forbidden compounds

1095
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,720
yeah yeah and and the last thing that

1096
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,240
i've heard

1097
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:16,399
privately from folks that are trying to

1098
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:19,199
interact with the work working groups

1099
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,358
with the fda and cbd is that they're not

1100
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,399
they're not very optimistic that the fda

1101
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:26,799
is going to

1102
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,280
um provide much allowance for

1103
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,640
cbd and dietary supplements and and

1104
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,359
foods and that sort of thing

1105
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:36,400
now we've seen this in europe already

1106
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:40,000
they have a novel foods regulation

1107
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,599
that basically is eliminated most

1108
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,880
cbd containing products from the shelves

1109
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:50,720
yeah yeah so we'll see how it goes

1110
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,680
um uh before we sign off here i want to

1111
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,559
make sure to

1112
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,679
to get you going we have a conference to

1113
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,559
get to and everything

1114
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:00,159
um is there anything um we haven't

1115
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,159
talked about that in the

1116
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,199
the last two or three minutes here you

1117
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:05,679
want to

1118
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,239
make sure to share with anybody or even

1119
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:07,358
just

1120
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,919
bringing up some of the work you're

1121
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:12,719
doing um people can learn more

1122
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,440
sure well a big focus of my attention

1123
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,199
right now

1124
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,760
is um trying to educate and i like to

1125
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,879
use the catch term making cannabis safer

1126
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,680
and better

1127
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,559
and that encompasses a lot of different

1128
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,519
approaches

1129
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:29,199
but again i think we need better

1130
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:33,039
genetics

1131
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:36,960
for cannabis this is a very um malleable

1132
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:39,599
plant we can make it do anything

1133
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,318
that we want there is not the need in my

1134
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,519
opinion

1135
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:46,719
for a genetic modification of cannabis

1136
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:49,280
or to make it from yeast

1137
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,078
the full entourage of compounds in

1138
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,240
cannabis can

1139
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:56,160
be optimized by selective breeding

1140
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,078
without resorting to those other

1141
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,199
approaches

1142
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,920
and the future is very bright in terms

1143
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,039
of

1144
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,720
what can be done again i'd emphasize

1145
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:11,838
safety standards should be paramount

1146
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,199
consumers need to be asking hard

1147
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:15,838
questions

1148
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:19,039
not just of their doctors but of the

1149
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:22,559
purveyors of these products

1150
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,279
and i think marshalling our forces

1151
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,000
together

1152
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,079
we can greatly improve the situation as

1153
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,519
well as the public health

1154
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,800
yeah i i totally agree i i know we still

1155
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:36,079
have a long road ahead

1156
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,599
as far as education goes and everything

1157
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,000
but there's progress being made all the

1158
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,920
time and i greatly appreciate the work

1159
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,599
you're doing i hope our paths cross

1160
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,159
again

1161
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,200
and perhaps you know maybe sometime in

1162
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:48,799
the future we'll be able to do some

1163
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:51,358
educating together

1164
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,720
um thanks so much for being willing to

1165
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:54,480
to spend the

1166
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:55,759
time this morning to get together and

and talk with me i've

1168
