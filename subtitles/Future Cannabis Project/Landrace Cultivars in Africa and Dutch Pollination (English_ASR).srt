1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,160
you see in pockets and material in

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,778
Africa that still goes back in time like

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,019
that hasn't had the Dutch infiltration

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:13,710
that see like when I when I was over in

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:16,170
Hawaii in the in the mid 80s it was the

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,510
last of the Southeast Asian varietals

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,010
grown in the cane fields and so I go

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,618
there and I get to experience some

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,679
world-class cannabis and it was perfect

10
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:28,320
because the soils the climate all

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,928
matched up with those type of plants and

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,450
so you had this incredible combination

13
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:36,420
and then I go back you know years and

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,250
years later and I got this uh this white

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,200
kid that's telling me about you need to

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,520
check out the aloha white widow and I

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,230
was like that's not what I'm looking for

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,730
I'm looking for the cambodian that used

19
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:45,808
to grow out here that used to take top

20
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:46,738
your head off make you almost peed your

21
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:49,919
pants you had to sit on the toilet

22
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:51,869
smoking um where's that and they're like

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,309
oh no no you want the white widow and

24
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:55,288
I'm like no I don't want the white widow

25
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:57,149
I know the white widow is like what I

26
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,500
want is the things that were from here

27
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:03,120
did did Africa have the ability to hold

28
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,530
material in constant do you still have

29
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,379
to because someone whose discover in

30
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,680
stock because to me I'm like Afghanistan

31
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:13,438
got hammered all over Asia got hammered

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,840
from war Africa had so much war and

33
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,609
famine and issues as you're mining

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,460
material you stable to mine some of that

35
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:22,500
killer stuff from the past or is it it's

36
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,719
getting polluted quickly it's it really

37
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,759
is it's hard to find like I was in this

38
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,310
last year went to through Ethiopian than

39
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,799
this Seychelles Islands right there and

40
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,879
it's even finding these old land races

41
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,680
where all of a sudden it's like oh these

42
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,478
guys were here from Amsterdam a couple

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,200
years ago and we have a white widow

44
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:43,140
mango that we open pollinated with all

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,939
our land rate stuff so all of a sudden

46
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,079
is this with what's happening is it's

47
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,179
harder and harder to find

48
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,529
from from Africa and that was years ago

49
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,118
Southeast Asia

50
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,180
you know I traveled through Vietnam

51
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,310
Cambodia lout Thailand

52
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,530
area trying to and then even that was

53
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,600
mid 90s and you're still running across

54
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,599
places where people had brought other

55
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:06,509
genetics in so this is one thing going

56
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,909
back in this diversification and being

57
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,370
able to keep things from their from the

58
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:12,639
origin you know in Southeast Asia India

59
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,950
African

60
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:20,469
keep these genetics separate and being

61
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:23,530
able to do to do testing and that's like

62
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:25,330
the kind of the back step of documenting

63
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,099
this but like yeah Africa it's it's

64
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,920
anywhere in the world right now it's

65
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:32,620
like Irian Jaya Papua New Guinea you're

66
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:36,849
going there in these areas people have

67
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,159
been there with cannabis or him it's

68
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:41,379
amazing because you know for me for my

69
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,639
background from being in cannabis when

70
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:45,789
it was coming over from all these places

71
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:48,909
throughout the year in cycle it just let

72
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:51,370
me experience a range of effects that I

73
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:53,079
don't experience now I called most of

74
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,870
the stuff we play with now homogenized

75
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,959
cannabis and what I want is I want to be

76
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:01,180
able to have these unique directions to

77
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:06,400
fit what I want to do and how I want to

78
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:07,629
feel and I people try to tell me that

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,550
you know it's your imagination

80
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:11,109
that you're you're dreaming that things

81
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,850
will better at that time and I said oh

82
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,800
no they they had unbelievable effects

83
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:16,569
and the directions were phenomenal and

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,850
they were very unique in the way they

85
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:20,829
sent on how you made you feel and you

86
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,329
just you don't see this except in some

87
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:24,129
very rare cultivars so we see stuff

88
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,959
that's highly marketable and a quality

89
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:27,189
but like you know you working with some

90
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:28,450
of that stuff that panama's I remember

91
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:32,530
some killer panama's that was just

92
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:33,789
thumping and the the flavor profiles

93
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,699
were unique in the way it made you feel

94
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:38,590
was unique and the problem is that as

95
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:40,179
soon as we started to hybridize it down

96
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,530
so that it would work in our climates as

97
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,019
soon as we started to try to bring it

98
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,299
indoor we basically just started calling

99
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:49,019
and out of existence and we dumbed it

100
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:51,099
down do we turn the qualities down and

101
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,420
if you know for me when I try to get

102
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,620
when I meet people that like you like

103
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:55,000
I've known you for a long time but I

104
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,500
know that you're you know you scour in

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,810
the earth and I'm always like did you

106
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,400
find some goodies someplace you know is

107
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,129
the goodies still remaining somewhere

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,329
and and and unfortunately the goodies

109
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:06,069
are out there but they're just not

110
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:09,549
markers you know for though for the most

111
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:12,219
part but the some of these cultivars

112
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,840
that take 14 weeks that the flowers

113
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:18,250
still have 14 weeks is like a football

114
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,228
and it hasn't filled in but but this is

115
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,240
something that it's good to have in the

116
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:25,360
toolbox you know let's not get let's 9

117
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,199
you get let this go and I think right

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,180
now that's

119
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,699
these different unique cultivars that we

120
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,680
run into it's keep it alive or share it

121
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:35,500
with somebody else and you know it's

122
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,959
like that it's like cannabinoids that

123
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,310
feed your endocannabinoids you know

124
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,849
everybody's different and that's that's

125
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,589
the thing something that one strain it's

126
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,900
like is that could be that key that

127
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:48,250
helps you like with epilepsy it's 3 to 5

128
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:50,649
percent right of people that are

129
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,290
affected by say Charlotte's Web but what

130
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:55,089
are they cannabinoids within that

131
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,100
cultivar that are accessing your endo

132
00:04:55,089 --> 00:05:00,279
cannabinoid profile and that's something

133
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:03,629
collecting big data right now going into

134
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:06,879
this on the pharmacogenetic level is

135
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:09,870
identifying these genetics plant

136
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,610
genetics and then a person's makeup and

137
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,389
seeing that 80 year old lady that's in

138
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,879
Australia that just got help from a

139
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,529
certain profile and helped her epilepsy

140
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,860
epilepsy and then you have a 3 year old

141
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:26,289
child in America or somewhere else that

142
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,689
you'd never know that this particular

143
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,700
balance of a one to one fight and that's

144
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:32,980
something working one and was finding

145
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:35,500
these old land races from from Africa as

146
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,509
well but developing a full cannabinoid

147
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:43,230
profile you know what I'm talking like 5

148
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:45,670
percent THC 5 CBD 5 CB n CB g CB DV HCV

149
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,290
flatline across the board or these

150
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,660
different profiles and then when you

151
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:52,180
identify a cultivar like that being able

152
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,480
to put it in vitro and you put that on

153
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,480
the show
