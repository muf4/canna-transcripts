1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
navigating the regulations trying to

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,490
figure out how to get into the market

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,859
how to get into the market legally how

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,580
to build partnerships that are scalable

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,259
has been you know a big part of what

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,789
we've been trying to do and then on the

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,379
fundraising side there's obviously like

8
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,089
a lot of interest and a lot of money but

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,550
again finding those partners that can

10
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:21,778
bring value as well as those partners

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,420
that are strategically aligned to the

12
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:26,429
type of growth that you want to have and

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,730
kind of keeping this especially as I

14
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:32,238
guess Outsiders to the industry is not

15
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,200
those that have been in the gray market

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,029
one of the things that's been important

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,190
to us though has been actually working

18
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,829
with small farmers and we have an

19
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:42,599
established relationship with a licensed

20
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,219
farm in medicine oh it's a big part of

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,289
it but some of the pushback we've

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,829
actually gotten from some investors as

23
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,570
well as as well as some manufacturers

24
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,549
that we've talked about partnering with

25
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,649
has been oh like you don't need to do

26
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:57,328
that like we've got this stuff that's

27
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,590
grown in this warehouse and you should

28
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,179
just roll forward with this it's much

29
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,280
cheaper and it's much easier and like we

30
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,920
can make that happen much quicker so

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,629
finding those partners that are have

32
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,840
that value alignment has been a little

33
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:11,938
more difficult for us but something that

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,700
we're working on and what's your product

35
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:19,519
oh yes if the product drew Martin is a

36
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:23,900
line of botanically infused freerolls so

37
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:26,759

38
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:32,299
botanicals that have been formulated by

39
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,299
