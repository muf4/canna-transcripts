1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,078
mm-hmm

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:14,439
[Music]

3
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:19,858
it's like I have people who send me

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,560
seeds to give out for free to other

5
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,500
people and I love when they give me

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,618
specific notes like one guy did a lot of

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,300
this breeding in like Maine yeah so he

8
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,238
was breeding for similar things to I

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,880
think like the Washington state area

10
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:38,759
uh uh and so when I know people are in

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,579
those climates I'll send them something

12
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,558
like that yeah no you're you're trying

13
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,500
you're trying to like if it works for

14
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,179
them too because that'd be cool

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,878
they're similar just the main main comes

16
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:54,679
in colder quicker so they're both wet

17
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:58,820
but Maine has a fucking a definitive

18
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,820
it's like a short Runway yeah

19
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:05,338
Washington Pacific Northwest is going to

20
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,359
be warm and temporary for a while it's

21
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:12,840
gonna be really mold you know 50.

22
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:15,299
yeah 50 degrees in and 80 humidity so

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,219
but it allows you to be able to steer

24
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,080
people in the right way and

25
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:20,158
that what we were all talking about you

26
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,019
know earlier how do you get people to

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,659
want to educate the only way you really

28
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:26,519
get education is through interest

29
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,259
and and what you have to do no better

30
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,938
way than hobby growing growing exactly

31
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,799
growing a plant I don't care coffee is

32
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:33,419
not addictive but growing it sure is

33
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,220
well and the Hobby and the hobby The

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,400
Hobby

35
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:41,700
relationship starts to make you more of

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,219
uh detail freak yeah and just understand

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,600
it like whoa it goes like that I'm

38
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:47,640
amazed and you start to figure out

39
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,379
really what you like and so what you

40
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,239
find isn't that just because it's grown

41
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,739
organically outdoor which is what I'm

42
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,599
into doesn't mean that you have to like

43
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,039
it most you might like Athena in

44
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,379
rockwool because that's your fucking

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,640
mouth and you're not wrong yes you're

46
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,259
not wrong

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,579
it's just that what you have to be able

48
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,719
to do is have people be able to

49
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:06,059
experience enough different

50
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,219
methodologies to understand where is

51
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,080
their preference so when they go to the

52
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,719
store they can ask better questions of

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,280
the tender and it's not so much for me I

54
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,780
make it I'm like I'm if I if I don't

55
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,919
think that there's a huge knowledge base

56
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,680
here I'm like okay you got anything

57
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,659
that's uh any any Farm that's running

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,180
outdoor do you have an outdoor section

59
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:26,280
you got a sun grown section and you know

60
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,140
that it's always going to be older pot

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,400
it'll always be older pot than any of

62
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:31,738
the newer pot in terms when you look at

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,060
the date so but what I know is that if I

64
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,099
can go through and I can then look at

65
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,598
the I could look at the cultivars I can

66
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:38,340
kind of figure out which one's held up

67
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:40,799
best to storage because I kind of know

68
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,360
from playing with them and I go oh this

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,060
one usually holds up really good and I

70
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,040
think the antioxidants

71
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,239
and this Farm's out of Sonoma and so you

72
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,859
break when you get it out of the car you

73
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,599
break it open you go there you go and

74
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,340
the smell is slight because it's faded

75
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,959
but as soon as you crush it it's bumping

76
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,300
and you know the mouth is going to be

77
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,280
there the store ability and huge and

78
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,140
that lets me but that lets me be a more

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,878
intelligent Shopper if I'm shopping at

80
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,259
dispensaries out of the area if I'm out

81
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,000
of the area and I want to go explore

82
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:07,378
dispensaries I go and have fun with the

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,239
blood tenders and I'm like what do you

84
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:10,560
got what's hot what are people enjoying

85
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,239
right now what do you like if I wasn't

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,098
busting what's the best thing that

87
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,780
you've seen come in this week and what's

88
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:17,158
something to caught your eye and what do

89
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,840
you what do you uh what do you notice

90
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:20,459
and it allows them to be able to be

91
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,780
creative in the thought process and then

92
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,158
it allows them to be able to steer

93
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,439
directions and then you're also able to

94
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:28,199
say okay what I like is I like these

95
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,699
things I I also like to explore what

96
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,560
other people are into it's like if

97
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,839
someone introduces you to their music

98
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,759
collection and you're just like play me

99
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,039
what you like and they're like in some

100
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,098
direction you're like it's not my thing

101
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,679
but within within that thing I like what

102
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:46,018
you like totally like totally well you

103
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,360
can also appreciate the the detail of

104
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,819
the individuality

105
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,480
it's nice not to all be the same it's

106
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:55,859
nice that it's nice to have enough

107
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:58,318
commonality that we can all get together

108
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,519
but enough differentiation so that we're

109
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:00,958
never bored looking at each other

110
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,180
because every time I see you doing

111
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,878
different shit that I don't do you makes

112
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,620
me interested you know um everybody's

113
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:11,039
got some weird shit they do that's cool

114
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,799
and I think that that's that's a it's

115
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,738
important but being a home grower lets

116
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,660
you touch the product in a way that

117
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,238
helps you really understand what you

118
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,100
like and what you don't and you're able

119
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,299
to become a far more educated individual

120
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,360
and the only other way that you can

121
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,040
understand products it's like building

122
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,919
your own sneaker almost you have

123
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,100
non-biased tasting panels and I mean

124
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:37,439
non-bias wear like and when I when I we

125
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,340
sometimes companies will ask me to help

126
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,918
them

127
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:43,619
release products to the public

128
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:46,198
and what I do is I bring people in to

129
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,639
communicate to the audience what these

130
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,160
products are

131
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,199
and what I make sure is that the people

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,900
that we bring in

133
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,639
are unbiased in what they're talking

134
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:57,899
about they're not telling you what the

135
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,019
fuck they like or what they don't like

136
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:04,198
that is not a relevant topic here what's

137
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:06,719
relevant is this is what this is these

138
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,660
are relatable flavors and scents

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,759
please try and now what it does is it

140
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,639
allows people to make unbiased decisions

141
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,460
as the consumer and they're not catching

142
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,460
your your your your direction of I only

143
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:23,219
like OG I only like hella jelly and I

144
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:25,680
only like it grown on the floodplains of

145
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,780
the Eel River in the in the in the crook

146
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,100
where the sawdust used to catch you know

147
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:30,839
what I mean because even there's those

148
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,580
little details right

149
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,500
you can't sing any of that shit we get

150
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,879
that cold air at night right in July

151
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,399
that cools it down right when that's

152
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,719
right

153
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:40,978
and people like what the fuck are you

154
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,320
talking about the ultimate tear water

155
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:44,758
yes but most people don't understand

156
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:46,740
what that means

157
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,300
and so it just becomes overwhelming and

158
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,759
what you want is you want relatable

159
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,020
scents and flavors and you're simplify

160
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,759
it and make it presentable it's so

161
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,779
approachable yes so say like you and I

162
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,919
we're gonna we're gonna bring this

163

gold we're gonna bring It Forward we'd

166
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,779
smell it me and you would sit down and

167
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,860
say okay what's all our relatable scents

168
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,478
and flavors

169
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,580
and we were doing that earlier we were

170
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,680
pulling up some strong citruses we

171
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,978
grabbed a heavy lime we picked up a

172
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,439
light Tangerine it had a fuel oil in

173
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:18,240
there it had a almost like a rose tone

174
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,459
and from that cherry pie

175
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,340
that what we would do is we would go and

176
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:25,318
gather those those salad and we would

177
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:28,318
bring it to the event

178
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,060
so now when someone says what is this

179
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,240
thing we're like hey this is what this

180
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,538
is this is how it was grown and here are

181
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,918
the relatable scents for you to smell so

182
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:40,740
that you can see if you can pick it up

183
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,359
and so when you're talking about pencil

184
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,978
eraser the best thing you could do for

185
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,960
good gas is is bring a can of tennis

186
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:48,379
balls

187
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:50,879
smell that that's Fuel

188
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:52,379
and what it does is it allows them to

189
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,418
understand what people are talking about

190
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,918
but it also lets them get caught up in

191
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:58,560
patterns

192
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,418
and and your your job though is to just

193
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,699
allow people to understand better what

194
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:06,418
this is how it was grown where it came

195
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,759
from but you never add your influence to

196
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,560
this process because what you're not

197
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,120
trying to do is educate someone to buy

198
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,399
what you want because that's really more

199
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,800
of an infomercial what you're trying to

200
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,799
say is these are all considered good

201
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,079
products you choose what you like among

202
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,259
them because the bottom line is indoor

203
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:28,258
herb that's grown onto chemical is as a

204
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,020
more subtle profile and when we start to

205
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:32,520
go into heavier profiles just because I

206
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,019
like it thick and full doesn't mean

207
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:38,219
everyone else does and that's the same

208
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:40,379
with wine so if if 85 there's no wrong

209
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,539
answer it's all you it's like who's the

210
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,819
consumer and the nose who's the consumer

211
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,860
generally pretty much and if the mouth

212
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:49,259
corresponds yeah yeah there is as long

213
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,598
as there's a just following your nose

214
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,580
through a big palate it'll it'll get you

215
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,839
through it'll get it it'll really hone

216
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:57,060
in on different like almost like

217
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,198
personalities and types of people and

218
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,120
like people that resonate together

219
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,379
you're like wow like you can be totally

220
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,598
different in all kinds of ways but

221
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:06,000
there's like similarities based on you

222
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,019
know who kind of likes what cannabis

223
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,939
yeah yeah there's only to me there's

224
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,038
only four real interactions like when

225
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:12,598
when I when I when I broke down cannabis

226
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,219
in the four divisions right Earth and

227
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:17,098
fuel fruit and fruit and flower fruit

228
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,840
and floral and and that was like that

229
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:21,899
was uh that was it was like a compass

230
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,339
but when I came up with that hypothesis

231
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,719
and said this is how cannabis really

232
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,719
breaks down to me from looking at it

233
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,840
from all these years when I add the the

234
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,278
team from UCLA challenged that and then

235
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,958
fucking prove it that really does break

236
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,538
up into these categories

237
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,158
it allows you to understand that 95 of

238
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:39,598
the population that came into the state

239
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,759
of California looking for a medical card

240
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,740
came in for one of these four reasons

241
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,879
that 95 of the Cannabis we see in the

242
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,360
world basically fits into these four

243
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,360
fucking directions

244
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:56,399
they're directions that fit and our job

245
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:58,259
in cannabis in the industry of cannabis

246
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,839
is to help people just understand where

247
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:02,399
you find your mesh but not for me to

248
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,620
tell you where to find it I can tell you

249
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,179
why I do what I do and why I like what I

250
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,740
like but I'm not telling you that my

251
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,359
shit is going to be better for you than

252
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,459
the shit you like so if you're someone

253
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,200
yeah no cause I'm be honest man that's

254
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,518
what I love about the scratch and sniffs

255
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,440
like putting scratch Snips in front of

256
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,299
like three or four different flavors and

257
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,040
watching people go through them it's

258
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:23,399
just like when they're like really

259
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:25,439
distinctly different varieties of like

260
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,419
real turping cannabis scratch and sniffs

261
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,800
like people light up on different ones

262
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:30,539
and you'll like see like you know

263
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,919
they'll smell like somebody like they'll

264
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,019
be eight people in a row that'll all

265
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,699
love you know the Calia team this like

266
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,959
new line that we just dropped but then

267
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,278
there'll be a bunch of people that'll

268
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,159
come in the they'll love the blueberry

269
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:43,080
pancakes which is like waves and there's

270
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,620
almost like natural waves too yeah yeah

271
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:49,440
there's groups of people yeah flavors

272
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,539
and all flavors have a cycle and some

273
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,760
and some flavors to me like in deep

274
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,500
oranges when they're hot they're

275
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,958
blistering and then when they fall off

276
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,820
it's a vertical and then it disappears

277
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,439
for a while and all of a sudden it comes

278
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,060
back comes up yeah because you can only

279
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,220
take so much of it that's why the

280
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:07,859
skittle's kind of interesting because

281
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,740
the flavor and the skittle didn't

282
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,839
diminish in desirability and when when

283
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,120
that lawsuit went down

284
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,760
Mars did the research on it and said

285
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,919
which was amazing but it was you know if

286
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:23,100
you have Skittle in the gene pool it

287
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:25,139
equal to 17 change in value of your

288
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,240
product in the California Market

289
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,458
which is which is Big so they got sued

290
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,799
Skittle got sued by for the name but

291
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:34,079
Mars candy sued them and so when Mars

292
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,778
candy sues you they're bringing a

293
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,700
research team and a legal team and the

294
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:40,620
data that they so I read the lawsuits I

295
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,180
was just fascinated by it but that was

296
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,980
the quantifier was they said oh yeah

297
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:46,199
we've been injured and money has been

298
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,060
made and we can say that money has been

299
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,160
made by the virtue of the fact that

300
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:53,879
they're they're diminishing our name and

301
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:56,159
they're making 17 more for a Skittle in

302
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,980
a product than a non-skittle product

303
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,659
which blew my mind because there's no

304
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,339
other there's no data that corresponds

305
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:04,799
to that but they they were able to mine

306
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,420
it because they're Mars and it's the

307
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,539
Cannabis industry yeah and they can

308
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:11,159
abuse it got no leg to stand on nope and

309
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:12,958
it's Mars they're they're you know it's

310
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,699
kind of like fucking with Coca-Cola or

311
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,619
you wanna you wanna have a you want to

312
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,620
screw up somebody's life uh add some

313
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,179
Disney to the video

314
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:24,000
[Laughter]

315
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:25,259
oh man but at the end of the day you

316
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,720
know you want you want people to be

317
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:31,559
happy with what they do and for me what

318
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,180
I like is being able to play with new

319
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,039
things and put them out and let people

320
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:38,159
check them out and

321
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,419
kind of just keep the Curiosity peaked

322
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,219
you know the stuff that I do

323
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:43,199
professionally

324
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,440
it's the same thing but it's very

325
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,200
targeted it's you're bringing it is

326
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,700
still down yeah I call it like a

327
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,339
contract killer you're bringing me in to

328
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,079
kill a problem and and that's it that's

329
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,360
why I'm there I'm there for a specific

330
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:59,519
thing I need a Target without the target

331
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,259
I can do nothing like yeah and without

332
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,419
the target I do my thing that's the

333
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:04,559
difference I don't do nothing I do I do

334
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:06,120
your thing but that's not necessarily

335
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,799
the thing exactly needs to be done in

336
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,139
that specifically exactly but those but

337
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,759
but I'm clear about the division and so

338
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,980
I clearly divide them it's very

339
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,799
dichotomous to me so what it does it

340
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,980
allows me to maintain my interest

341
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:23,519
and and what I'm into

342
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,200
so that I never lose like why I why I

343
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,120
really like doing what I'm doing and and

344
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,500
I love the scientific work I get to do

345
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,899
and I love working with some of these

346
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,059
giant fucking operators because you get

347
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:36,659
horsepower you just can't get in the

348
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:38,518
garage you just can't get it you just

349
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:40,679
don't know what it's like to look at 20

350
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,000
fucking thousands yeah do we want to

351
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:43,919
take 10 000 clones do we have the

352
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,740
capability of taking 10 000 clones we do

353
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,539
I want to see okay

354
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,639
I wanna what I and so that way I can see

355
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:52,679
the limit to the left and then I want to

356
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,539
see the two light person who only works

357
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,879
a specific thing for time and comes up

358
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:59,838
with an outlier because there's a purity

359
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:03,000
there that's to me just overwhelmingly

360
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,560
beautiful it's what I love about the

361
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,839
craft community

362
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,399
and and sometimes I'm in the craft

363
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,600
community and sometimes I'm not

364
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,000
dependent on

365
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,759
what I'm working on but I'm always a

366
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,919
smoker like that that's I was a smoker

367
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,139
before I was a grower and I was a smoker

368
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:21,838
and a grower before I was a dealer

369
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,240
and you know so for me I'm always still

370
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,540
a smoker and what I what I really want

371
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,740
to have happen is the desires I want for

372
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:32,159
myself

373
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:35,220
of availability access affordability

374
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,259
Community different genes that we can

375
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,180
work with Gene banks that we can borrow

376
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:41,159
and lend from they don't have to give me

377
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:43,500
the fucking plant but they can sell me a

378
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,419
vial of pollen you know what I'm saying

379
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,159
sure you should be able to sell me a

380
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:49,379
vial Apollo so I can go and pollinate

381
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,519
and work there should be abilities to

382
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:52,980
have

383
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,620
people work and develop in the Cannabis

384
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,240
craft without having to be under an MSO

385
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,740
label without having to be under a Big

386
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,299
Brand label well the msos are looking

387
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,579
for something different I think than the

388
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:04,799
craft like exactly there's not much

389
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:07,439
overlap at all like what they're looking

390
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,500
for in like the you know the Matrix

391
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,120
they're trying to hit is drastic but the

392
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,278
craft copies them though that's the

393
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,600
problem the craft copies the craft

394
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:17,939
doesn't there's a whole different Market

395
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,339
well the craft the craft people are used

396
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,800
to selling the Malibu Dawn they're not

397
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,639
selling the dispensaries needs to start

398
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,639
a distro yeah

399
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:32,220
because it is no fucking point so what

400
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:33,778
the small operator like for me what I do

401
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,639
is I take all the Clone lists that come

402
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:36,480
across my phone right in fucking rivers

403
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,680
of them

404
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,680
and I just screenshot them

405
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:45,539
and I just show somebody and I said hey

406
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,980
watch this I said see this right here I

407
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:48,120
said this same group just hit me up

408
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,519
twice which means they're hungry for

409
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,899
money so we're gonna watch the Clone

410
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,820
price then we're gonna see the Clone

411
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:56,039
price drop then you're gonna see Teen

412
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,120
then you're gonna see one gal and what

413
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,500
they're doing is they're just holding

414
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,120
this fucking plant moving it through

415
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,578
their world because they can't bear to

416
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,278
get rid of it so they're spending

417
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:06,599
fucking 40 bucks to sell you a 10 plan

418
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,860
because they don't catch that nobody

419
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,879
wants the fucking thing and you made too

420
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,740
many of them

421
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,419
and so and taking care of plants is

422
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,860
expensive oh it's tough and and when

423
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,240
you're looking at this these lists it

424
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,940
just lets you understand that when you

425
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,560
see huge quantities coming through just

426
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,480
realize that those things are going to

427
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:23,879
be mostly grown and so that's the pool

428
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,940
you don't belong in as a 400 500 pound

429
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:28,198
operator 400 500 pound operator they're

430
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,240
looking for your Niche which is maybe

431
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:32,278
some Heritage Market that you got into

432
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,899
or you're looking for the next new thing

433
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:36,600
what's that next thing on the horizon

434
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,799
and 10 there right so to me we got like

435
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,600
you know it's kind of the bell curve

436
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,399
right so I go 10 on the left they'll buy

437
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,500
whatever the fuck you sell 10 on the

438
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,958
right you have to basically pay them but

439
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,339
that 80 in the middle is swayable and if

440
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,078
I can move them over to here a little

441
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,240
bit I might even get one percent of the

442
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:53,638
10 on the right to move so I'll get a 91

443
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,500
which puts me into an A and so it's this

444
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,240
middle that I work with of what are they

445
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,839
seeking and what they're seeking is this

446
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,240
this Nexus of quality and value but in a

447
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,579
diversity that's relatively simple so

448
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,139
that you're not having to to try to

449
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:10,319
create too many different Lanes you're

450
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:11,940
saying okay the distro wants 3 things I

451
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,860
take a look at the three things that the

452
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,500
distro wants which is basically into

453
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,500
this box and then I increase

454
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,240
the the the category where the sales are

455
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,860
hottest so right now this year I would

456
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,560
make a prediction I would say if I was

457
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:29,519
to have Indica a sativa and a hybrid I

458
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:32,638
would go more sativa more hybrid less

459
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,078
Indica because what do we see the

460
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,419
steering of what and how what does

461
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:39,899
Indica mean narcotic

462
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:41,879
hybrid balanced sativa ethereal where

463
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,379
have we focused all the work narcotic

464
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,919
because all the gene pools we work with

465
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:49,500
for indoor are that short flowering

466
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,120
cyclical speed of use when we go to

467
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,860
hybrid we start to get into this middle

468
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,879
Zone but people didn't catch that just

469
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,980
because you breed something together

470
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:59,519
that doesn't make it fucking good and on

471
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:02,339
the cerebral end of it that shit is a

472
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,078
project to get necked down into a

473
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,640
desirable level and so everybody goes

474
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,558
you know oh blue dream all of a sudden

475
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,020
then everybody's the same thing you get

476
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:11,279
tired of it how many days in a row do I

477
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:12,000
have to smoke the exact same shit well

478
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,178
if we're going to see this whole

479
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,558
Resurgence at Hayes's training yeah yeah

480
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,880
I think next year we're going to see a

481
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,139
little bit of it come in and over the

482
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,360
next three years it's kind of really

483
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,620
thick but it won't it won't it will it

484
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,318
won't pick up

485
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:27,599
the problem with it is we're not to me

486
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:29,159
what we're doing wrong with this shit is

487
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,319
we're not accepting the fact that we're

488
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,179
not supposed to fucking grow it here

489
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,918
you're not supposed to grow it here I I

490
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,059
fuck around on the equator oh it's a

491
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,200
different looking plant there I'll tell

492
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:39,418
you that much

493
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,340
um we should be growing it there we

494
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,620
should grow things here that are hybrids

495
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:46,019
that that North Americans can grow in

496
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:47,639
our our situation that shine and if

497
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:50,940
you're if you're growing things indoor

498
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,460
for 125 days how much does that cost you

499
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,960
to buy it oh indoors isn't it you know

500
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,279
what I mean so that's why working with

501
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,380
the genetics and bringing in that

502
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,298
trigger time and like actually but

503
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,580
you're you're modernized you're

504
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:04,259
modernizing it and for me when I and I

505
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:06,000
and I play with groups that modernize

506
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:07,798
where like I get to see what it looks

507
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,480
like when you take equatorial Africans

508
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:11,879
and compress them into a fucking soda

509
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,860
can size plant where you've you've

510
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,140
brought them all the way down into this

511
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:18,599
before and all the new autoflowers and

512
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,100
Autoflower conversions yeah but and I

513
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:23,038
and I like those too because you can

514
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:26,099
take the auto the auto Gene and just

515
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:29,220
Revolution lets you understand how to

516
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:31,259
increase Vigor and and speed of a

517
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,480
regular without having to really utilize

518
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:35,038
AI some of those those what we used to

519
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,259
call ruderalis but really Northern

520
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,519
flowering varieties because to me they

521
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:40,679
haven't worked out enough it's been

522
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:41,819
worked out yeah you guys been working

523
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,038
with that shit for a long time I meant

524
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:45,418
Charlie is oh my God like Pepsi Coke

525
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:46,859
challenge you can't tell tell the

526
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,700
difference there's absolutely no

527
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,918
difference there it's actually

528
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,319
preferable we've been seeing like the

529
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,600
all gas the emerald fire and the mint

530
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,579
Jelly Bean you know top sellers for some

531
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,139
people against their full season because

532
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:00,000
and a lot of times it's because they're

533
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,380
in an area where it was way more

534
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,940
appropriate for them to grow in

535
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,919
autoflowers yeah because it's finished

536
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,660
because if you're in like New York

537
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,220
Massachusetts Maine you're full season

538
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,919
stuff sometimes it's going to get beat

539
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,720
up a little bit in those late storms so

540
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,000
having autoflowers that perform like

541
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,120
photoperiodic cousin they're Proto

542
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,099
cousins that's a game changer kind of

543
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:23,038
area

544
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:24,839
oh yeah no no question that there just

545
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,000
has to be the ability for people to to

546
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,519
do this in a in a way that lets them

547
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,720
enjoy it but the thing is it's it was a

548
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,279
question of like I had you know I was

549
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,400
pondering this what the fuck's up with

550
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:38,399
d8 and why are you having such an

551
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,460
availability of derivatives of uh

552
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,600
analogs and how the DEA and the FDA is

553
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,980
so cool with it I'm like man they're

554
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,298
crawling up our ass everything we do

555
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,440
forever but when it comes to these

556
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:48,839
things and you take a look and it's

557
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,179
really who owns the hemp Fields who

558
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,798
really controls the derivative Market of

559
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:55,080
these products and it's other larger

560
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,298
entities that are in Pharmaceutical

561
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,279
and so no that would never happen never

562
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:00,538
happened but when I when when you're

563
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,418
when you're looking at it from that

564
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:05,700
perspective which is honest you you

565
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:08,460
realize that you know for so much of the

566
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,100
stuff that we do with THC based cannabis

567
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,740
where you know it's we call it cannabis

568
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:15,240
it it's so highly regulated that it

569
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,400
makes it almost impossible for

570
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,620
mainstream to touch it in a way that's

571
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,419
convenient and for reason and we have a

572
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:23,038
lot of research to be done yeah but but

573
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,440
no convenience for the consumer like the

574
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,419
regular smoker someone who just wants to

575
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,460
be able like what I would call like the

576
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:31,259
the regular craft beer consumer they

577
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,240
probably drink maybe a six every week

578
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:34,740
once every two weeks they have a beer

579
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,700
every couple days when they they're just

580
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,259
like you know what I just want to have a

581
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,720
drink and chill and I'm good and then

582
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:41,160
you got guys who drink a six a day same

583
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,079
thing with weed you know you burn a

584
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,820
joint I burn I probably burn like I

585
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:46,500
guarantee I burn every night when I when

586
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:48,960
I when I sit down at the end of the day

587
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,579
and I almost know I always burn sometime

588
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,340
like around lunch

589
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:54,359
and if I'm doing some zooms I'm burning

590
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:57,058
one of them on the zooms because the

591
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,199
fucking zooms wear you out they're not

592
00:20:57,058 --> 00:20:59,879
smoking then all of a sudden you can

593
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,160
smoke yeah but but mostly you know two

594
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,360
three times a day I consume and I used

595
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,058
to consume I figured on the average

596
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,038
about 18 times a day so like for most of

597
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:09,599
my you know Youth and career I had a

598
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:12,119
joint in my mouth

599
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,500
full time there was never not a joint

600
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,239
fucking I was you know almost like chain

601
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,700
smoking where I was constantly lit up

602
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,259
and I think the stress was so high that

603
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,120
I didn't really realize that I just

604
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:24,419
found that this much cannabis use would

605
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,918
allow me to maintain like normality when

606
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,538
you run away otherwise unhealthy

607
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,640
lifestyle yeah because you're running a

608
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:32,038
wild life you know and pushing it to the

609
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,780
max yeah and and when you realize what

610
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:35,700
you're doing sometimes it freaks you out

611
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:36,720
and then you have like wait a minute a

612
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,279
lot of people don't realize that I know

613
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,720
the industry is like back in the day

614
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:41,759
there was this underlying level this

615
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,620
like constant stress well you're looking

616
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,140
at the helicopters flying today is there

617
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:48,119
a roadblock on the road for the consumer

618
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,799
the consumer having to stash the lead in

619
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:54,779
their drawers state troopers

620
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:57,058
I'd be driving from Boston down to Rhode

621
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:59,399
Island with pounds in the back with like

622
00:21:57,058 --> 00:22:02,819
a Mass state trooper pulling behind me

623
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,460
for like five miles I'm going like 40

624
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:07,678
miles an hour in the right hand lane

625
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,120
just like fuck and you know that and

626
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,798
that's just real but it did it created a

627
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,239
stress level but I think that what I did

628
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,839
is I used to stress level across the

629
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,339
industry I use cannabis as as a a

630
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:19,139
nullifier of it so that it allowed me to

631
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:20,879
function at

632
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,620
because I couldn't ever even like when

633
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,299
we first started like the nursery there

634
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:26,339
was no medical Protections in place and

635
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:28,558
I had like 30 40 000 plants in the

636
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:31,678
building at a time in fucking public

637
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,418
it all they had to do was get the FED to

638
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,038
come visit me and I was looking at four

639
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,179
life sentences right like they were

640
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,359
reading about that being like what is

641
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:41,159
that what are they doing man I got you

642
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,178
exactly what I was doing right I've

643
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,419
never read at the time being like that

644
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:48,419
is so bad what I was doing but I

645
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:49,860
I had to be able to have such faith in

646
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:53,100
myself

647
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:55,019
that everyone around you had faith and

648
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:57,779
the only way to really maintain that

649
00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:00,000
constant was to stay that Lit because I

650
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:01,740
was waiting I was way before oh fucking

651
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,359
hey like there was this there's levels

652
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,700
to this shit and I'm like oh no I went

653
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:08,219
all the way right and

654
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,720
but the thing is the team around you the

655
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,298
reason why they follow you the reason

656
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,860
why that you you get buy-in is because

657
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:15,000
people trust you because historically

658
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,279
you've able to you've been able to

659
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,659
navigate them through the dope game and

660
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,759
the people around you all made money

661
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:22,860
they all stayed safe they all made

662
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,419
benefit and they trusted you to figure

663
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,699
out what to do

664
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,940
and so when you know you get into these

665
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:32,279
levels of really responsible situations

666
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,019
that's why I fucking frown on half these

667
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:36,418
but most of these the new you know

668
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:38,460
modern CEO of cannabis is that

669
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:39,900
oh Jesus Christ man that I'm glad you

670
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,400
raised a lot of money but you fucked all

671
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,538
your investors and you shit on everybody

672
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,798
in your company

673
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:48,058
so like I got a code problems yeah you

674
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,000
got a fucking drug problem you got you

675
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:52,740
got fucking you got issues

676
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,480
to me I'm not like that's not what I'm

677
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,339
looking for you know and so what I what

678
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,679
I knew was that if I was bold enough to

679
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:00,779
do what I was going to do I had to make

680
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:04,440
sure that the people around me never

681
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:06,599
lost belief that I fucking believed

682
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,220
that there was never a moment you fucked

683
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,199
with me that you didn't think that I

684
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,360
didn't believe that I could pull it off

685
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,400
because I know that that's and I learned

686
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:15,839
that in the military right that when you

687
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,460
want to get people to do really hard

688
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,980
things

689
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,079
you can either create shame

690
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,659
or passion

691
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,460
and shame I don't like but passion I'm

692
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,960
about and I know that the way you get

693
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,220
someone to come out of a helicopter is

694
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,038
you go first

695
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,220
and if you go first they go fucking me

696
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:38,339
I'll follow you're behind them

697
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:40,880
and so what I what I what I what I did

698
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:42,959
was the same thing and and I think that

699
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,360
that it

700
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,000
it changes how you see the you know the

701
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,038
world because of it but at the same time

702
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,359
it doesn't mean anything to the people

703
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:52,919
that are here today and they don't

704
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,379
really have to appreciate it because it

705
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:56,880
was choices me we made but what I want

706
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,220
to see is I want to see that that

707
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,440
struggle resulted in a benefit for

708
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,480
people so that they were able to be able

709
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,700
to use Herb in a way that was positive

710
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,099
for them and it allowed more

711
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:12,000
I know that I'm only so limited I'm I'm

712
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:14,219
just me but when it's us it's we and

713
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,019
that means that one of you in the room

714
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,220
is going to bring an idea forward that I

715
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:19,379
never could

716
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,839
and so the only way you can continuously

717
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,280
create is to have continuous new ideas

718
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,759
and the only way that can really take

719
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:30,298
place is through Community participation

720
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,919
and my my desire all this all this time

721
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:33,359
as I got older was like I just can't

722
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,820
wait to see what's going to happen and I

723
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,558
hope people Crack the Code yeah what's

724
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:39,480
going to happen next is like the coolest

725
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:40,678
thing don't be a fucking hater you're

726
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,819
looking into the canvas you know it's

727
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,100
like

728
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:45,359
nothing that's totally blown apart as

729
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:46,740
far as like quality for me now it's just

730
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,359
like what's next there's stuff in here

731
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,159
like there's molecules that we're like

732
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:51,359
it seems like we're manifesting them out

733
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,120
of there there's like making shit up

734
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:56,459
where was this coming out of here

735
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:58,798
so Potter Valley so we had some Potter

736
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,778
Valley some Michigan

737
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,220
um I'm not sure I I grew that one in

738
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:04,019
Humboldt I'm not sure what the other one

739
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,200
but the but the genetic work was all

740
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:09,740
done in Washington so like that's not a

741
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,840
bad Community you know you got all these

742
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,460
together and what we have is directions

743
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:17,579
and nothing's better than the other

744
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:20,579
they're all super unique shots as long

745
