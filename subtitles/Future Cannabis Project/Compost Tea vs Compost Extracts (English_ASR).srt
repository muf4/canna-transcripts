1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,460
Scot you had a post where you were

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,949
talking about extracts are you moving

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,410
more towards extracts versus compost

4
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:15,599
teas and then can you talk a little bit

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,800
about extracts versus cheese and kind of

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,500
for sure your mindset for sure so I

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,210
think really you know kind of a

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,399
confusion that's happened is you know

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,380
there's dr. Laningham who's who came up

10
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,089
with all these methods and you know

11
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,039
she's kind of known for saying tea

12
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:35,399
saying tea saying tea compost tea

13
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:39,420
compost tea compost tea and what happens

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,950
is people then go just do any version of

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:46,530
what they define as tea so there's a

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,780
extreme variation between what dr.

17
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,969
Elaine Ingham defines as compost tea and

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,049
what the market does across the board I

19
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:58,350
can't think of anything that's more

20
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:01,378
varied in any thing I've ever done in my

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,618
entire life and so the two major

22
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:05,938
obstacles with compost tea is you're

23
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,700
doing you're doing animal husbandry

24
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:12,688
you're growing animals and you're

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,760
growing life in a tank and and you

26
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:17,219
either are not quantifying those

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,159
organisms most of the people that

28
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:24,390
possess a microscope just kind of look

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,250
through which isn't bad but there's a

30
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,099
lot that you can't see if you're just

31
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,739
looking through in the early years there

32
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:34,078
was a lot of really bad information as

33
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,688
far as organism identification so I feel

34
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,819
like an entire community went chasing

35
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:41,489
after the wrong goal because of a couple

36
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:43,319
key people I think that's starting to

37
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,149
get sorted out a little bit now that dr.

38
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,239
laning hims courses are far more

39
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:53,149
accessible but essentially what we ran

40
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:56,908
into in the work place is you know

41
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:59,728
really the first few jobs I got were to

42
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,140
teach people how to brew tea and what

43
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:03,659
that would look like is I would go to

44
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,670
the facility we would set up a recipe I

45
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,039
would verify with the microscope that it

46
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,959
was what it needed to be and then we

47
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,579
would replicate it over multiple days so

48
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,180
I could leave them with a compost tea

49
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,860
recipe

50
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,870
through that first year it became really

51
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,640
apparent the problems with that because

52
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,408
what ends up happening is the climate

53
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,199
changes the temperature changes the

54
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:25,449
conditions change for that life and I

55
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,389
don't think you know the market wide

56
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:30,908
really understands how varied those

57
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:33,789
results if compost tea brewing can be

58
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:35,500
and when we start to communicate to

59
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:37,929
people these obstacles and we say you

60
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,680
need to be checking and and it kind of

61
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:44,049
turns into this like class warfare

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,909
emotions like people get offended like

63
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,609
I'm saying you're not qualified to do

64
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:51,310
this but I mean technically that's

65
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:53,349
what's happening and and if you want to

66
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,060
brew tea you should become proficient in

67
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:57,039
identifying organisms to actually

68
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,658
quantify them because you're either

69
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,628
brewing life or you're either brewing

70
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:03,250
disease and we went from facility to

71
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:06,310
facility in facility and we just kept

72
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:09,549
tracking the issues with people brewing

73
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,969
tea around that same time like from like

74
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:14,980
2014 to 2016 I think dr. Alaine really

75
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:19,539
started switching more to the extract

76
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:21,729
model and so the benefits of tea is you

77
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:24,068
excite organisms and they produce glues

78
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:25,689
and they stick to surfaces that's great

79
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:27,429
if you're covering leaves if you're

80
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:29,198
trying to penetrate to roots they never

81
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,709
get to the roots they stick to the soil

82
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,639
surface

83
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:36,219
so dr. Alaine was seeing a benefit to

84
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,949
adding compost extract to the soil

85
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:40,840
versus compost tea because it the

86
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:42,940
compost extract you're dislodging

87
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,739
organisms into water and then those

88
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:47,348
organisms will travel as far as the

89
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:50,560
water does and so you actually get to

90
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:53,888
the desired result quicker using a

91
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,719
compost extract versus a compost tea now

92
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:59,199
the downside of the compost extract is

93
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:02,109
you use more compost but the upside is

94
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,849
there's almost no volatility there's

95
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:05,769
almost no detriment that could come with

96
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:08,798
it as long as your compost doesn't have

97
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:10,719
detrimental aspects to it and so at the

98
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,519
small scale you can brew some compost

99
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,769
tea but as we started to get bigger and

100
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,739
bigger and bigger we ran into remarkable

101
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:19,720
obstacles at scale I don't necessarily

102
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:22,299
say this publicly because then I get

103
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,820
nasty emails and things from people that

104
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,170
manufacture tea equipment but the larger

105
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:28,990
the tank you go the worst

106
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,000
gets the last thing that you want my

107
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,040
opinion is a 500 thousand gallon tea

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,459
brew I apologize the people but that's

109
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,990
the math of it and so there's a lot of

110
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,669
obstacles to brewing tea because you're

111
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,970
trying to do it on a time line like

112
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:45,280
you're trying to you're trying to

113
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,690
reproduce rabbits on a perfect time

114
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,369
scale that fits into the commercial

115
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:50,980
space and it doesn't work it doesn't

116
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,439
work and so if you start a tea brew that

117
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,509
has a 24 hour life cycle and you come in

118
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,939
next morning but then you doesn't you

119
00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:00,219
discover an irrigation leak and you get

120
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:01,509
occupied for four hours well now that

121
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,640
tea that may have would have been

122
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:06,159
healthy is now full of disease and

123
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,039
problematic and then you put that on to

124
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,150
your plants so there's a lot of issues

125
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,730
with tea at scale compost extract is far

126
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:17,379
lower volatility again we start moving

127
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,180
up in scale we're not working with

128
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:21,310
technically trained people we're working

129
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:25,780
with agricultural employees sometimes

130
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:28,839
and so it's far easier to explain to a

131
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:30,939
non non trained employee how to do a

132
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:32,979
compost extract I thought the

133
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:35,469
fascinating part that you guys discover

134
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,990
was the difference in high elevation and

135
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,910
low elevation lack of oxygen and those

136
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,550
chemical nightmare yes a total nightmare

137
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,890
and that you know like I said 2015-2016

138
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,199
that was really the first jobs we got

139
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:48,939
was teaching people how to brew tea

140
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,349
because that's really all they knew from

141
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,910
dr. Alaine they knew that we were

142
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,410
involved dr. Alaine they wanted to get

143
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,580
in and so now what my wife and I do is

144
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,189
you know we show up with a couple

145
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:04,629
55-gallon drums and a pump and a sump

146
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:06,459
pump and 130 foot hose and I mean you

147
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,069
know the wife and I can apply compost

148
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:12,579
extract a 30,000 square feet and a

149
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:14,649
workday yeah we just we just edits and

150
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:16,810
it's no volatility it cleans out you can

151
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:19,599
rinse out the thing because what we also

152
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,910
started working what running into is you

153
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,740
run into OSHA now if you're trying to do

154
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,110
a regulated facility you got an OSHA

155
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,389
person making sure you conform you

156
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,300
cannot have an employee climb up on a

157
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:34,209
ladder to get into a 250-gallon tank and

158
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,770
a regulated facility and it's just not

159
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:37,029
gonna fly and so now you got to build a

160
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:39,250
platform and then just you're

161
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,799
multiplying problems to do something

162
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,800
that we don't know

163
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:47,210
sorry advocate and you know for for

164
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,788
Sarah and I the real like profound aha

165
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:51,348
moment that will by far go down as one

166
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:54,079
of the most profound experiences I've

167
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:55,848
had in many workplaces we were trying to

168
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,740
brew tea at a facility that hired us to

169
00:06:55,848 --> 00:07:00,829
treat two that were about fifteen miles

170
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:04,478
apart and we were racing back and forth

171
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:06,918
to set tea brews at both facilities and

172
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,779
we came to the one facility was getting

173
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:10,810
dark it was outside we're running out of

174
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:14,179
time and at that time we were using like

175
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,889
200 300 gallon tanks we'd put compost

176
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,168
tea bags in there we'd aerate it for

177
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:19,699
20-30 minutes we'd swap them out we do

178
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:22,668
that a couple times until we hit the

179
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:24,949
targeted values and we just didn't have

180
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:27,529
enough time to do that and so Sarah was

181
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:29,330
like well I'll just hand to extract the

182
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,899
amount of compost into a five-gallon

183
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:31,519
bucket

184
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:33,079
we'll pour it into the top of the tea

185
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:37,339
brew and top it off and go home and get

186
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:40,250
dinner and the funny part about it was

187
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:42,198
she did it faster than me and she got

188
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,288
better extraction rates because the hand

189
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,949
extraction rate was more efficient than

190
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:51,500
the aerated in the 300 gallon tank and

191
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:53,569
that we haven't looked back since people

192
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,000
don't want to hear it they're not

193
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:57,500
impressed by that we there's a lot of

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,218
jobs that don't hire us because they

195
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,959
want these Wizardry tea brews but you

196
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:05,028
know proofs in the pudding we haven't

197
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,829
turned back cents you know and it's far

198
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:10,038
easier for me to show up to a facility

199
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:11,959
with two blue barrels blessed out the

200
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:14,870
extract wash it out turn it upside down

201
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:17,000
and get in and you know that's you know

202
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,649
previously I used to advocate like

203
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,329
55-gallon Brewers and we were using

204
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:22,339
these stainless steel ones and we'd have

205
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:24,769
our facilities get them ya know I'm a

206
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:27,948
big that you remember when it fell on

207
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:30,769
the employee yeah so that tank fell on

208
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:33,139
one of the employees because she saw me

209
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:34,968
and I I would always try to be really

210
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:37,370
careful to not fill it up with water and

211
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:39,260
move it but I screwed up and I needed it

212
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,969
to go like 30 feet to the left

213
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:42,948
and I'd already filled it up and I was

214
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:46,760
just kind of in today tired stressed and

215
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:48,889
so I picked I was kind of dragging this

216
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,549
tank down this concrete thing to the

217
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:50,919
next row

218
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:52,639
well the non-english-speaking

219
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:53,778
agricultural employee that had to

220
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,208
execute that task

221
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:58,399
after I left did that same bang and she

222
00:08:56,208 --> 00:09:01,039
pulled a 55-gallon stainless steel

223
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,470
Brewer on top of her and that was the

224
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:07,188
end of that game I was like that's not

225
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:09,019
going down at all and so you know a lot

226
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:10,759
of these workplace scenarios of

227
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:12,948
practicality like I think that's where

228
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,360
Eric and I really are very similar in

229
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:18,469
that we always want to find the most

230
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,850
practical low-cost easy solution and you

231
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,290
know people that make and sell Brewers

232
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,970
don't want to hear it people that want

233
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:25,009
to buy Brewers don't want to hear it but

234
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:28,278
I'm telling you we get remarkable

235
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:30,470
results using small barrels and the most

236
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:33,379
employees want to clock in and clock out

237
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,540
it's you know as much as everybody who

238
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:38,600
wants to be in cannabis and wants that

239
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:40,519
job in it or whatever it a lot of people

240
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,439
turn it into the clock in and clock out

241
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:47,870
and if you don't make it easy and

242
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:51,078
somewhat desirable it just becomes you

243
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,970
know it becomes the next guys job and

244
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:55,818
the new guy and the next and it just

245
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,379
moves on and so a lot of these jobs now

246
00:09:55,818 --> 00:09:59,958
we're not saying everything is easy

247
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:01,759
there's work involved but you have to

248
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:04,219
make it safe first of all and if it's

249
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,019
not safe that's an issue and secondly if

250
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,959
it's not something that people are like

251
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:11,480
feeling passionate about it drives down

252
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:14,328
morale as you're working with a big team

253
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,629
of people and it all it takes is one

254
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:20,778
you know seedling or one you know cell

255
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:22,850
to start to have that you know

256
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:24,620
uninspired attitude and it drags the

257
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,360
whole bunch down and a lot of these

258
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,639
corporate facilities don't give a fuck

259
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,278
about you know they're not there to make

260
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,930
friends and you can they see that shit

261
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,629
and you're gone quick so I mean at the

262
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:38,178
end of the day you know making these

263
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:40,129
facilities smooth and enticing for

264
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:42,259
employees is important because again

265
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:44,928
once you start getting to that clock in

266
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:47,509
clock out passion drives down and we're

267
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:49,100
not actually leveling the point well

268
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:51,169
what what happened what kind of evolved

269
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,058
us to the barrels is we were working on

270
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:56,269
a large AG project we don't just do

271
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:58,669
cannabis we do anything and we did a

272
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:03,289
farm that was 6,000 acres of corn and

273
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:06,289
soy and we had like six 250 gallon tea

274
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:07,849
brewers that were in IBC totes which

275
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:09,259
kind of solves a problem of scale but I

276
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,819
have objections to as well but

277
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:13,879
nonetheless we were running those and so

278
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:15,828
Sarah and I developed the SOP and and

279
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,360
determine how many minutes how much

280
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:19,698
compost how much time

281
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,500
what process yields the appropriate

282
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:24,438
result and then we turn that over to

283
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,480
employees and as soon as the employees

284
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:28,639
take over that job we start having

285
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,678
problems with the numbers on the extract

286
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,808
we start getting undesirable aspects to

287
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:35,028
it the quality goes down because they're

288
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:36,528
not able to clean it they're not super

289
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,419
motivated to climb in that thing and

290
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:40,938
scrub it like we do so you start to lose

291
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:43,969
repeatability and so that's really where

292
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:46,969
the 55-gallon barrel excels is that its

293
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,949
small its compact it's consistent it

294
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,079
keeps it even it keeps it in small

295
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:53,899
enough batches to go from space to pace

296
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:56,058
to space and and it's repeatable and

297
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,159
it's easy to clean out and we see this

298
00:11:56,058 --> 00:12:00,558
in other areas like Frenchie cannoli

299
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:04,039
doesn't make hash in a 400 gallon barrel

300
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:05,688
he makes it in the same damn size that

301
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,909
the little washing machines are because

302
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:10,519
you get better extraction rates and you

303
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:12,289
get more consistency and so we just

304
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,389
tried to replicate that model and like

305
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:17,509
eric says is produce a standard

306
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:20,048
operating procedure that's not painful

307
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:23,329
to an employee that doesn't add undo

308
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:26,688
process or headache or reasons to get

309
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:28,638
yelled at or any of that thing and the

310
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:30,740
55-gallon drums solves all those

311
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,808
problems it keeps the extract into a

312
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,778
small container so you don't magnify

313
00:12:32,808 --> 00:12:37,698
variation you get really consistent

314
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:39,980
dispensing of organisms across the

315
00:12:37,698 --> 00:12:41,958
property from corner to corner and most

316
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,579
employees can rinse it out with a hose

317
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:47,028
turn it upside down and clean it

318
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:49,489
properly which is the actual goal and

319
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:51,470
that is one of the major components

320
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,110
that's missing from the commercially

321
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,600
produced tea brewers that is becoming

322
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,240
very apparent in the regulated market

323
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,659
and we've worked with some facilities in

324
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,028
Vegas which has a remarkably difficult

325
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:07,519
microbial things to navigate and we

326
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:10,909
tracked several facilities over the

327
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,009
course of a year and saw microbial

328
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:16,129
issues popping up with certain types of

329
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:18,438
tea Brewers and process and again you

330
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,620
know we moved away from a lot of types

331
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:22,230
of equipment

332
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,649
you know as unsexy it is and as

333
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,659
disappointing as it is we by far get the

334
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:32,879
best results using a couple blue barrels

335
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:35,549
and $100 pump from Home Depot but if you

336
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,429
listen to dr. Ingham so much a compost

337
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:40,469
heap was really designed to do the glue

338
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:42,059
binding was to bind the particles so

339
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,960
that you start to have the ability to

340
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:48,989
take soil that had inadequate

341
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:51,180
tilth and increase it and we started

342
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,799
using it as these inoculants and the

343
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:54,899
thing was that as you start to learn

344
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,490
you're you're not qualified on the

345
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:58,528
microscope so you have no idea what

346
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,500
you're brewing and you end up seeing

347
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:04,139
pathogenic problems resulting from your

348
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,289
work because you're kind of using voodoo

349
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:09,449
science and I think the compost extract

350
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:11,370
is excellent because it's you're able to

351
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,910
take what you want to take and put it in

352
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:17,429
but I think the compost tea designed for

353
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:19,949
you know building ground that isn't

354
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:22,559
ready for cultivation and preparing it

355
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,120
laying the cover crops in binding the

356
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,219
soil gluing it together

357
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,070
I think that's the purpose of it more

358
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,528
than where the way we use it sure no

359
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,420
because I was I was a brewer too and I

360
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:36,330
got to a size in blue tank where I was

361
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:38,129
probably like 250 but it got to the size

362
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,990
where it was I gotta climb up in the

363
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:42,870
damn thing to clean it it becomes a

364
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:46,169
nightmare you can't flip it it starts to

365
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:48,389
become too big to service yeah and I

366
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:50,099
didn't want a centralized monster tank

367
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:51,600
to feed through because I'm like you

368
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,730
start leaving residue in the lines

369
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,769
you're starting to have pathogenic

370
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,220
contamination because it has to be clean

371
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:00,569
and you start to realize you're doing

372
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,190
the same thing you're starting in a

373
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:05,640
closet and you're trying to multiply it

374
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:08,339
out to acreage yeah and yeah and and

375
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,429
also too it's a it you know what we do

376
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:14,670
now is also a you know millions of

377
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:17,219
square feet of evolution and compost tea

378
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:18,899
is a remarkably powerful tool you know

379
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,180
one of our counterparts Nick Thomas

380
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:24,088
Eenie goes by humankind Oregon he uses a

381
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:26,189
lot of compost tea and you know if you

382
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,650
properly brew tea and you get it onto

383
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,110
the plants I mean next morning there's a

384
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:32,970
new branch it's some wild apple I mean

385
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,519
if you do it right and you hit the nut

386
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,160
that dr. Lane defines its pure

387
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,039
witchcraft but a lot of times the

388
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,469
compost tea is a fourth-quarter decision

389
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,509
not the way Nick uses it but like to

390
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,610
combat disease or whatever so you're

391
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:49,050
throwing a Hail Mary at fourth quarter

392
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,419
and you know what my wife and I have

393
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:53,878
done if Don was like how do we circle

394
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:55,649
back to the very beginning to circumvent

395
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:58,438
problems to not need a fourth quarter

396
00:15:55,649 --> 00:16:01,470
decision and that strategy is getting

397
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:04,078
back to a compost extract starting at

398
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:05,939
the beginning starting with organisms

399
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,669
that are distributed evenly from corner

400
00:16:05,938 --> 00:16:11,399
to corner start with a tank that doesn't

401
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:13,698
also bring disease and then monitor that

402
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,919
process effectively and appropriately so

403
00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:19,289
you know you can't you can avoid there

404
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:21,599
excuse me you can take a compost tea and

405
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:23,188
you can knock out powdery mildew we've

406
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,230
done it before we used to do it back in

407
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:26,909
the earlier years but it was just it was

408
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,159
too complicated as a business strategy

409
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:30,990
so we stopped doing it but you can come

410
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,600
up to a facility and stop a whole bunch

411
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:37,110
of nightmares with a really good tea but

412
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:40,019
we can also go back to propagation start

413
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:42,120
fresh start with a good extract use the

414
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:44,399
microscope to quantify your trajectory

415
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,860
as you go from start to finish and you

416
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,139
can avoid getting mold by making

417
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,300
watering changes by making feed changes

418
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,240
by you know in a lot of cases making

419
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:57,028
environmental changes mm-hmm so we you

420
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,028
know what came with regulation for us is

421
00:16:57,028 --> 00:17:01,860
you know prior and in the black markets

422
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:03,568
it was a by all means necessary approach

423
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,548
you could spray Michael butanol in the

424
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:08,009
last week if you really felt like that's

425
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:10,019
what you were going to do and because we

426
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:12,689
can't do these we have to get back to

427
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:15,389
the beginning of the root cause identify

428
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:18,860
what the actual issue is and avoid

429
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,860
hitting that island altogether
