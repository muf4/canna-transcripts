[Music]

2
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:19,229
we're going to invite Kevin de Leon up

3
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:21,660
to join us yes and we work his campaign

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:33,269
alright give it up for Kevin de Leon you

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:34,739
guys well very quickly let me introduce

6
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,180
myself to each and every one of you for

7
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,759
those who don't know me now I thank you

8
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,590
very much for allowing me to share a few

9
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,969
words with all of you here today an

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,570
incredible night here in Bennett's

11
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,820
California my name is Kevin de Leon and

12
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,380
I'm running to become your next US

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,020
Senator for the great state of

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,880
California and I believe strongly that

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,220
these are very dangerous consequential

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,130
times in our nation's history that we're

17
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,159
in fact engaged in the battle for the

18
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:05,189
soul for this nation against a president

19
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:09,060
without one now the issue of cannabis

20
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:11,158
and why this is so important and why we

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,049
should have a voice in Washington DC is

22
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,299
because the current incumbent that I'm

23
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,920
running it against doesn't even support

24
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:22,109
the use of cannabis for medicinal uses

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,399
now think about this wherever your

26
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:24,809
perspective may be on the issue of

27
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:27,629
cannabis and I know where all of your

28
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,969
perspectives are on cannabis but society

29
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:36,239
as a whole now if you don't support at

30
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:38,968
minimum the use of cannabis for

31
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,739
medicinal purposes when we have

32
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:43,649
scientific empirical evidence with

33
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:46,828
regards to people who have AIDS people

34
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,349
who have Alzheimers a Parkinson's some

35
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:50,968
form of cancer breast cancer ovarian

36
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:54,349
cancer whatever type of cancer whatever

37
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:58,858
variation to help alleviate pain

38
00:01:54,349 --> 00:02:02,278
suffering if you don't support that with

39
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:04,618
scientific evidence then I don't believe

40
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:07,590
you should be a voice of a state like

41
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:11,209
California that is diverse like no other

42
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,209
state in the entire world

43
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:18,459
so I am a supporter of the medicinal use

44
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,649
of cannabis as well as the recreational

45
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:24,269
use of cannabis and we have an

46
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:27,250
incredible opportunity to make sure that

47
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,920
cannabis industry becomes a strong green

48
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,539
pillar of our economy today we're the

49
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,188
fifth largest economy in the world and

50
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:34,900
to put this in context there are only

51
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:36,810
four economies larger than that of ours

52
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,900
the United States of America as a whole

53
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,519
China Japan Germany then your great

54
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,319
state our great state the state of

55
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,760
California and if you're remotely

56
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,068
interested in rounding up the top ten

57
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,679
that number six is United Kingdom seven

58
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:53,138
it is France then we have Italy India

59
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,560
and that number 10 it is Vladimir

60
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:58,989
Putin's Russia so to put this in context

61
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,719
California's GDP is larger than that of

62
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:04,239
Vladimir Putin's Russia and I am a

63
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:05,949
strong proponent of clean energy I am

64
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,870
the author of the most far-reaching

65
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:10,018
climate change policy in the United

66
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,430
States America 100% clean energy

67
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:16,150
California is the largest economy in the

68
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:19,000
world to legally mandate 100% clean

69
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,379
energy by the year 2045 I'm a strong

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,900
supporter of clean energy because we

71
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:24,098
have an incredible opportunity to

72
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,949
convert these environmental challenges

73
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:28,869
into real economic opportunities

74
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:31,629
especially giving those at the lowest

75
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:34,359
economic strata those men and women of

76
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:36,039
color real opportunities to succeed in a

77
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:38,290
clean energy space energy efficiency

78
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:40,568
renewable energy wind solar another

79
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:41,709
clean energy technologies Huell that

80
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:43,478
will be invented in the future

81
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,389
transportation electrification Zeb's

82
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:49,269
zero emissions vehicles so a green

83
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:51,849
economy is our future but a green

84
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,789
economy what cannabis is our future -

85
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:57,098
and these are two twin pillars that can

86
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:59,978
really drive California's economy well

87
00:03:57,098 --> 00:04:02,589
into the future that's why having a

88
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:04,750
voice in Washington DC and being a

89
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,348
leader nationwide for cannabis is

90
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:10,299
absolutely important now when we pass

91
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:13,719
medicinal use of cannabis we thought

92
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:15,189
that that would open up the doors but it

93
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,988
really didn't because of all the

94
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:20,108
litigation because local governments

95
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:22,718
because of cultural prejudices with

96
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:24,609
regards to cannabis but that's why we

97
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:27,529
have a Department of Justice that's hast

98
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,569
to the legal establishment of cannabis

99
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:31,699
not just in California but throughout

100
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,620
the country that's why we need a voice

101
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:40,189
in Washington DC that's gonna dese

102
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:44,990
Ketchel D scheduled cannabis because to

103
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:50,418
put cannabis on the same level of heroin

104
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:53,120
and cocaine is ludicrous and we have

105
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:55,099
seen the consequences of so many men and

106
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,850
women but particularly men and men of

107
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:01,669
color that have been incarcerated

108
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:03,760
because of this scheduling and we've

109
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:06,740
seen the devastation we've seen our

110
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,500
taxpayer dollars blow up budgets to

111
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,199
incarcerate so many individuals and

112
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,120
that's why we need a strong voice in

113
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,159
Washington DC that will fight the

114
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,899
Department of Justice the will fight the

115
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,970
prejudices that exist in the Congress

116
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:25,789
today we export 75% of cannabis to other

117
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:28,419
parts of the country so California will

118
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,340
be and can be and should be and will be

119
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:33,620
that economy for the entire nation

120
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:34,909
that's why I just want to thank you very

121
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,769
much for giving me an opportunity to

122
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,990
share a few words with with all of you

123
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:42,099
here today I want to say that we have a

124
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:44,478
real opportunity to grow this industry

125
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,110
but you need champions we're going to be

126
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:51,829
there with you

127
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:54,439
so can I thank you for being a champion

128
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:56,449
for our cause and and you know you

129
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,490
definitely have our votes I voted for

130
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:02,060
you I'm so excited that you're here

131
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:04,970
right now you know and we are we're in

132
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,500
the midst of a tsunami of regulations

133
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,950
that just changed on us at the moment

134
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:12,259
and we've been witnessing extinction

135
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:13,939
events with our our licensed operators

136
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,879
since January 1st we've been watching

137
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:18,740
extinction events with legacy operators

138
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,478
that were not able to get permits still

139
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,210
haven't been able to get permits and now

140
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:26,810
with the regulations continuing to cause

141
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:29,299
whiplash we're and we're in a we're in

142
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,129
an awkward state right now where we're

143
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,900
not sure which way we're going and and

144
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:35,360
even my the smartest people in the

145
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:37,389
industry can't figure it we can't come

146
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,160
to a consensus on what just changed

147
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:41,169
therefore we can't come to a consensus

148
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,020
on what solutions we need to employ what

149
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:48,490
to do yeah right and so really where

150
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:51,879
we're at is we're having a tremendously

151
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:55,210
challenging time regulating an

152
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:57,639
unregulated market and competing with an

153
00:06:55,209 --> 00:07:00,519
unregulated market and what it seems

154
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,669
like California did was they took models

155
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:05,199
from other states and tried to you know

156
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:07,180
copy/paste this section over here and

157
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,189
we'll do it like Colorado did it over

158
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,530
there recall Rob they did not take it to

159
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:13,509
account that we had a thriving black

160
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:15,459
market that produced 12 and a half

161
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:18,490
million pounds of cannabis prior to

162
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:20,439
legalization going into effect and so I

163
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,060
mean really like the number one issue

164
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,579
that we're discovering right now that is

165
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,699
blowing all of my smartest friends away

166
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:28,449
is that we have an inversion problem

167
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,000
everyone was so worried about a

168
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:33,039
diversion problem we have a significant

169
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,019
inversion problem because there's so

170
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,050
many legacy operators that can't get

171
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:39,909
oppor they get get permits and then you

172
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,100
know we wanted to be able to talk to you

173
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,689
about you know these challenges that

174
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,540
we're facing at the moment we have we

175
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:48,490
have eleven days right now left of a 15

176
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,080
day public comment period there were we

177
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,710
can't get consensus with the smartest

178
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:56,169
people on you know so take over Pamela

179
00:07:53,709 --> 00:08:00,219
the consensus is difficult because the

180
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:02,110
issues of fact operators at different a

181
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,660
pivot points right there's different

182
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,210
pressure points if you are a retailer

183
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,800
and you have multiple operations or if

184
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:11,529
you're vertically integrated or if

185
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,800
you're a tech platform what does a non

186
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:17,669
cannabis plant touching business look

187
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,960
like I think that those are the the real

188
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:23,620
quintessential issues and what does it

189
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:27,279
mean to be an owner what does it mean to

190
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:29,709
be a financial interest holder and as we

191
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:32,919
chart through these issues that we'll

192
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:34,960
talk about I think knowing as somebody

193
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,689
who is hopefully going to be

194
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,729
representing California's interest at

195
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,340
the federal level a lot of these issues

196
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:47,500
splinter down into how do we get access

197
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:49,810
to banking how do we go about forging a

198
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,278
path of uncertainty

199
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:54,219
through these regulations and I know

200
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:56,889
that if 280 for example weren't an issue

201
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:00,069
some of these other licensing white

202
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:02,230
labeling structuring issues would also

203
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:03,639
then evaporate so I think it's

204
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,159
interesting for us to start that

205
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:10,870
dialogue is what is the federal effect

206
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:12,188
of the state let me just add one thing

207
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,539
because you said something that was

208
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:16,149
really critical with the issue of

209
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:18,039
banking and how many folks put their

210
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:20,649
live set at a risk you know with so much

211
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:23,980
cash and we had the banking system here

212
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:29,308
that won't is prohibited legally

213
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:35,199
obviously from accepting legally gotten

214
00:09:29,308 --> 00:09:36,399
gains by our retailers just this Monday

215
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:38,740
I did a press conference with the

216
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,318
president of the City Council Los

217
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:44,829
Angeles Herb Wesson with regards to the

218
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:47,229
establishment of a public bank and what

219
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:53,498
it reasons is because the federal

220
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:56,170
regulations won't allow cannabis to be

221
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:59,230
part of officially the banking system

222
00:09:56,169 --> 00:10:01,539
that's why at the federal level I want

223
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,670
to be your voice to push this and I

224
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:06,159
think that there's a lot of cultural

225
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:09,308
prejudices obviously that primi eight

226
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:11,708
Washington DC on the issue of cannabis

227
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:14,198
we're so innovative we're so creative

228
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:15,969
we're disruptive of a state we just

229
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:17,828
don't push the envelope we in fact we

230
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,990
tear the animals apart and that's why

231
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:22,719
California is always so ahead of the

232
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:27,250
curve in many ways and that's why in

233
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,528
Washington DC it's always been archaic

234
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,230
it's just been behind the times and

235
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:34,899
that's why we have to have a voice in

236
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,879
Washington DC because what premie Eights

237
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:38,169
Washington you see all these cultural

238
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,420
prejudices that

239
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:42,938
remember the movie the old movie reefer

240
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:46,028
madness you know people truly think that

241
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:47,948
in Washington DC with regards to reefer

242
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:49,299
madness you know and that's so behind

243
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:51,428
the times and compares to what it's

244
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:53,229
happening bless you but that's what

245
00:10:51,428 --> 00:10:56,169
makes California such an incredible

246
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:58,149
place and on the banking issue is what I

247
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:01,328
want to work on as well too because that

248
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:02,190
will help legitimize if you will you

249
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:05,519
know and

250
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:08,040
cash flow price points with regards to

251
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,710
getting access to capital which right

252
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:13,289
now is very very complex if not almost

253
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,480
impossible right now so that's just a

254
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:22,110
little you know with regards to the

255
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:24,690
banking issue so something that I love

256
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,450
seen and individuals lives because I'm

257
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,360
all about self enrichment is seeing

258
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:32,100
people that have a full circle moment

259
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,139
I've actually had a very much a full

260
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,330
circle moment tonight as about two and a

261
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:40,889
half three years ago I was in Washington

262
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:43,560
DC at our capital lobbying for cannabis

263
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:45,720
rights and I actually spoke with our

264
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,089
California senators office at the time

265
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,009
that you're running against and the

266
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:55,560
chief of staff and the assistant chief

267
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:58,830
of staff were very non-responsive or or

268
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:01,199
combative with the group from Americans

269
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:03,990
for safe access and at the end of it I

270
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,450
told the chief of staff I look forward

271
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,159
to the day that I get to vote for the

272
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,980
person that will be replacing you

273
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,439
because this is California and we

274
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,019
support cannabis here and if our

275
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,960
representatives don't stand behind what

276
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:22,079
we believe in then it is time for you to

277
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:28,200
go so I am personally very honored

278
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:29,460

285
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,439
happened long that stock went down real

286
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:52,539
fast you know I thought it'd go up

287
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,770
actually you know but let me say this

288
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:56,839
again thank you very much for BA to my

289
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:59,269
heart for forgiving me a few moments and

290
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:04,610
I'm sorry that if I disrupted a little

291
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:09,379
bit but my campaign is a disruptive

292
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:12,080
campaign and listen if I would never

293
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:13,220
have been a state senator know what I

294
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,310
have ever been the leader the president

295
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:19,009
of our California State Senate if I had

296
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:21,469
listened to folks say no when it is your

297
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:23,929
time and know your place in many ways

298
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,639
we're all disruptive and that's who we

299
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:28,969
are because that's that creative spirit

300
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:32,509
that's restless and precisely what you

301
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,610
said is it this is about values and it's

302
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:36,740
our values and that's why it's time that

303
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:39,409
we export California values to

304
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,879
Washington not the other way round and

305
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:43,759
we don't have to accept the status quo

306
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:46,909
the naysayers it's always we can't do

307
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,230
this we can't do that well we can't deal

308
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,539
with the issue banking because it

309
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,610
doesn't a lot the law doesn't allow you

310
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:55,250
know for banking for the cannabis

311
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,560
industry well why not let's change that

312
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,120
and let's disrupt the status quo that's

313
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,609
how you make laws and that's how you

314
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,379
make change in this country and that's

315
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,330
why we're the fifth largest economy in

316
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:07,490
the world and that's why we need to deal

317
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:10,550
with the issue of this cannabis industry

318
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,710
and make it a very legitimate industry

319
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:15,229
like clean energy like any other

320
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:17,150
industry you guys are on the cusp you

321
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,190
are in the vanguard you are the

322
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:22,340
progressive wing of this new industry

323
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,590
that is a legitimate industry and will

324
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,420
be sooner or later recognized by the

325
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,280
federal authorities but in order for

326
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:30,949
that to happen you have to be involved

327
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:34,339
in politics because if you're not

328
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:36,530
involved in politics politics is gonna

329
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,590
get involved with you whether you like

330
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:41,360
it or not in this case politics is

331
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,879
getting a ball with you and you're not

332
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,990
liking it so what you're gonna do you're

333
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,389
gonna cross your arms

334
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:49,730
and say well that's the way it is well

335
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:52,210
no you're gonna fight for what you

336
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,680
believe is right that's who we are as

337
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:56,960
Californians and that's why I'm asking

338
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:59,870
you come November 6 less than two weeks

339
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,370
from now don't forget to vote tell your

340
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,340
friends your neighbors your loved ones

341
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:07,460
your co-workers your workers for the

342
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:10,160
next 2 minutes I want you to listen to

343
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:13,250
the 3 other people on stage with you

344
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:17,389
and I want each of you to give Kevin one

345
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:20,690
thing cannabis-related that if he wins

346
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:26,929
you would like him to think about as he

347
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:28,490
settles into Washington if you choose

348
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:32,409
banking I'm choosing law enforcement

349
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,409
which one you going I only get one I

350
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:39,469
want I want retraining for law

351
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:40,759
enforcement they don't know what they

352
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,580
don't know the difference between a

353
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:48,049
licensed operator and an unlicensed one

354
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:50,000
and we're having a really hard time even

355
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:53,539
calling them for support when a licensed

356
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,190
operator is getting robbed for them to

357
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:56,740
care and then I care about our licensed

358
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,820
weed they're not going to go find it

359
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,259
this is happening in a lot of

360
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,690
jurisdictions at the moment so that's

361
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:05,480
sort of you know but if we had banking

362
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,980
the that that's my number one thing but

363
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,330
I'm pretty sure that Pamela was gonna go

364
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:14,990
with that one yeah we banking retraining

365
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:19,100
for law enforcement and and to that note

366
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:21,289
though as a person who fights for people

367
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,330
dealing with disabilities as I was an

368
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:24,679
individual on disability myself for

369
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,160
several years while I went back to

370
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:31,339
college due to my epilepsy is police

371
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,100
force it's not just cannabis it's every

372
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:36,170
area that you're an outlier that if

373
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,730
you're outside of the norm they need

374
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:39,740
training but I'm not gonna take that one

375
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,610
what I'm going to take is maybe a little

376
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:46,399
bit grander is that I would love to see

377
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:50,899
cannabis part of a universal health care

378
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:55,309
system and not owned primarily or only

379
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:56,389
by the pharmaceutical industry hi wait a

380
00:16:55,309 --> 00:17:00,289
second

381
00:16:56,389 --> 00:17:01,850
I had debilitating migraines so much so

382
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:04,338
that they wanted to put me out on

383
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,230
disability and I'm an attorney you don't

384
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:10,190
hire an attorney who has a cognitive

385
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:12,588
deficit for migraines and I was able to

386
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:16,578
get a standing prescription of 60 to 90

387
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:18,649
opioids in a month and then I had to

388
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:20,720
leave California to go to my family in

389
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,550
Arizona and luckily cannabis was there

390
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,650
for me and that's why I have a career

391
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:25,909
they started advocating for you know the

392
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,220
single most important person in your

393
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:30,620
life is you right you are irreplaceable

394
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,410
to yourself and so I had to start

395
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:35,539
advocating for myself and through the

396
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,910
advocacy of myself I was advocating for

397
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:41,809
those that were providing clean medicine

398
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:45,590
so to echo Brett's statement we need to

399
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:47,990
see reform for cannabis such that it's

400
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:51,139
not thirty two thousand dollars a year

401
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:54,380
to be a patient to get epidemics that's

402
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:57,050
just it's unfathomable and you don't get

403
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,480
insurance you don't get medical reform

404
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:01,669
without insurance reform and we haven't

405
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,829
seen that and cannabis can be such a

406
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,710
good conduit I like to think of it as

407
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:09,409
the mirror that we can look at how we

408
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:12,440
deal with so many other issues and treat

409
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:14,900
so many other drugs that could be if

410
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,950
used and dispelled with this nefarious

411
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:21,080
brush better than their opioid

412
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,600
counterparts that are only there because

413
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:26,210
the pharmaceutical companies are pushing

414
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:29,149
them don't take away the small business

415
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:31,190
that California is built on in cannabis

416
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:34,400
and replace it with the pharmaceutical

417
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:37,190
companies by blanketing reform that

418
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:45,500
allows for them to de schedule instead

419
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:46,970
of the schedule without a plan so thank

420
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,720
you very much this is wonderful employed

421
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:52,610
I appreciate very much the input that

422
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,410
I've received it's important that all

423
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:56,119
elected officials all policymakers

424
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:58,940
listen to all the perspectives you know

425
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:02,419
I'd be remiss if I don't also introduce

426
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:06,259
