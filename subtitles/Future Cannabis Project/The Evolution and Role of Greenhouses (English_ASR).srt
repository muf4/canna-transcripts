00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:15,948
so hi I'm dr. Nadia Saba president and

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,390
founder of dr. greenhouse we are an HVAC

4
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:20,339
well we're a mechanical and agricultural

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,330
engineering firm that specializes in

6
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:26,849
HVAC design for indoor farms and

7
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:29,669
greenhouses greenhouses is where I got

8
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,700
my start trying to grow mushrooms in a

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,309
greenhouse talk about challenging or

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,730
trying to grow you know a crop that

11
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:41,909
likes it damp and cool in a greenhouse

12
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:44,429
in southern Idaho we had a humidity

13
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:46,109
control problem but the opposite of what

14
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,780
everyone is normally thinking about we

15
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,939
couldn't keep it wet enough you know

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,390
that for me it was my aha moment 22

17
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:58,140
years ago that I wanted to help farmers

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,170
control their environments so fast

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,500
forward went to PhD I did my PhD at the

20
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,320
University of Arizona where I studied

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,810
greenhouse production of tomatoes and

22
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:13,048
had a special focus on water use

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,799
efficiency so it's not always about

24
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,020
energy

25
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,439
sometimes it's about other resources

26
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:23,640
that we are also trying to conserve in

27
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:26,579
our farms enough about me you're gonna

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,299
hear plenty from me earlier or later not

29
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:33,509
earlier later I'm gonna let my panel

30
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,430
here introduce themselves and I think

31
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:40,500
some of them have some slides to share

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:43,259
with all of you all right thanks so hi

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,799
I'm Tim Kenneth on the co-founder and

34
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,750
executive vice president of back little

35
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,520
leaf farms used to be back their farms

36
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,688
literally farms we are five acres of

37
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:56,670
hydroponic lettuce in Devon's

38
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:01,169
Massachusetts it's NF T Mobile gutter

39
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:03,769
system yeah let's do the video do the

40
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,769
video real quick

41
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:16,959
[Music]

42
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:20,378
I was always interested in and locally

43
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,930
grown food I have been involved with

44
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:24,789
greenhouses for most of my life all

45
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,680
called me up said hey listen this

46
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:29,079
lettuce business possibly figured out

47
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,450
yet I felt strongly that we could do it

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,000
a different way grow local and then

49
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:36,818
deliver a better superior fresher

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,769
product we basically have learned from I

51
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:41,289
think the best practices around the

52
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:45,730
world and found our own unique way of

53
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:48,669
operating here at literally farms over

54
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:52,090
95% of all the lettuce that we consume

55
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:54,729
is grown in California in Arizona for

56
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,620
3,200 miles away from where they're

57
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:58,929
growing these products on the west coast

58
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,670
but for us it's it's simpler because we

59
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,870
cut it we deliver it and it's in the

60
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:04,598
store within 24 hours

61
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,879
we're successfully competing against the

62
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:09,969
the proven West Coast operations with

63
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,219
close to 10 acres under glass people

64
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:13,840
didn't know what good lettuce was and

65
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:17,739
then all of a sudden we reset the

66
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,170
expectation we're all about giving the

67
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,599
plant what the plant needs and taking

68
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:23,979
away all stresses we're not in charge

69
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,310
the plants are the ones that are in

70
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:29,979
charge we're just living in their world

71
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,139
hydroponic means grown without soil so

72
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:34,840
it's way easier for up the plants they

73
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:37,090
don't have to you know work they just

74
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,239
can take it up and enjoy the song and

75
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,628
just grow

76
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,878
big believer in the Sun it's free the

77
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:46,318
light we're running from soda fields the

78
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,229
watery collapse from the rooftop and

79
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,089
reuse so we throw nothing away people

80
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,639
ask us what are you doing to the lettuce

81
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,250
it's what we don't do to the lettuce we

82
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,179
never get the lettuce wet we never spray

83
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,829
it with anything

84
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,599
my family's for lettuce all my

85
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:03,030
colleagues eat the lettuce and so I

86
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,738
don't want to have pesticide residue I

87
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,750
don't want to be herbicide residue we

88
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,938
don't make it travel miles we don't let

89
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,419
it sit around we don't trip we'll wash

90
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:11,250
it

91
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,348
over the course of moving it through

92
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,818
some chlorinated waters for it to have

93
00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:17,069
kill steps in it because we don't need

94
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:18,120
to and we're basically feeding people's

95
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:20,548
families and that's a big responsibility

96
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,310
I really believe this is the right word

97
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:25,379
Romans I think that it's it's a lot more

98
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,560
sustainable it's a lot more efficient

99
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,909
it's a lot safer and it also comes up

100
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,490
with a better quality product New

101
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,189
England at one time was a huge food

102
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:38,160
producer we fed ourselves and I love the

103
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:40,168
fact that we can be part of the catalyst

104
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,639
and being a driver here and as we

105
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:43,109
succeed in New England we look forward

106
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,530
to going to other regions and doing the

107
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,530
same thing

108
00:04:52,550 --> 00:05:03,090
[Music]

109
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:05,460
so so that's us Paul so Paul's the

110
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:06,649
president/ceo he was originally supposed

111
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:09,180
to be here

112
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:11,399
got unavoidably detained and asked me to

113
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,590
come in a stud so appreciate the

114
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:18,629
invitation I've got some slides but I'll

115
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:21,589
do those later No okay contribute my

116
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:24,810
slides please so so like Paul said

117
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:28,109
basically we are a technology taker as

118
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,720
opposed to a technology maker and one of

119
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,240
the things that we do is we take a look

120
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,759
at where the technology comes from and

121
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,259
basically it's the Netherlands Pete our

122
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:43,020
grower is fourth generation Dutch grower

123
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:44,819
and we basically you take a look is that

124
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,769
you know there's a country the size of

125
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:48,539
New York State about 1/10 the size of

126
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:53,788
California and that the number 2

127
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:56,158
exporter of food in the world and the

128
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:59,068
reason that they do that is simple it's

129
00:05:56,158 --> 00:06:01,348
it's greenhouses so I'm not sure how

130
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:03,539
many people are familiar with with

131
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:05,939
Holland or the Dutch greenhouse industry

132
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:09,478
or in particular the Westlands which is

133
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:11,490
a picture of this they've been at it for

134
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:15,360
a long time and in terms of continuous

135
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,949
improvement they're they're not just the

136
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,580
greenhouse growing industry but also

137
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:22,978
glass manufacturers water systems the

138
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:26,490
growing system that you saw in our in

139
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:29,459
our video is actually from Finland the

140
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,560
Dutch had not figured out a good what we

141
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:34,560
felt was a good lettuce growing system

142
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,418
it already figured out tomato industry

143
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,668
cucumber industry pepper industry

144
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:40,258
obviously the flower industry but

145
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:42,120
lettuce and leafy greens they hadn't

146
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,280
figured out yet we actually found a

147
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,250
Finnish company that was growing lettuce

148
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,959
for about 5 years in the Arctic Circle

149
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,899
that we took you know we basically took

150
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,899
it in brought it in and then basically

151
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:57,168
continued to refine and retrofit it the

152
00:06:54,899 --> 00:07:00,269
one thing I would say in all of these

153
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:02,370
sessions that I've gone to on a listen

154
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:05,250
to people is that there's not I'm a

155
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,139
produce guy I've got 30 years in the

156
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,028
experience my first job was on

157
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,370
pineapples for doll into the Hunts Point

158
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:14,850
terminal market in New York City and

159
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:17,370
I've gone from there um it's about the

160
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,139
product and there's not a lot of

161
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,910
discussion about product in these

162
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,550
sessions and maybe it's because of the

163
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:26,850
the audience but the one thing I would

164
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:29,970
say is that we focus in on the product

165
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,949
the variety our product strategy how

166
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:35,760
we're going to get to market because the

167
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:37,290
markets being served people that want to

168
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,579
put up greenhouses and feel well I'm

169
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,050
going to have a local product and

170
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:42,719
everybody's going to beat a path to my

171
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:46,050
door that is not the case you have to

172
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,900
come in and be able to compete at if not

173
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,240
better than the market that's currently

174
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:54,209
serving is so that's basically our view

175
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,728
is the Salinas Valley since we have

176
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:58,259
opened so it's been we've been operating

177
00:07:56,728 --> 00:08:00,930
for three years we actually have the

178
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,668
number one SKU our baby crispy green

179
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,310
lettuce is the number one selling salad

180
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:07,529
in New England from a single SKU we we

181
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,449
beat organic baby spinach last year

182
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,879
which we're pretty excited about and

183
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:15,060
were to continue into ground and and

184
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:17,129
basically it's it's my job is we you

185
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,470
know I came from backyard farms we ran a

186
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:23,098
42 acre tomato into business out of

187
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,720
Maine and I had proven basically a

188
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:26,699
relationships with all these customers

189
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,580
so we're in over two thousand grocery

190
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:31,439
stores in New England and we're not

191
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,978
we're having a tough time keeping up

192
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,168
with demand but you have to get

193
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,550
tractioning with these guys if you're

194
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:41,668
going to actually sell something our

195
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:44,519
business is all about scale we are

196
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:47,819
looking to to basically compete

197
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,490
head-to-head with the salinas valley for

198
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,900
shelf space and share a stomach and and

199
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:56,480
that's what we've been basically doing

200
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,480
so that's it those are my slides

201
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:02,779
I'm Dave Nichols director of strategy

202
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:05,280
for AB harvest we're building a 60 acre

203
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:10,949
lettuce facility or it's re tomato

204
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:13,439
facility in Morehead Kentucky I'm

205
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,570
scheduled to open up September of this

206
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,090
year it's kind of our view that there's

207
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,970
a huge opportunity to build greenhouses

208
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,769
at scale in the United States from some

209
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,480
of the support our view here is there's

210
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:27,259
a high demand for food we need 70

211
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,550
percent more food in the world by 2050

212
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:31,429
sustainability is a big topic across the

213
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:33,899
investment community and the economy

214
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:35,699
boost of acreage really in America we

215
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,129
have between a thousand two thousand

216
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,210
acre as well as Tim said and Netherlands

217
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:39,779
they have more than twenty thousand

218
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,870
acres

219
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:44,429
second largest exporter of agricultural

220
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,200
products in the world so it's it's it's

221
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:49,019
a great model there's a lot of room for

222
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,030
growth in the u.s. AG tech ecosystems

223
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,850
are successful like that Netherlands is

224
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:55,559
great 20,000 acres Leamington Ontario

225
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:58,710
these facilities team two seem to

226
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:00,689
benefit from clustering improving health

227
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,400
care one to 10 Americans eats enough

228
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,470
fruits and vegetables just imagine if we

229
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,899
can get that up to two or three how will

230
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,700
grow the market increasing interest in

231
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,740
farming average age of the farmer in the

232
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,180
US right now is 58 I mean we really

233
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,100
think controlled environment egg is the

234
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:16,259
opportunity to bring young people into

235
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,810
agriculture really make it cool again

236
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,340
it's a technology it's it's it's a big

237
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:22,679
opportunity the big challenge and

238
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,570
economic development right now we're

239
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:27,000
importing four billion pounds of

240
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,640
tomatoes from Mexico we think why not

241
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,500
bring net production home the trends are

242
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,330
in our favor increasing demand for

243
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,649
plant-based foods you see that with

244
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,300
burger king is selling a plant-based

245
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,110
food there's there's got to be a trend

246
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:42,329
here veganism is increasing and need for

247
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,740
innovation we're not gonna be able to

248
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,940
feed the world on the way we're growing

249
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,230
right now so we need to have some tech

250
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,310
knowledge and I think controlled

251
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,149
environment agriculture is that

252
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:52,109
technology over the summer of the Uni PC

253
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:54,689
came out with a really interesting

254
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,460
report on food systems and climate

255
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,930
change it's really the best

256
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,000
advertisement you could see for a

257
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:01,079
controlled environment agriculture

258
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,570
basically saying climate change is

259
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,129
affecting the way for the breadbasket of

260
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,810
the world where food is grown we're

261
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:09,029
gonna need more food the only way we're

262
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:10,138
gonna get there is technology and all

263
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:12,088
that technology

264
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:14,220
points to greenhouses and controlled

265
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:16,199
environment agriculture a UN sustainable

266
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,389
development goals that we use these all

267
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:20,368
the time there's 17 of them it's a great

268
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:21,749
it's a great tool for going into the

269
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:23,910
sustainable investment community but

270
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:25,528
green it we we chose these six but

271
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:27,448
really greenhouses can fit into 13 out

272
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:31,860
of the 17 so it's really it's a

273
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:33,149
sustainable business when we started at

274
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,909
harvest we knew we just couldn't drop a

275
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,928
greenhouse into the middle of Kentucky

276
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:38,969
and be successful we had to build a

277
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:40,769
community around it we really set out to

278
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,069
build an ecosystem we started that from

279
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:45,659
day one a little bit about why Kentucky

280
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:48,509
I was gonna get my sales pitch in here

281
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:50,188
from Kentucky we can reach 70 percent of

282
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:53,989
the US population the one day's drive

283
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:56,818
it's a great place for a produce hub and

284
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:58,290
energy prices are relatively low record

285
00:11:56,818 --> 00:12:01,528
amounts of rainfall the last three years

286
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:03,088
and easy access to natural gas and and

287
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:05,850
really the most important kind of the

288
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,949
commission for our company is the labor

289
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,659
force in Kentucky so as we all know that

290
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:12,028
coal industry is taking a big hit over

291
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:14,100
the past four or five years lost tens of

292
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:15,360
thousands of jobs our view is we need a

293
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,920
new industry to come and revive the

294
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,769
region these are some of the the

295
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:22,378
hardest-working people in America labor

296
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:24,749
is a huge challenge in all greenhouses

297
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:26,999
so we figured it's a great spot to kind

298
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:28,139
of come in and build a greenhouse and

299
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:31,558
start a sort of new industry in

300
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,480
Appalachia we started a ground game from

301
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:35,610
the beginning we knew it wasn't gonna be

302
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,379
easy to that's really gonna day one we

303
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,058
got to have 285 employees working in our

304
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:41,548
greenhouse so we've had a community

305
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:43,528
outreach effort since day one we've got

306
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:44,639
MOA use with for the local addiction

307
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:48,360
recovery care centers

308
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,610
so obviously opioids are a huge issue

309
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,289
around the country even worse than Apple

310
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,600
a just we've got a program where we

311
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:58,490
transition the clients from recovery

312
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,970
into the workforce into the green house

313
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,428
government and we would think

314
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,860
government's a big issue we work from

315
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:06,149
with state local federal and even

316
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,269
international governments we had a

317
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:10,619
meeting with sonny perdue controlled

318
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:12,688
environment agra is very much on his

319
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:14,339
radar he's visited facility and in

320
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:15,659
Georgia in his home state and recently

321
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,399
did a trip to the Netherlands to kind of

322
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:19,798
to get a kind of a view of the

323
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,418
Netherlands ecosystem we we had the

324
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,499
opportunity to pitch a controlled

325
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:23,590
environment act to the UN Security

326
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:25,659
Council

327
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:28,690
of all people that came to came to

328
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:30,279
Kentucky and our CEO got an audience

329
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,740
with them sat down talked about the

330
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:34,149
industry and there I mean obviously it's

331
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,159
really a global opportunity right now

332
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:37,509
China's adding thousands of acres a year

333
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,370
and a thousands hundreds of acres a year

334
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:41,139
Russia's adding a lot of acreage there's

335
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,490
a lot of a lot of activity or at least

336
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,750
talked of activity in the Middle East so

337
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,700
it's really it's really a global

338
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,850
opportunity and most importantly

339
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,940
education oh we started we realize we

340
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:54,100
got a good create an ecosystem we need

341
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,050
farmers we need people to be excited the

342
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,259
kids to be excited about agriculture so

343
00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:00,729
we started last fall a AG tech education

344
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:02,799
program in Shelby Valley High School

345
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,080
which is in Pikeville Kentucky right in

346
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,849
the middle of coal country the program

347
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,970
was it's been very successful ninety

348
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,590
kids signed up for 33 spots where we

349
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,870
teach basic horticulture and plant

350
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:16,450
science and then we have harvest put in

351
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,509
a freight farms unit on campus there so

352
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,710
the kids get classroom training and then

353
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:23,620
some hands-on growing experience in the

354
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:25,540
container growing leafy greens and at

355
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,669
the college level we're engaged with all

356
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:29,019
all five local universities University

357
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:30,909
of Kentucky Berea College

358
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:32,710
Eastern Kentucky University Morehead

359
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:35,289
State and University of Pikeville we

360
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,600
just finished a eight day trip to the

361
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:40,029
Netherlands with ten professors from the

362
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,230
University just kind of Dutch Dutch

363
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,939
government sponsored the trip just

364
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,710
really giving them exposure to what's

365
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,420
possible think if we can make make this

366
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,750
all this ecosystem happen so that was a

367
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:51,009
that was a great trip so that's it's

368
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,950
kind of a little bit about our company

369
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:56,350
in our playbook and follow us on social

370
00:14:53,950 --> 00:15:00,670
media leading up to the launch year and

371
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:03,810
September thank you hi I'm kale Harvick

372
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:06,699
I work at USDA in a new position

373
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:08,469
formerly at Cornell but I work for ARS

374
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,000
the research arm at USDA

375
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,910
I just wanted to spend a few minutes

376
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,480
talking about some of our upcoming

377
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:18,990
research projects first of all virtual

378
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,129
grower is software that's used for

379
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,970
greenhouse growers to be able to plan

380
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:25,639
lighting systems or

381
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,230
both patterns of their plants or energy

382
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,698
modeling we're going to be coming out

383
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,769
with a new version of that hopefully by

384
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:32,599
the end of the year there was a hiring

385
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:34,850
freeze in the federal government for

386
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,079
about three years ended last year so

387
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,860
we're gonna be able to fill some of

388
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:41,299
those vacancies now and release a new

389
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,100
version of the software but we've got a

390
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:45,679
lot of big plans for it we're going to

391
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,290
improve the energy modeling capabilities

392
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,969
using a lot of my previous research

393
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:52,549
improve the lighting system capabilities

394
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:55,970
to be able to do more sophisticated cost

395
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:58,128
comparisons and you know specify custom

396
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,959
geometry for your for your buildings we

397
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:02,509
also want to have a research mode that's

398
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:04,250
kind of more technical more advanced for

399
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:06,560
University and government researchers to

400
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,759
be able to use the software to do some

401
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,299
of the research that we've done

402
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,220
previously done a lot of work with

403
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:15,588
uniformity of lighting systems so if you

404
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,000
look at the system on the left you see

405
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:18,769
kind of a bull's-eye pattern and that's

406
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,198
that's really what happens every time

407
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:23,179
you have lights that are in a plane that

408
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,679
are equally spaced you're pretty much

409
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:26,929
guaranteed to get a bull's-eye pattern

410
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:29,750
especially on smaller greenhouses and

411
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:32,359
shells so we've done a lot of work on

412
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,799
how to optimize that to make a more

413
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,688
uniform lighting system either by

414
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:37,849
changing spacing or changing intensity

415
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:41,808
of individual lights so we're going to

416
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,759
continue some of that work near field

417
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:46,639
optimization so this is basically the

418
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,068
issue of if you have short distance

419
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,110
between lights and plants all the other

420
00:16:49,068 --> 00:16:52,338
techniques for measuring light don't

421
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,649
really work because they're meant for

422
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:56,689
long distances so we're developing

423
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:58,659
specialized modeling and measurement

424
00:16:56,688 --> 00:17:02,179
techniques to address the unique

425
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:06,980
uniformity issues of very close light to

426
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:08,928
canopy systems drones and greenhouses so

427
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,970
there's a lot of big work being done in

428
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,439
the field agriculture space with drones

429
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,558
we're going to bring some of that

430
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,909
technology into the greenhouse starting

431
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:18,619
with light mapping but then we're going

432
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:22,419
to expand to machine vision applications

433
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:24,588
so for example being able to look in

434
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:27,860
spectra that are outside of the human

435
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:29,450
vision to look for disease indicators so

436
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:31,668
you imagine a drone flying around your

437
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,740
crop and it'll spot disease indicators

438
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:36,200
before you're able to see it as a

439
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,650
with your naked eye so we're excited

440
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,720
about that project and I wanted to close

441
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,740
with some just tips on if you're if

442
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,450
you're thinking about starting a new

443
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,329
greenhouse business leads are some key

444
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,519
things that you know free advice that I

445
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:50,779
recommend so number one do your due

446
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,299
diligence before you build anything

447
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:56,750
almost no one does this in my opinion

448
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:58,789
they have great plans and energy and

449
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,500
that's great but you really got to have

450
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:00,859
somebody who knows the energy side of

451
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,410
things

452
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:04,849
HVAC side of things lighting side of

453
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,490
things give you an accurate cost

454
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:09,589
estimate and see what you're getting

455
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,970
into you don't have to worry about this

456
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:13,099
if you're in California but in the

457
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,420
Northeast thermal curtain is huge it's

458
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:16,990
like probably the number one thing you

459
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:20,710
can do to save on your heating costs

460
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,819
lighting control systems that minimize

461
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,529
your use of supplemental light

462
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:28,009
unfortunately commercially available

463
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:29,839
lighting control that's out there right

464
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:31,730
now is still pretty rudimentary compared

465
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,289
to what we have in the research world so

466
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,490
you know we're working to try to bring

467
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:36,079
some of that technology into the

468
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:39,259
commercial space but there's a long way

469
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,980
to go of course looking at your efficacy

470
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:42,829
of your luminaires

471
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,120
is important making sure you have the

472
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:47,599
right amount of supplemental light that

473
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:49,189
you're not under sized and then you know

474
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,049
a big one which nineties can talk more

475
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,519
about this afternoon is install HVAC

476
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:56,599
systems that are appropriate for your

477
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:58,789
situation your location your crop the

478
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:00,859
type of building you have there is no

479
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:03,079
one-size-fits-all approach to this so

480
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:07,879
you really need some good engineering

481
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:09,799
there utility rate schedules I see a lot

482
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,470
of people that kind of get screwed by

483
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:14,119
their utilities unfortunately because

484
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,589
there's a lot of choice sometimes for

485
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,539
the utility rate schedule that you can

486
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:20,209
be placed on you might be able to get a

487
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:22,670
more advantageous one if you look into

488
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,470
it a little bit more because the the

489
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,940
basic schedule that you get put on might

490
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,549
not be the most economically

491
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,170
advantageous for your business and then

492
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:34,639
finally check with the local utilities

493
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:35,929
for available incentive programs and

494
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,290
I'll wrap it up there and look forward

495
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:40,750
your questions at the end

496
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:42,579
I hello everyone move up here so I can

497
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,740
point to my slides my name is Erika

498
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:46,059
Matos and I am the director of the

499
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,150
greenhouse lighting in systems

500
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:51,250
engineering consortium I think while we

501
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:55,210
just hear from our panelists here it's a

502
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:57,609
perfect setup for my talk we are we come

503
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:00,309
to life we are seven-year $5,000,000

504
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:01,599
project and our goal is to develop to

505
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:03,490
answer and implement new

506
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,799
energy-efficient technologies to reduce

507
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,039
the energy causes of lighting in

508
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:10,629
greenhouses and indoor farms

509
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:12,659
so pretty much we can develop anything

510
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,670
so then people like King literally farms

511
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,279
technology takers don't have to develop

512
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:20,289
it's ready to go but we do that by

513
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:22,000
working with the private and a lot of

514
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:24,519
partners what I want to talk to you

515
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,869
today four quick topics our program is

516
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:27,460
very comprehensive so I'm just going to

517
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:29,979
do a quick overview in four quick things

518
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,009
we are talking about futures farms of

519
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,329
the future here so the first one is

520
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:36,339
models to accelerate technology

521
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:38,500
development the risk and bring those

522
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:40,299
technologies to market with glaze we

523
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,339
work with five main pillars here we're

524
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:44,470
working with manufacturers some lighting

525
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:48,519
manufacturers sensors and controls

526
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:50,380
greenhouse growers retailers and policy

527
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:53,889
makers or energy efficient companies

528
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:56,830
service service providers we work with

529
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,390
for actually three academic partners

530
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,789
which is Cornell University Rutgers

531
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,290
University and Rensselaer Polytechnic

532
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:04,329
Institute in New York in New Jersey and

533
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:06,430
were funded by the state of New York but

534
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:07,990
we are a public private consortium so

535
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,210
that means we work with several industry

536
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,490
members she really did risk this

537
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,620
technology the development process we're

538
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,569
constantly interacting with them to

539
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:18,699
understand find the gaps between those

540
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:20,049
different segments and understand what

541
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,880
we are developing that is a technology

542
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:23,589
that is ready to go to the market at the

543
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,410
right price and at the right time can

544
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:27,909
solve a problem and we seen recently

545
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,140
that this model has been more and more

546
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,420
adopted it's becoming more common

547
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,190
because makes a lot of sense here have

548
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,250
three other examples there is this

549
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,630
programming lamp led by University of

550
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,190
Georgia is a five million dollars

551
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,130
program and you have several

552
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:45,880
collaborators there to minimize costs of

553
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:47,890
lighting you have optimi I a that's

554
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,500
recently awarded the leading

555
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,169
universities Michigan University really

556
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,419
focus on reducing the causes of

557
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:56,009
your farm so again they work with

558
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:59,070
several institutions is sponsored by the

559
00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:01,409
USDA and we have new institutions like

560
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:03,210
the RI you have too many members I

561
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:04,919
didn't but that members here but I think

562
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,720
the main goal here is you working in

563
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,009
five different categories so bringing

564
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,989
all these different moving parts

565
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:11,669
together we have to collaborate that's

566
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:13,798
how we gonna bring that's how I see the

567
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:15,450
futures the greenhouses of the future

568
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:18,589
and indoor farms of the future as well

569
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,639
so I wanna give now one quick example of

570
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:22,858
integrated technology that's only

571
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:24,839
possible when we are working together we

572
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:26,368
call let's see which is light and shade

573
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:27,628
system implementation that's something

574
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:29,579
Kay you just mentioned one of the

575
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:31,528
control systems to optimize lighting

576
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:33,058
delivery in greenhouses and aspects of

577
00:22:31,528 --> 00:22:35,878
that can be using your farms as well

578
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:37,888
so what lassie does is it monitors the

579
00:22:35,878 --> 00:22:39,868
ambient so the first aspect here is the

580
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:42,028
environment is monitoring how much Sun

581
00:22:39,868 --> 00:22:44,278
is being provided throughout the day and

582
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:46,048
based on that calculates how much

583
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:48,269
supplemental lighting should be provided

584
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:50,519
to achieve a certain DLI they light

585
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:52,589
integral so you can see here we are

586
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:54,690
measuring from June through July 19 I

587
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:56,459
know that's a sunny period of the year

588
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,249
but the reason I did that is because we

589
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,840
also control shade some of the DRI

590
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:02,639
controllers available they will provide

591
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:05,220
more light but they do not control shade

592
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:06,808
so here is a true DIY control so the

593
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,200
first aspect is controlling their light

594
00:23:06,808 --> 00:23:12,358
you can see here the green line is the

595
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,249
target DLI and then it has the red and

596
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:16,528
blue it's an LED lighting systems and an

597
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:19,038
HPS lighting system so I get really

598
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:21,749
close to the target every day

599
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,339
second aspect here trying to integrate

600
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:25,108
the control systems looking at the

601
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:27,569
plants now so how plants respond to

602
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:29,548
lighting in co2 if you understand that

603
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:31,980
one of the examples that I have here

604
00:23:29,548 --> 00:23:34,220
it's Abhiyan it's a strawberry crop and

605
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,259
what we see here is the net assimilation

606
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:40,230
co2 per meter square per second in

607
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:42,659
micromoles versus lighting intensity so

608
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,519
we have 500 micro malls a thousand 1,500

609
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:46,889
and 2,000 under different co2

610
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:49,230
concentrations I want to want take out

611
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:51,628
of this graphic which is under different

612
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:53,608
co2 concentrations you can achieve the

613
00:23:51,628 --> 00:23:57,509
same narrow simulation which we are here

614
00:23:53,608 --> 00:24:02,398
about seven you can get at 500 micro

615
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:04,919
moles you get a 7-under 675 ppm I think

616
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:05,849
that silicon here exactly from here but

617
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,130
if you use a higher

618
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:09,449
to concentration which is now nine

619
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:12,120
hundred nine hundred and seventy five

620
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,308
you get the same assimilation using

621
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:17,250
thirty percent less energy so you can

622
00:24:14,308 --> 00:24:19,139
achieve that under 350 micromoles light

623
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:21,390
intensity throughout giving the same DLI

624
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,750
so there are significant savings if you

625
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:26,429
can control together lighting and co2

626
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,079
now the last aspect that we I think

627
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:29,820
really playing a big role into the

628
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:32,639
future is now looking at the grid the

629
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:34,710
energy we call day ahead market price so

630
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,780
this graphic here shows how the peaks

631
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:39,720
vary throughout the year so have all the

632
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:42,779
hours of the year and the the red line

633
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,230
here is the average price it's about 17

634
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:49,408
gigawatts and the pig price is about 32

635
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:51,990
so energy price the average energy price

636
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:53,460
is 40% lower than the peak time so what

637
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,200
I want you do here we run integrate

638
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,850
these three variables so you're looking

639
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,140
for the environment you're looking for

640
00:24:56,849 --> 00:25:00,209
the crops and you're looking for the

641
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,549
grid how can you make decisions having

642
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:03,750
all these inputs to provide the same

643
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:05,970
amount of light every day that you need

644
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:09,029
for a crop using the minimum amount of

645
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:11,339
energy so this is carbon reduction what

646
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:13,678
we do that to show the savings that is

647
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:17,189
possible here's a quick setup that I did

648
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,559
so we run an integrated model using gem

649
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,570
greenhouse energy model is one of one of

650
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:24,149
the available models that guy okay you

651
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:26,639
talk about we pick Ataka in New York as

652
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:28,890
the location target DL I was 17 moles

653
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,340
per meter squared per day two different

654
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:36,210
lighting lighting levels at the crop one

655
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:38,759
at 180 micromoles one at 250 the own

656
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:43,380
peak electricity cost as we use 0.12

657
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:47,099
cents off-peak 0.08 cents and then co2

658
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,039
causes at 50 cents per kilogram results

659
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,808
are pretty impressive what happened

660
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,819
using the basic lassi control looking

661
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:56,089
just the environment would cost in

662
00:25:53,819 --> 00:26:00,089
dollars per meter square per year about

663
00:25:56,089 --> 00:26:03,619
$28 under the 180 micromoles light level

664
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:06,359
and about $18 under the 250 micro mouse

665
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:08,279
light level if we use the different

666
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,990
technologies now to talk lassi and then

667
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:12,359
the second one was lighting environment

668
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:14,429
plus co2 the third one the day ahead

669
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:15,869
market price analysis so the grid and

670
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:18,900
the environment and the last one

671
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:19,739
combining grid plan physiology which is

672
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,490
the co2

673
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,730
station and lassie we come down to about

674
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:29,339
nine dollars and about $60 that means

675
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:31,700
almost 70% less energy than the basic

676
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:33,959
control and sixty percent less energy

677
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,779
under the second light level so that's

678
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,370
pretty significant now the problem is

679
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:39,839
how we take these technologies and

680
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:42,089
implement on the market we have this

681
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,039
available in the research that's why we

682
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:45,689
have to work with companies we have to

683
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:47,490
collaborate we're gonna implement these

684
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,320
technologies into commercial greenhouses

685
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:52,440
in New York which are part of the glaze

686
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:55,139
consortium wanting named SAF produce in

687
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,660
Berlin New York one with feud gardens in

688
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,370
Buffalo New York and they will be over

689
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,110
the next four years implementing these

690
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:03,000
technologies so you can create a

691
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:04,678
baseline right now to show how much

692
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,670
they're spending right now and over the

693
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,559
next three years they're gonna be

694
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:09,480
implementing environmental part of the

695
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:11,910
control with less than shochu let's see

696
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,339
then then co2 laser suits that they had

697
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,960
markets youichi let's see now pretty

698
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:17,759
quick here data analysis going to be

699
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,200
another big part of the greenhouse of

700
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,869
the future here I have two examples

701
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,370
using a similar lighting control tulasi

702
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:25,859
but we can't we'll just lightly not

703
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:28,289
shade in this case is a green housing

704
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:30,240
Georgia you can see on the blue this is

705
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:33,329
data from November all the way to

706
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,220
February the blue bars represent the

707
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:36,689
amount of sunlight in radiation we get

708
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,460
the crops and the green lights

709
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,049
supplemental lighting with an

710
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,299
intelligent lighting control there you

711
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:43,950
can keep modulating the lights we are

712
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:45,450
trying to get close to the target the

713
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,429
daylight target which is the red line

714
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,840
over here what I want to show the

715
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:50,730
difference in data analysis don't have

716
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,629
to look at the prices exactly here but I

717
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,610
really want to show here is the

718
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:56,190
difference between a green housing

719
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:58,079
Georgia when we have certain environment

720
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,330
and one in New York during the similar

721
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,949
amount of time in New York to achieve

722
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:04,439
the same deal I the lights basically

723
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,970
needs to be on all the time because the

724
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,549
weather is really different from Georgia

725
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,839
now if you don't have a dynamic lighting

726
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:11,849
system you're going to be on all the

727
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,649
time or half part of the time

728
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:15,750
take a look what happen at the last few

729
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:18,450
days in Georgia in the last few days in

730
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,890
New York we have a bad week in Georgia

731
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,360
and then the intelligent lighting

732
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,640
control system just bring your light

733
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,009
zone as much as it's needed so then you

734
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,480
can ensure the crop quality now in New

735
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:29,069
York is the other way around you get a

736
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,079
few good days the lighting control

737
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:32,999
system kicks in and saves energy for you

738
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:35,068
and you can get you the same deal I

739
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:36,509
or close as maximum as you can so the

740
00:28:35,068 --> 00:28:37,138
importance of data knowledge is going to

741
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:39,838
be huge

742
00:28:37,138 --> 00:28:42,148
moving to the future last one very quick

743
00:28:39,838 --> 00:28:44,308
is the lighting low demand response I

744
00:28:42,148 --> 00:28:47,098
think that's the very important one for

745
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:49,078
us to keep in mind the IES ODEs the

746
00:28:47,098 --> 00:28:51,928
independent electricity systems operator

747
00:28:49,078 --> 00:28:53,578
in Canada put up this big report talking

748
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:58,859
about the importance of managing the

749
00:28:53,578 --> 00:29:00,808
loads those are Peaks peak electricity

750
00:28:58,858 --> 00:29:02,368
peak time throughout the year so they

751
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:03,868
are foreseen that they're gonna need to

752
00:29:02,368 --> 00:29:05,788
work with the greenhouse to reduce the

753
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:08,278
load when necessary through December

754
00:29:05,788 --> 00:29:10,138
through March and then here the hours of

755
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:11,969
the day when you have this peak hours I

756
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:14,548
don't want to go too much into the

757
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:16,048
detail here but I wanna for this crowd

758
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:17,818
that is horticultural lighting there are

759
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:19,888
technologies that can reduce the energy

760
00:29:17,818 --> 00:29:21,178
load over the speak times but are not

761
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:22,318
looking to the crops so have to

762
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,479
understand what's happening with the

763
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:26,548
crops can they take this amount of load

764
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:28,439
can we reduce how many times of the year

765
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:31,378
can I do this how much can we reduce the

766
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:32,759
light for the crops and that can only be

767
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:34,198
assessed that if we know what's happened

768
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,749
with the crops in the environment in

769
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:38,489
real time so I think there would be a

770
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:40,528
big big part of the greenhouses of the

771
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:41,969
future and in terms of the future having

772
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,108
them connect to the grid and making

773
00:29:41,969 --> 00:29:46,499
these smart decisions

774
00:29:43,108 --> 00:29:48,478
considering the crops as well that's it

775
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:50,098
for now we are with glaze so we have a

776
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:52,169
ton of educational outreach information

777
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:53,458
if you wanna learn more about you can go

778
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:55,409
to the website you can sign to the

779
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,818
newsletter and I hope you guys have good

780
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:59,059
questions for us right now thank you so

781
00:29:56,818 --> 00:29:59,058
much

782
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:09,908
so yesterday we were shown a slide that

783
00:30:05,648 --> 00:30:11,738
dem that showed a pie chart and on that

784
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:15,399
pie chart and it showed that greenhouses

785
00:30:11,739 --> 00:30:17,588
use proportionately more heating energy

786
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:21,308
or at least gas I don't know what it's

787
00:30:17,588 --> 00:30:23,829
used for necessarily than an indoor

788
00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:25,868
facility and I was wondering if any of

789
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:29,858
you could speak to that trend that we

790
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:31,778
saw and why gas use might be higher in a

791
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:34,358
greenhouse and if you would expect the

792
00:30:31,778 --> 00:30:36,759
same trend for a greenhouse where you

793
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:40,088
guys are located and I realized we don't

794
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:41,950
have anyone from southern states and the

795
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,569
Sun Belt represented up here but if you

796
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,149
could also maybe speak to if you have

797
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:48,819
any experience there of if we might see

798
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:51,308
different energy trends yea the

799
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:52,960
greenhouse energy profile is definitely

800
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,940
very climate dependent so in the

801
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,798
northern states you have a lot of

802
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,739
natural gas use for some other heating

803
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,569
fuel you also have less sunlight so you

804
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:03,819
typically need more supplemental light

805
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:06,009
than you do in the south as you go south

806
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:08,288
that heating energy goes down but the

807
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:10,179
lighting energy also goes down cooling

808
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,648
doesn't change too much if you're able

809
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:14,830
to use evaporative cooling you're

810
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:16,658
basically just blowing blowing fans the

811
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:18,338
south east it's a special case and I bet

812
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:21,249
Nadi will talk more about that this

813
00:31:18,338 --> 00:31:23,288
afternoon but in general energy goes

814
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:25,028
energy consumption goes down for the

815
00:31:23,288 --> 00:31:28,388
greenhouse as you go south and it's a

816
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:31,749
dramatic decrease however we can still

817
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:33,398
you know have profitable greenhouses in

818
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:35,379
the Northeast you know little leaf farms

819
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:37,148
is a great great example of that so you

820
00:31:35,378 --> 00:31:39,988
just need the right systems for that

821
00:31:37,148 --> 00:31:39,988
location

822
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:45,519
anything else for you Tim for little

823
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:49,899
leaf are you guys enriching with carbon

824
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,969
dioxide yeah we capture basically all

825
00:31:49,898 --> 00:31:55,329
our fluke lab gases off of the boiler

826
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:57,190
and we pump it into basically we're a

827
00:31:55,329 --> 00:32:00,908
semi closed greenhouse so we have a

828
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:03,849
pelham wall when we have calm slurps

829
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:05,080
underneath so there's about 95 fans and

830
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:06,460
what we're doing is we're circulating

831
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:09,368
the air through the greenhouse it comes

832
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:11,259
back in and we're measuring the

833
00:32:09,368 --> 00:32:13,869
temperature in that and we're putting

834
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:15,900
the co2 in there so the co2 and

835
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:19,179
the temperature of the greenhouse is

836
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:21,100
modulated by that back wall so what'll

837
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,720
happen is when it's cool outside

838
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:24,519
we'll bring cold air in from the outside

839
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,559
mixing with the air that's coming

840
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:29,829
through the greenhouse put the co2 in

841
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:32,409
and that's because we are an NFT system

842
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:34,750
the slurps are underneath the crop so we

843
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:38,230
got nice airflow that's going through as

844
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:40,359
well as co2 you know distribution so

845
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,130
yeah we captured all the co2 and then

846
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:45,909
when we're not running the boiler we

847
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:48,900
actually buy liquid co2 and bring it in

848
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:52,570
and supplement co2 levels because it's

849
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:54,670
interesting I I heard a commercial I

850
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:57,759
have a friend who's a commercial

851
00:32:54,670 --> 00:33:00,340
greenhouse tomato grower in Canada and

852
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:03,910
he said that 50% of his energy bill can

853
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:07,509
actually be running the boilers not just

854
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:09,850
for heating but for co2 so they used a

855
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:13,440
flue gas from the boilers even on a hot

856
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:18,000
sunny day to enrich with carbon dioxide

857
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,799
yeah yes please

858
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,049
we had so team talked about the Dutch

859
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,849
industry at the beginning and we had one

860
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:26,649
of the webinars it glaze was someone

861
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:28,599
from there talking about cogeneration

862
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:31,060
hidden power and that's something that

863
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:33,369
can really help here so one of the cases

864
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:36,069
our commercial pilots Whitfield Gardens

865
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:37,750
they do buy a lot of guests so they run

866
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:39,819
the boilers and then they just generate

867
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:42,519
their own electricity all of that and if

868
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:44,049
a better prices on gas then the literacy

869
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:45,639
from the grid you can do that in some

870
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:47,769
cases according to the Dutch guys they

871
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,720
might even sell energy back to the grid

872
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:52,599
was more profitable than running the

873
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,910
green house in some cases so it's if you

874
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:58,000
have access to two cheap natural gas

875
00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:00,730
that could be one option as well then

876
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,269
that goes to your site carbon footprint

877
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:06,730
versus your out-of-sight out-of-mind

878
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:11,769
carbon footprint - right because you're

879
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:14,829
generating combustion gases on-site so

880
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:16,300
thank you for speaking to that my last

881
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:18,819
question that I want to ask before I

882
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,950
give it to the audience is in your mind

883
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,630
I want to hear from the growers - I mean

884
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:25,750
we heard a lot from kale and Erica about

885
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,470
your ideas for sort of the future of

886
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,090
green

887
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:31,509
but I still want to hear from you which

888
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:33,970
is what what does the green house of the

889
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,190
future look like does it look like what

890
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:39,668
we see today is it a taller green house

891
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:42,550
is it a green house with new covers is

892
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:45,908
it a green house that is highly

893
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:47,619
automated what does this look like speak

894
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:49,389
the automation piece I mean the biggest

895
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,980
thing that keeps growers I think Tim

896
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:53,260
will agree it's a little more automated

897
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,608
in mine but is just labor so we're

898
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,950
looking into all different types of

899
00:34:54,608 --> 00:34:59,980
robotics for tomatoes tomatoes are very

900
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:01,269
labor intensive so we require a lot of

901
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,250
employees we'll be looking at different

902
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:05,259
labor enhancing not replacing but labor

903
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,670
enhancing technologies working with a

904
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,680
couple of companies now they're

905
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,630
developing tomato picking robots and

906
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:13,179
just ways to supplement our labor force

907
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:15,010
robots can work 24 hours people can so I

908
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:17,789
think I think robotics will play a big

909
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:22,330
piece in the green house of the future

910
00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:25,570
yeah I mean we're the labor issue is

911
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:27,519
huge we're looking at so basically we

912
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:29,380
have an automated system I mean nobody

913
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:32,858
touches the lettuce at all I mean the

914
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,000
seedings automated the the gutters come

915
00:35:32,858 --> 00:35:36,579
through the kit through the greenhouse

916
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,050
it's automated comes out you saw it on

917
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:39,819
the video comes out goes straight

918
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,500
through the cutting station into the way

919
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,109
or the only people that we have working

920
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:47,019
are the packing people they you know the

921
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:49,269
next round of infrastructure that we put

922
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:52,630
in those those jobs can also be replaced

923
00:35:49,269 --> 00:35:54,400
with with further automation I think the

924
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,400
technology piece of the greenhouse

925
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,730
industry it's continuing I mean we

926
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,079
started with two and a half acres you

927
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,760
know it's just sort of like to figure

928
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,119
out you know the new system and

929
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,920
everything like I said where were

930
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:11,920
technology takers but we improved on

931
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,920
quite a bit are our vendors worked with

932
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,349
us in terms of increasing efficiencies

933
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,030
and tweaking it so we made significant

934
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:21,039
tweaks from the first greenhouse to the

935
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,810
second greenhouse and then it's even the

936
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,329
further than the next greenhouse that's

937
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:27,099
gonna be opening up in May there's the

938
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:29,799
next level on that and that's everything

939
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:31,480
from you know the glass that we bought

940
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,580
we went to a higher level diffuse glass

941
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,289
to basically our lighting algorithm we

942
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:38,500
have LEDs as well as high pressure

943
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:39,820
sodium in terms of our watering system

944
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:44,199
and our filtration systems

945
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:46,630
we've redesigned that as well and then

946
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:49,719
also as we're learning from our vertical

947
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:52,450
friends it's like okay how do you how do

948
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:54,399
you maximize the efficiencies of you

949
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:56,319
know we believe in green houses we

950
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,200
believe in doing things horizontally as

951
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,260
opposed to vertically but there are some

952
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:04,019
aspects where you can use different

953
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:07,960
layering techniques in terms of

954
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:09,519
maximizing space so yeah it's it's on

955
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,170
the the biggest thing is that there's

956
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:15,880
going to be just a lot more greenhouses

957
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:17,079
it's just it's coming and and people

958
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,430
that are doing it have been doing it for

959
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:20,650
a while and they're pretty good at it so

960
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:23,259
while our green house is on the upward

961
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:25,599
trend I mean both of you mentioned being

962
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,170
close to market but is that the whole

963
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:33,279
story

964
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:34,960
I think Tim said a lot of it's about the

965
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,210
product and just being closer to the

966
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,639
market I mean as US we're competing with

967
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,050
Mexican tomatoes which are picked I'd

968
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:43,239
put on a truck and spray with a chemical

969
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:45,910
to to ripen on the way to the US within

970
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:47,349
10 days drive so we're we can be closer

971
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:49,000
to the markets worth of one day's Drive

972
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:50,739
seventy percent of US population and we

973
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,760
can can keep them on the vine longer

974
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:53,349
they get sweeter they have more

975
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,840
nutrition and they have a longer shelf

976
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:57,699
life I mean really the product is I

977
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,150
think it's gonna drive this in the long

978
00:37:57,699 --> 00:38:02,439
run here and that's it I mean it's

979
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:05,050
product quality but it's also

980
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,940
consistency um basically with the

981
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:09,450
greenhouse you go 52 weeks out of the

982
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:12,460
year where you're pretty you're not only

983
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:14,230
delivering a high quality product but

984
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,639
it's a consistently high quality product

985
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:18,820
as opposed to our friends and field

986
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:21,609
agriculture that you know basically do a

987
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,230
very very good job but they're dependent

988
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:24,880
upon the weather so there's gonna be

989
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,530
swings in terms of seasonality there's

990
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,320
always the food safety issue that comes

991
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:31,060
up I mean you know last this past year

992
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,620
you almost could set your watch to to

993
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:34,059
the second recalls like you know the

994
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:35,529
first one was the Thanksgiving and then

995
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:39,070
almost a year did a date there was

996
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:40,870
another recall yeah so that's not going

997
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:43,960
to go and that's not going to go away so

998
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:45,400
I mean all those things basically have

999
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,079
people running towards like the

1000
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,660
greenhouse industries I think the future

1001
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:51,250
even agriculture do you guys sell well

1002
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:51,859
I'm sorry one last question I can't help

1003
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,650
myself

1004
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:58,400
do you guys sell your product on a unit

1005
00:38:54,650 --> 00:39:01,639
basis or a weight basis unit basis unit

1006
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,289
basis so the way that it works basically

1007
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:06,500
to figure out what your unit economics

1008
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:08,360
are the grocery store wants to figure

1009
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,269
out what the price point is so price

1010
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,920
points are for for packaged lettuce

1011
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:14,780
it's basically anywhere from two ninety

1012
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,490
nine to three ninety nine anything over

1013
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:19,550
four dollars is sort of like Death

1014
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:20,929
Valley if you're going to be of scale so

1015
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,160
you have to understand what the consumer

1016
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:24,289
preferences and working with the

1017
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,909
retailers so if you could get your unit

1018
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:27,440
economics where the retailer can make

1019
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:29,329
their margin at a two ninety nine to

1020
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,920
three ninety nine and then realize that

1021
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:32,420
if you have to promote you go down to a

1022
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,940
two four five and still make those

1023
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,409
margins that's how you that's the

1024
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,200
baseline of figuring out what your

1025
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:41,299
business model is I've heard that that

1026
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:42,469
can also be a driver for being close to

1027
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,300
market is that if you're selling by

1028
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:46,730
weight and not necessarily by unit and

1029
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:50,090
your and your price is dependent on the

1030
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:52,130
weight where you sell it that being

1031
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:53,960
closer to market the weight of your

1032
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,670
lettuce or your tomato or whatever is

1033
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,590
going to be higher than if you traveled

1034
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:00,619
3,000 miles for commodity based

1035
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:03,740
businesses yes okay but for the business

1036
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:05,449
that we're in it's more like a CPG a

1037
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:08,239
consumer packaged goods you're selling a

1038
00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:13,009
unit got it as opposed to pounds got it

1039
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:16,729
okay all right your turn I promise okay

1040
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:18,500
we got seven or eight minutes good

1041
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:23,360
morning so nice not to be in the hot

1042
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:25,099
seat myself so first a shameless plug

1043
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,750
for little leaf because I am a

1044
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:32,269
Massachusetts official and I have to

1045
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:35,630
support also it's delicious they were a

1046
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:37,340
little leaf family questions for you for

1047
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:40,309
the regulator's because there's at least

1048
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:43,280
one in the room if you had a wish list

1049
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:46,969
of anything that could be done

1050
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,750
legislatively a regular regulatory to

1051
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:54,909
help promote greenhouses

1052
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:56,199
what would be on that wish list we have

1053
00:40:54,909 --> 00:40:57,789
we have one big one it's got a little

1054
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:59,439
bit pie-in-the-sky but we're we're

1055
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:01,719
really trying to go after an investment

1056
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,460
tax credit similar to what was given to

1057
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:06,819
wind and solar and we saw that industry

1058
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,710
explode over past 10-15 years it was the

1059
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,880
number one job creator in the u.s.

1060
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,920
during that time and a lot of that can

1061
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,900
be pushed back to that 30% investment

1062
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,369
tax credit so that's I mean it's a big

1063
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:20,110
lift but that's that's one we're going

1064
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:22,380
after in DC I've just got a simple one

1065
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:25,329
it's like basically have USDA and FDA

1066
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:27,910
looked at greenhouse especially leafy

1067
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:29,559
green industry do a deeper dive to

1068
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:31,389
understand it so we could just do

1069
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:34,750
something as simple as put ready to eat

1070
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:36,849
on our package yeah which believe it or

1071
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:43,989
not is is a huge hurdle for us to climb

1072
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:45,730
I have a question regarding the the way

1073
00:41:43,989 --> 00:41:48,879
you're growing inside the greenhouses

1074
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:51,329
are any what's your I guess the panel's

1075
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:56,289
opinion on living soil versus all the

1076
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:58,389
bottled inputs do you see or are you

1077
00:41:56,289 --> 00:42:04,900
trying or are you going that way or are

1078
00:41:58,389 --> 00:42:08,289
you currently doing that we're going

1079
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:11,530
hydroponically in in Rockville so no

1080
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:14,050
snow living soil yes so are you asking

1081
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:18,100
rock wall versus P versus soil is that

1082
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:20,380
the question or so we started out we

1083
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:22,929
started out with a rock wall system okay

1084
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:24,340
in terms of with the NFT gutter system

1085
00:42:22,929 --> 00:42:27,279
that we were doing but we are

1086
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:29,070
transitioning over to Pete when we first

1087
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,180
started we figured that we had enough

1088
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:33,580
challenges that we were going to try

1089
00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:35,230
things for the first time we want to

1090
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:36,759
make sure that we had seed placement and

1091
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:38,769
to understand sort of like what the

1092
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:42,280
growth cycles are and and root health

1093
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:45,070
etc etc so so the rock wall was a proven

1094
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,450
entity but since then we've gotten we've

1095
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:49,950
done a lot of trials with peat so the

1096
00:42:46,449 --> 00:42:49,949
third greenhouse will be completely peat

1097
00:42:53,659 --> 00:43:00,599
hi my questions for Dave but maybe Tim

1098
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:04,320
you can answer as well the I understand

1099
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,449
part of your model was to be in Kentucky

1100
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,180
a day's drive but can you talk about

1101
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:12,389
your site selection did you work with

1102
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:14,639
your utility and on hookups or do you

1103
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:16,589
power on site yeah so we got we got

1104
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,389
lucky I'm the first site we tried to

1105
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:20,880
grow on top of a reclaimed coal mine in

1106
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:23,129
Pikeville so there's I think in the in

1107
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,220
Appalachia there's the land mass the

1108
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:28,470
size of Delaware that's been mountaintop

1109
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:29,819
removal coal mine so there's there's a

1110
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:31,769
lot of reclaimed coal mine it looked

1111
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,730
like a spectacular site - had elevation

1112
00:43:31,769 --> 00:43:34,530
everything he kind of need for a

1113
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:37,019
greenhouse the issue was differential

1114
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,980
settlement we got the geotech report

1115
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:39,840
back it's like there's no way you can

1116
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,920
build on the site there's 800 foot of

1117
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,150
fill and it's going to settle

1118
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,610
differentially and break your greenhouse

1119
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:47,400
into million pieces so that we had a

1120
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:49,980
pivot very quickly we got we just kind

1121
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,230
of got lucky on finding a great site in

1122
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,090
Morehead Kentucky so through we worked

1123
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:57,059
with everybody anybody and everybody we

1124
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:58,530
could and just found a great site we

1125
00:43:57,059 --> 00:43:59,969
spent a lot of time on on site selection

1126
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:02,430
so we have got a development team

1127
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:08,549
looking at future sites pretty much full

1128
00:44:02,429 --> 00:44:11,129
time did you want to answer that Tim -

1129
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:13,080
yeah it's yeah no I mean site selection

1130
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,700
is huge we worked with so the Masters

1131
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,579
Massachusetts Department of Development

1132
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:18,839
um and then the DAC Devin's Enterprise

1133
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:21,569
Commission the town that we were in is

1134
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,910
an old army base that the decommission

1135
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:25,980
quite a bit of the property so actually

1136
00:44:23,909 --> 00:44:27,989
the that's how we got the site but it

1137
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,090
was all working with them in terms of

1138
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:32,009
you know you have to figure out

1139
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:33,720
longitude latitude you know basically

1140
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,070
elevations you want to make sure you've

1141
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:38,009
got enough rainfall so you can capture

1142
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:41,300
water you know all all the above so it's

1143
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,300
it's a lengthy process

1144
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:50,929
I think my question is to team two you

1145
00:44:48,469 --> 00:44:53,239
mentioned about quality of letters is

1146
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:56,389
what customers are buying and when we

1147
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:58,909
talk about hydroponic or greenhouse the

1148
00:44:56,389 --> 00:45:03,559
technology has to be repeatable and

1149
00:44:58,909 --> 00:45:05,509
scalable for example one day right next

1150
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:07,460
year five acres farm

1151
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:11,090
some rich guy named West Lake and

1152
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:13,400
created 50 acres same technology and

1153
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:16,640
same quality technically he can produce

1154
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:19,369
I don't know 30 50 percent less let us

1155
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:22,099
compare yours so I guess my question is

1156
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:25,690
how do you differentiate from yourself

1157
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:29,239
from the scaling industry and also

1158
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:32,990
sustaining quality on your products well

1159
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:34,459
so appreciate the question so the first

1160
00:45:32,989 --> 00:45:35,269
thing is if you set a standard that's

1161
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:39,050
tough to meet

1162
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:40,340
I mean which sounds you know people are

1163
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:42,410
building these greenhouses and they

1164
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:45,710
think that anybody can do it is

1165
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:48,139
difficult and you've got to have I mean

1166
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:50,539
we've we've been you know tacking

1167
00:45:48,139 --> 00:45:52,069
Paulson annexed Cornell guy we've been

1168
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:54,139
the first thing you'd have to do is get

1169
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:56,990
growers I mean and in terms of getting

1170
00:45:54,139 --> 00:45:58,429
high quality growers I mean Peter our

1171
00:45:56,989 --> 00:46:00,109
grower came over from the Netherlands

1172
00:45:58,429 --> 00:46:02,000
but since then we've had a pipeline from

1173
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:04,340
Cornell bring and grad students in and

1174
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,969
training them up to full-time grower

1175
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:09,800
jobs so that's a huge investment that

1176
00:46:07,969 --> 00:46:12,559
we're taking and where you have to grow

1177
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:15,080
your own growers to begin with

1178
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:18,289
second thing is in terms of varietal

1179
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:21,349
selection figuring out what for there's

1180
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:22,880
a lot of varieties out there we were

1181
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:24,860
very fortunate to get a really good

1182
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:29,630
variety that we we've been running with

1183
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:31,250
and we just got basically we've gotten

1184
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,420
an exclusive on this we just worked a

1185
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,489
deal with the seed company to get an

1186
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,599
exclusive on the seed for the rhythm for

1187
00:46:34,489 --> 00:46:38,389
the for the area that will be

1188
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:41,210
marketing's in and then the third thing

1189
00:46:38,389 --> 00:46:44,269
is it's like bring it on competitions

1190
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:46,220
going to come I mean we're in in terms

1191
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:49,309
of where we are in the Northeast we're

1192
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:54,079
up against Gotham bright farms leaf

1193
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:56,279
farms you know competition is is the

1194
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,259
best growers going to rise to the top

1195
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:02,100
so even if you're going to be able to do

1196
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:04,590
it at scale and if the only thing you

1197
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:07,469
have to compete against me is price I

1198
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:09,420
can and I can handle that it's like

1199
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:11,429
we're working on our unit economics to

1200
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:14,519
figure out where we need to be but if we

1201
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:16,440
are in front of the consumer and meeting

1202
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:18,750
that expectation we're going to be you

1203
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,490
know the young lady ra says she goes we

1204
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:23,400
get fan mail all the time about our

1205
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:26,250
product so we've got to make sure that

1206
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,500
we're constantly constantly hammering

1207
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:33,360
that home so that the barriers of entry

1208
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:35,250
are tough thank thank you to our

1209
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,140
panelists and thank you to your

1210
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,630
questions

1211
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:39,859
