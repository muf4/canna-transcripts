IRS and and the state taxing

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,558
organizations I want to first turn this

going to let her discuss what the topics

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,159
are that everybody is facing there are

20
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:19,359
so many levels of issues in the Cannabis

21
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,640
business when it comes to taxing that

22
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,239
obviously we're not going to be able to

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,920
cover all of them afterwards after the

24
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:27,719
Q&amp;A if you have any additional questions

25

29
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,879

30
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,239
want to turn it over to

31
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,199
Elizabeth thank you Pat so a lot of

32
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,839
people feel like they should be paying

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,719
the right amount of tax in the can's

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,359
business how many feel like the IRS

35
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:50,199
actually charges you the right amount of

36
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:53,718
tax okay that's what I thought why

37
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,640
proposition or um code section 280e who

38
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:58,798
has heard of

39
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,840
280e okay uh more than I thought

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,399
actually so here here's the hint is the

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,960
IRS is saying we're going to tax you on

42
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,960
all your income and we're going to give

43
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,439
you almost no deductions so that seems

44
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,719
fair right yeah that's good that all

45
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:12,318
works so it's been a problem it's been

46
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,840
especially a problem in Colorado they've

47
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,318
been the first ones through the door uh

48
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,840
with legalization there wasn't any

49
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:18,280
guidelines there wasn't any rules they

50
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,120
could follow so they were trying to

51
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,878
claim all their business expenses like

52
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,159
normal businesses would ordinary

53
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:25,919
necessary business expenses IRS came

54
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,598
back audited them all and gave them nice

55
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,679
big tax bills disallowing most of their

56
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:33,119
expenses under 280

57
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,640
so it's been a very difficult Row in the

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,159
Cannabis industry to file a solid tax

59
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,238
return and try and insulate yourself

60
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,318
against audit follow all the rules and

61
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,959
still make the most uh profit that you

62
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:47,359
can legally so one of the things that's

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,319
difficult as a representative and as a

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,760
preparer really starts with you guys

65
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:54,518
when it comes to bookkeeping so first

66
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,878
and foremost if you hear nothing that I

67
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,840
have to say tonight I want you to hear

68
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,598
you need to be good with your

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,640
bookkeeping go get QuickBooks keep your

70
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,079
receipts you guys are paying everything

71
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,479
in in cash so they're not you don't have

72
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,440
cancelled checks to show you probably

73
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,280
don't have credit card receipts to show

74
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,439
it really Falls to you guys to make sure

75
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,360
that you create as strong as wall as you

76
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,439
can for the expenses that are out there

77
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,120
and with the money that you're putting

78
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,359
out the IRS will push and they'll poke

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,480
and they'll look for holes to try to

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,319
raise your tax liability so the first

81
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,039
line of defense starts with your

82
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:26,039
business practice so if you don't have a

83
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,519
bookkeeper you're not good at

84
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,719
bookkeeping find one go get QuickBooks

85
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:33,039
get a scanner for your re seips be ready

86
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,759
to go CU really that's your first best

87
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,519
shot at moving forward so when it comes

88
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,919
to Preparing the taxes there are a lot

89
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,360
of people I've noticed after going to

90
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,199
the conference last week who are

91
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,239
representing themselves as experts in

92
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,598
the field they've heard of 28e so they

93
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,360
must know everything be ready to go good

94
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,039
to go don't take it at face value I

95
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,840
heard a lot of misinformation coming

96
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:53,719
through on that conference so do your

97
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,000
due diligence make sure that person's

98
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:58,438
been in the industry really vet them let

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,079
them explain back to you what 280 is

100
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,799
have them explain back to you what sort

101
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,799
of expenses they can and cannot take if

102
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,560
it sounds too good to be true it's too

103
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,079
good to be true so that's what you want

104
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,640
to walk away with right there uh the

105
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,599
other thing question I get asked quite a

106
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,839
bit is why should I even file I'm a Cash

107
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:17,680
and Carry business let them find me uh I

108
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,160
can tell you chances are at some point

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,798
they will so when you don't file you

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,919
really open the door for the IRS to come

111
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,039
in and say you didn't file this year

112
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,719
we're going to go ahead and do that for

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,720
you and now you owe us a lot of money

114
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,960
thank you so then the impetus is back on

115
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,560
you to say no no no I don't owe you all

116
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,239
that that's not what I owe you I had

117
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,399
expenses I did that now you're on the

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,280
defense now you got to some prove their

119
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,198
numbers wrong and show your

120
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,519
documentation and hope that you have a

121
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,680
good representative you get in there and

122
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,918
get some relief but you've really

123
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,879
relinquished the wheel to the IRS

124
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,680
they're were the ones who are going to

125
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,918
come in and tell you how much you owe

126
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,600
you file a tax return you're the one

127
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,240
driving let them prove you wrong let

128
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,919
them come forward and audit now we know

129
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,918
the Cannabis industry is getting hit

130
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,599
pretty hard in the audit World numbers

131
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,399
anywhere from 12% to 20 % of people

132
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,400
filing in the Cannabis industry are

133
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,839
going to get audited so these good

134
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,079
practices are get you in a position

135
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,319
where you're going to be less exposed

136
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,199
than other people who aren't following

137
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,759
some pretty basic things but if you

138
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,759
don't file you really do open the door

139
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,639
to the IRS to go ahead and do that for

140
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,199
you on top of that once they start

141
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,759
looking you don't file for one year you

142
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,639
don't file for two years now they're

143
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,520
looking at a lot of years now they're

144
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,319
looking at returns you maybe did file

145
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,159
before you were in the Cannabis industry

146
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,879
now they're really crawling up your uh

147
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,439
tax life with a microscope looking for

148
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,879
money they can find so these are some

149
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,360
very important things when it comes to

150
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,038
the decision whether or not to file the

151
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,240
next step IRS can take is criminal

152
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,719
investigation so people in the Cannabis

153
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,840
industry federal government looking in

154
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,360
on a criminal level doesn't sound good

155
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,359
just sounds like a bad idea so if you

156
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,000
can take those steps get some good

157
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,800
bookkeeping behind you get a good

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,680
preparer file your returns you are

159
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,199
really in a much stronger position than

160
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,038
if you just duck under the covers and

161
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,038
hope they don't find you eventually they

162
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:01,959
will

163
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:04,719
so that's some of the big questions I

164
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:06,839
have out there thank you Elizabeth I

165
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,960
want to talk about something a little

166
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,560
different that you need to be the

167
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:15,598
questions you need to be asking your

168
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,280
practitioners okay you will all need CPA

169
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:21,279
you will all need tax attorneys I I

170
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:24,719
can't emphasize enough what Elizabeth

171
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:28,559
said about people holding themselves up

172
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,360
as experts in this industry that can be

173
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,038
catastrophic for you as a company if you

174
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,000
don't have the right attorney if you

175
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:38,000
don't have the right tax practitioner

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,720
you're going to open yourself up to

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,319
brutal penalties the penalties can be as

178
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,000
high as almost

179
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,160
50% uh it'll wipe you out it's as simple

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,959
as that what I want to talk about though

181
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,120
is you don't need to be afraid of the

182
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:57,279
IRS you do not need to be afraid of your

183
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,840
state taxation uh organizations all

184
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,598
right like Elizabeth said if if you keep

185
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,918
meticulous books just do what your

186
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:08,240
practitioner tells you to do we set up a

187
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:10,918
lot of clients with a bookkeeping system

188
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,720
okay if you do that you're almost at a

189
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:14,839
point where you you welcome the audit

190
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,120
because the government's not going to

191
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,560
bother you they're going to audit you

192
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,160
and they're going to see how meticulous

193
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,360
you are and you don't have to worry

194
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:25,000
about that okay everybody uh with regard

195
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,360
to some people are going to get in

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,839
trouble okay they just are and even when

197
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,960
you do it could be simply a bookkeeping

198
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,519
mistake it could be you miss filing uh

199
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:38,878
anything from a 1099 to a W2 whatever it

200
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:42,439
is some people are going to get in

201
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,759
trouble okay and I I want to preface the

202
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:47,800
second part of this by explaining and

203
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:52,800
your practitioners should know this

204
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:55,439
okay the IRS is a business okay the IRS

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,319
gets their funding from the federal

206
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:02,319
government okay federal government gives

207
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:05,680
x amount of dollars to the IRS all right

208
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,919
the IRS has a a numerous amount of

209
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,280
Divisions they've got the collections

210
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:13,519
they've got offering compromise they've

211
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:15,638
got a whole bunch of them okay each one

212
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:19,359
of those divisions has a supervisor and

213
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:22,720
they're all allocated money from the pot

214
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,280
so to speak okay well like any good

215
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:31,039
business they get audited themselves

216
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:33,240
okay and they need to be making a profit

217
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,319
okay just like any other business or

218
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,240
they go out of business or supervisor's

219
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,200
head roles whatever it is just like any

220
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,519
other business okay the government

221
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,320
there's an organization called the

222
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,879
taxpayer Advocate all right and they're

223
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,080
a wonderful source of tax information

224
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:49,399
for those that don't have a problem or

225
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,440
just want to get some information

226
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:56,799
there's sort of a watchdog in essence

227
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,240
too for the IRS and uh what they'll do

228
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,599
for example is a recent study that came

229
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,560
came out they found out that three out

230
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,040
of five Revenue officers will give three

231
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,559
different answers to the same exact

232
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,838
question so these are these are

233
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:16,479
treacherous Waters sometimes with the

234
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,880
IRS also they did uh a recent study the

235
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,720
government is making the IRS is making

236
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:25,278
$7 on every dollar they invest in going

237
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,120
after you as a taxpayer that's a hell of

238
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,159
a profit okay any business out there

239
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,078
would be happy asell with three or four

240
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,480
to one on their investment what does

241
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:37,679
that mean to you as a practitioner okay

242
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,200
280 is a big deal cost of goods not

243
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,159
being allowed it's a it's a big deal

244
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,519
okay so there are very few writeoffs

245
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:49,199
but if you do get on it in as a

246
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,560
practitioner this is the reality they're

247
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,519
a business okay you start cutting into

248
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,719
their

249
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,159
profit you're going to have a lot more

250
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,680
power in negotiating a settlement what I

251
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:03,439
mean by that is if you get audited this

252
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:05,319
is a a generalistic approach to when you

253
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,640
get audited you get paperwork it says

254
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,120
they're disallowing could be anything

255
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:11,838
could be uh any kind of expense

256
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,959
whatsoever you can think of entertaining

257
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,320
fuel

258
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,359
whatever you go through the audit all

259
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,000
right once you a and I strongly

260
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,039
recommend you have somebody do it for

261
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,278
you check them out make sure they have

262
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:29,639
the credentials you have the right to

263
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:32,240
know how many or close to clients your

264
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,439
practitioner actually handled in the

265
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,600
Cannabis industry ask questions okay so

266
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,200
if you get audited what's going to

267
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,360
happen is you go through the audit they

268
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,720
come back with a what's called a

269
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,919
4549 that's the assessment they're

270
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:51,120
saying Elizabeth you owe us

271
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:52,559
$100,000 okay now if a practitioner's

272
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,120
been involved in the industry they'll

273
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,319
know that since this is a business you

274
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,720
want to make it difficult okay that's

275
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,800
one thing I want to emphasize do do not

276
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,920
worry about fighting the IRS you're not

277
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:08,838
going to end up on some no fly list okay

278
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:10,199
because you fought the IRS it's not

279
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:11,560
going to happen okay you got too many

280
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,278
people they have too many people to go

281
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:16,838
after I think the most recent

282
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,320
calculation is somewhere around 450

283
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:22,639
billion is it that the government is

284
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,399
trying to collect okay yeah it's the

285
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:29,120
size of the uh uh uh uh revenue of an

286
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,720
entire country so what you want to do is

287
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,600
after that audit original assessment you

288
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,160
want to fight it okay this is when it

289
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,920
starts getting really interesting to the

290
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,958
IRS okay because they have to do the

291
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,479
whole audit all over again okay it goes

292
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,159
to an appeals officer they have to do

293
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,200
the whole thing all over again what do

294
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,120
you think that

295
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,959
means it's cutting into the profit it's

296
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,320
work that the IRS has to do all over

297
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:58,239
again so typically our experience has

298
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,879
been that the appeals officer with no

299
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,480
additional

300
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,600
documentation at all because it's a

301
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,759
substantiation case essentially I spent

302
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,759
this much you're saying I don't get

303
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,799
credit for that whatever with no

304
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,399
additional information our experience

305
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,319
has been that you can get like 20%

306
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,240
knocked off just simply because you took

307
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,320
it to the next level you don't stop

308
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,480
there okay what you do is what we do for

309
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,519
our clients and what other practitioners

310
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,399
do for their clients that have been

311
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,799
doing this for a while is they'll file a

312
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:33,078
tax Court petition okay okay that goes

313
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:36,599
to a bunch of

314
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:39,799
lawyers at the IRS okay the district

315
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,560
council division is is attorneys that

316
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:44,519
handle Tax Court okay once you get

317
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,799
lawyers involved you're seriously

318
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,720
seriously cutting in to the profit

319
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,399
margin of the IRS and typically on

320
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,800
substantiation cases you now have

321
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,600
$100,000 debt has been knocked down to

322
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:56,240
say

323
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,759
$80,000

324
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,120
okay the attorneys are typically will be

325
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,439
first of all they're they're overwhelmed

326
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,799
okay I can't figure this one out but the

327
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,920
government their number one Revenue

328
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,679
producer they've cut their budget every

329
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:15,360
year for I think three straight years

330
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:18,000
now which makes the revenue officers

331
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,399
very cranky because they have much

332
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,879
larger case loads than they've ever had

333
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,198
I still haven't figured that one out why

334
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,039
they're doing it whatever once you get

335
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:28,359
to tax court because they're so

336
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:31,000
overwhelmed what happens is these are

337
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,320
substan iation cases these the district

338
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,240
council for the most part is not

339
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,800
interested in substantiation cases

340
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,120
they'd be more interested if Elizabeth

341
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:40,958
had a tax shelter in in Bolivia or

342
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,120
something like that that's a lot of work

343
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,078
there's typically a lot of money

344
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,039
involved so on and so forth okay so

345
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:49,399
they'll typically go back to the appeals

346
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,719
officer and say we don't want to deal

347
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:55,198
with Elizabeth we want nothing to do

348
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,920
with Elizabeth make a deal and we've had

349
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,559
at times over 50% of the original

350
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:03,000
assessment wiped out simply because they

351
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,039
want to settle because there are

352
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,879
millions of taxpayers out there that are

353
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,039
willing to fall on their sword okay

354
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:11,759
they're willing they're they're

355
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,198
terrified of the IRS so if the IRS comes

356
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,120
back with an assessment they figure

357
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:18,198
they're screwed and there's nothing they

358
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,480
can do about it okay you need and this

359
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:24,599
is without a single additional piece of

360
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,920
evidence that says we're able to justify

361
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,920
so it is a game I know I'd love to think

362
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:31,679
I've got a bunch of attorneys and and

363
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:34,000
CPAs and everything there is there is a

364
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,958
bit of a game to this and if you don't

365
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,958
have like Elizabeth said you must have

366
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,198
practitioners who know what they're

367
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:44,359
doing okay for you to take advantage of

368
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:48,240
that so I'm going to suggest that you

369
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,800
strongly fight each and every situation

370
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,839
you get into if we if you don't get rid

371
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,039
of the entire amount that's owed and you

372
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,079
have to get set up on a payment plan

373
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:00,039
people typically try to do it on their

374
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:01,919
own they don't realize realize that

375
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:03,958
there are things like the IRS code and

376
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,719
the IRS manual individually are thicker

377
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:10,638
than the Bible okay they don't realize

378
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:14,000
as as lay people that there are there

379
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,919
are there are uh statutes in the code

380
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,720
and in the manual There are rules that

381
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:23,078
say that if Elizabeth ran into a problem

382
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,360
say physical or there there's only about

383
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:27,120
eight of them they call them reasonable

384
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,560
cause arguments she can have all her

385
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,360
penalties abated

386
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:35,838
okay the typical person doesn't know

387
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,639
that okay so what you need to have is

388
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,800
someone who knows that law because if

389
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:43,159
she's entitled to get rid of penalties

390
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,879
if she doesn't you're looking at like I

391
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:49,278
said sometimes as high as

392
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,639
50% on your assessment now the thing is

393
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,198
you might say to yourself and I'm kind

394
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,519
of Happy the IRS doesn't do this the IRS

395
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,559
for the most part knows their own rules

396
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,278
and regulations but there's been a lot

397
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,318
of controversy I know you guys have

398
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:02,759
probably seen it on the

399
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:06,198
internet essentially Revenue officers

400
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:08,079
their careers are contingent upon how

401
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,719
much money they bring in and how quickly

402
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,000
they bring it in so do you think they're

403
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,278
going to tell you Elizabeth that you

404
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,039
don't have to pay penalties because you

405
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:18,720
went through a divorce or you know you

406
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,120
became very ill and that's what led to

407
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,879
the problem so get I'm going to I'm

408
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,919
going to leave you with this make sure

409
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,639
and we can't emphasize this enough it it

410
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:32,679
it really you know the IR s is is kind

411
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:35,198
of organizations like ours if they just

412
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:37,000
follow their own rules and their own

413
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,318
regulations I probably wouldn't be

414
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,440
standing here because they're we're the

415
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:45,559
ones that say no you got to follow the

416
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:49,360
rules okay so I want to leave you with

417
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:51,758
that that please fight them please get

418
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,600
representation okay we're not the only

419
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,079
game in town we've been doing this we're

420
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,199
a crossover industry like like Lisa

421
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,359
mentioned we've been doing taxes getting

422
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,958
people out of trouble setting them up on

423
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,199
payment plans whatever for 25 years but

424
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:08,438
there are other companies out there I

425
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,240
just implore you to do your research you

426
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:14,038
are entitled to ask questions this is

427
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,400
your financial life you do not need to

428
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:19,199
be afraid of the IRS ask a lot of

429
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,199
questions thank

430
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,759
you

431
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,879
question so if I'm a cannabis business

432
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:29,839
we all know that we have a hard time

433
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,559
getting banking so a lot of the money I

434
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,639
might take in is going to be in the form

435
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:36,440
of cash what do I need to be aware of

436
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,038
when it comes to the IRS when I'm taking

437
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,720
those cash pay cash payments 8300 yes

438
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:46,440
you want to be aware of form 8,300 right

439
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,919
so when you have $10,000 $11 cash that

440
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,160
you're depositing that you're moving

441
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:53,400
there's an IRS report uh 8,300 that

442
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,480
you're going to fill out and they're

443
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,360
going to find your social security

444
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,120
number they're going to want to know the

445
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,319
source of the income they're going to be

446
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,399
watching so there's a trigger number not

447
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,038
not 10,000 10,000 one they're going to

448
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,080
start to require these returns and those

449
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:05,960
are going to be reviewed it might take

450
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,720
them a year to get to it they don't do

451
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,720
anything very quickly but they're very

452
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,079
diligent you can't stop them either So

453
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,200
eventually they'll start looking into

454
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,960
that so you want to make sure that you

455
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,120
have your documentation to support the

456
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,600
source of those funds what if I have

457
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:21,119
them come in and pay 5,000 on Tuesday

458
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:22,599
and 5,000 and one on Thursday now

459
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,199
there's going to be an aggregate review

460
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:25,240
so you can't you can't stack them up

461
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,319
like that they're going to start looking

462
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,519
for patterns they're going to start

463
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,200
finding them you're not going to hide

464
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,639
that way sorry it's another thing

465
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,080
another thing I want to add to that when

466
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,000
you I actually know a a banker with a

467
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,519
huge bank here in California that

468
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,480
they're literally smelling the money

469
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:47,319
when it comes in okay and if it's less

470
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,200
than 10 you've got an 8,300 requirement

471
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:53,879
but they're so paranoid about it's

472
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,640
illegal to schedule one drug okay

473
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,000
they're FDIC insured they don't want to

474
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,960
be audited themselves they've gone at

475
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,599
times and reported there's a

476
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,200
organization bear with me I'll be 57 in

477
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:10,038
a couple days I think it's called sin

478
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:13,319
it's the financial sinfin thank you

479
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:15,879
sinfin is a is the Criminal Division

480
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:18,960
that's where that money gets reported to

481
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,640
so if you're not filing it if you're not

482
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,759
filling out that form and they catch up

483
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,000
to you you're in a lot of you know

484
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,240
you're in a lot of trouble it's as

485
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,679
simple as that let me add one more thing

486
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,640
about banking banking is critically

487
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,960
important to this industry so in

488
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,038
California we're not looking at banks

489
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,600
that want to embrace us at this point in

490
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:39,240
some of the other states where they've

491
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,798
decriminalized especially uh uh Colorado

492
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,880
there are some banks that are coming up

493
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,440
and they're willing to deal with these

494
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,880
on a limited basis five six banks that I

495
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,240
know of that are actually being

496
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,760
proactive and getting involved in the

497
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,519
community the difference between

498
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:52,119
Colorado and California right now is the

499
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,000
lack of Regulation as far as the banking

500
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:55,879
is concerned so we expect to see some

501
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,319
regulation in California around the

502
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,559
beginning of 2018 and at that point we

503
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,079
really do expect Banks locally to start

504
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,798
looking to this industry because they

505
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,678
they not only smell the money they can

506
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:07,918
smell the money so you know they're

507
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:09,600
they're out there they want your

508
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,080
business but they want to make sure that

509
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,599
they stay clean along the process and

510
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:15,158
not get criminally investigated for

511
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:18,119
laundering money so that is help is

512
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,280
coming okay next question uh real quick

513
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,558
Sor under

514
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:25,879
280e um having a collective Cooperative

515
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,759
cost of goods better to be on

516
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,679
consignment that's a pretty specific

517
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,038
question I I'd have to look at those to

518
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,679
be a little bit I need to see how that's

519
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:33,960
set up to be able to intelligent I'm a

520
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:39,080
lawyer so I'm going to hedge that and

521
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,120
say it depends okay that's we yeah I

522
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:41,319
mean that that's a pretty specific

523
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,119
scenario so that's something we should

524
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:44,720
talk I mean under consignment it's it's

525
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,119
the cost of goods is actually a little

526
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,038
bit different being a collective or

527
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:50,558
cooperative so the cost to good because

528
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:52,759
you have a member based situation there

529
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,399
so you can write write off just the

530
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,038
profit or that sale and pay it back to

531
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,320
the member from what I understanding I

532
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:01,240
want to say something about 280

533
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,480
interesting you know because we stay up

534
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,079
as as you know as much as we can on

535
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,440
what's going on obviously that's why we

536
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:11,558
do the business we do I've

537
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,038
had it's kind of interesting

538
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:18,720
dispensaries you have Bud tenders okay

539
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:23,319
and you've got cash register people all

540
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:26,759
right you can argue if you're doing a

541
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:30,720
medical consult consultation okay

542
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:35,759
medical all right you can argue that

543
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:38,839
that consultation between you and I is a

544
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:43,240
consultant so you can try to write off

545
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:47,000
part of that okay however if you walk

546
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,880
over to the cash register you better not

547
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,558
try to write it off because you're

548
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:57,039
dealing drugs okay you are hand toand TR

549
00:21:52,558 --> 00:22:00,200
transaction of a class schedule one drug

550
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:03,599
so this is another reason why you need

551
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,120
to know about the person who's handling

552
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:09,558
your case and I'm going to give you use

553
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:12,119
that use that little example and see

554
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:13,720
what your practitioner says if they're

555
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,959
like looking at you like oh no

556
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,839
everything are right off or whatever

557
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,440
they don't know what the hell they're

558
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:22,399
talking about so another thing I wanted

559
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,159
to bring out this industry is becoming

560
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,960
regulated in essence by the tax Court

561
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:28,640
okay there's a lot of stuff out there

562
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,720
that's going to come down

563
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,278
that hopefully is going to change the

564
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,839
game so it's exciting to see what next

565
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:35,839
year looks

566
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:43,079
like uh hi so um what if um uh okay I

567
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,079
have two questions two quick questions

568
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:47,798
actually okay say say your company is

569
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:50,918
just CBD how does that affect the

570
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:52,200
banking in uh in California it's still

571
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:55,038
going to be you're still going to be in

572
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,798
trouble not title it's not the no it's

573
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:57,960
not it's not you're still handling the

574
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:58,798
plant this is still going to be the

575
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,278
class one you're still going to be

576
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,519
looking at the same roles hi mine's more

577
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:05,798
um I'm a a brand so I have a lot of

578
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:08,480
manufacturing cost of packaging and that

579
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:11,480
sort of thing what do I do with that

580
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,880
because of the 280e what how how do I

581
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,798
actually manufacturing isn't so bad The

582
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,278
Growers manufacturers have a lot more

583
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:17,558
they can include under cost of good sold

584
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:21,200
than the dispensary owners you're going

585
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:23,678
to find really so and are you taking new

586
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,880
clients we'll talk

587
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,519
later do you have a

588
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,240
question I went to the convention and I

589
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,960
had the same Pro um question there that

590
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:38,000
I have here and that is with the banking

591
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:41,679
is in problem with the uh with this

592
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,240
industry where do you go to bank right

593
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,200
now you don't honestly I mean the best

594
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,440
answer I got again from that conference

595
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,240
from somebody I very much respect was

596
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,000
basically I mean there are some agencies

597
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,759
that will help you find Banks perhaps

598
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,839
outside of California certainly still in

599
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,480
the United States just to be clear um so

600
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:59,798
there are there are some some Industries

601
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,519
there are some people in this industry

602
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:02,839
who will help you find banking but as

603
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,400
far as walking into somewhere in

604
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,759
California to open a bank account we're

605
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,278
not quite there yet okay then what would

606
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:12,798
you suggest people do since they can't

607
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:14,798
get a bank in California they go where

608
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:17,720
well it's kind of uh it's kind of a

609
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:20,440
tricky question for us to it's kind of a

610
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:23,159
tricky question to for us to kind of

611
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,519
imply like you should do something maybe

612
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,320
you shouldn't

613
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:31,359
do not a good thing for us to do

614
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:35,798
we have lawyers and CPAs who have

615
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:38,798
licenses and but I guarantee you this

616
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:41,759
there is somebody in this room that is

617
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:44,839
using a particular Bank some banks will

618
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:46,759
charge you a huge fee in order to do

619
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:49,959
this uh there Bank in Massachusetts

620
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:51,440
charging like $55,000 a month to service

621
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,960
your account because they're hiring

622
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:58,320
compliance officers to make sure you're

623
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:00,038
not Manuel Nora I just dated myself

624
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,439
okay who's the most recent drug dealer

625
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:04,480
that got busted Pablo Escobar no still

626
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,120
dating

627
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:12,159
myself El Chapo El

628
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:13,959
Chapo anyway so you know you got because

629
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,640
that that's that was the whole point of

630
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,000
280e you got to remember the intention

631
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,360
much like the bank secrecy act Bank

632
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,558
secrecy Act is something I'd like to

633
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,319
touch on in a second real quickly but

634
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:31,119
remember it was intended to feret out

635
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:33,678
criminals okay the IRS still looks at us

636
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,158
as criminals in essence because it's

637
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,399
still a schedule one we have no idea

638
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,919
what's going to happen with the two

639
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:42,519
candidates either one of them Hillary

640
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,759
has been against it from way back when

641
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:47,398
she's she softened her stance because

642
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,879
guess what you guys are out there

643
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:53,359
lobbying you guys are proving that this

644
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:56,440
is an industry you guys are proving that

645
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:59,719
this is safer just be I mean Colorado

646
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,360
has shown a a reduction in serious

647
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,360
crimes since cannabis became legal so

648
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:05,359
the evidence is out

649
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:13,798
there and you guys I'm sorry you guys

650
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:16,079
through all the networking women grow

651
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,319
are making a difference so candidates

652
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,759
need to sit up and take notice and that

653
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,759
that's what's

654
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:26,079
happening I have a question and a

655
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,120
comment um because the Dodd Frank act

656
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:33,319
which is the you know follow the cash is

657
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:35,918
really it's 8,300 is in for the entire

658
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,960
year it's not per transaction which I

659
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,799
learned by error because I was in the

660
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:44,399
diamond business so if I have a deposit

661
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:47,599
from the same client and it was 5,000

662
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:50,959
8,000 regardless it's 10,000 for the

663
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:53,240
year from vendor one which I don't think

664
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,278
you were clear on that for the 8300 AB

665
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,679
that's a very good point so you can do

666
00:26:55,278 --> 00:27:01,440
you know 9900 multiple times but it's

667
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:03,080
per client per annual Year and that

668
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,558
wasn't clarified that's one of that's

669
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:08,278
one of one of the you know this is deep

670
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:11,200
stuff there's a lot of intricacies that

671
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:13,319
afterwards we can discuss tax managers

672
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,798
and whatnot will look at that they'll

673
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:19,599
specifically look right away okay did

674
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:21,440
you have a $5,500 cash deposit last week

675
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,839
two weeks later it's a

676
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,600
$3,300 cash it's all

677
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,839
cash you know you have to you have to

678
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:29,959
you're you're you're absolutely Ely

679
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:33,398
correct another thing you didn't mention

680
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,960
is I was a compliance officer and I was

681
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:37,759
unfortunately or fortunately I'm not

682
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,640
sure yet um I do suggest if you guys

683
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,158
don't have compliance officers in your

684
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,880
business yes put one person in charge of

685
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,960
compliance it makes your life a lot

686
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,159
easier to follow one person is

687
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,679
responsible for dodf Frank but the other

688
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,760
thing which is actually the question I I

689
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,080
have banking relationships with a small

690
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:56,679
bank and I've been very fortunate and

691
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,079
I've heard many people in different

692
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,200
parts of California

693
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,839
working with a small bank but then I was

694
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,278
just told that a um well they're not

695
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:08,240
Savings and Loan anymore they're Credit

696
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:11,319
Unions sorry I'm dating myself um so

697
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,240
Credit Unions thoughts versus a bank I

698
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:14,558
got to tell you something it's

699
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,000
interesting you bring up Credit Unions

700
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:20,720
there is I I don't want to call it

701
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,919
Scuttle but that California is going to

702
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:27,079
create their own Credit Unions for the

703
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:29,759
Cannabis industry so that's 2018 we're

704
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:32,519
looking at so in the interim you have to

705
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,960
comply with the law are you're you're

706
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:38,880
you're opening yourself up to a lot of

707
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,519
problems and huge huge what you said I

708
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,000
thought we had emphasized that you must

709
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,919
get people who know what they're doing

710
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,720
Lisa will tell you from City to City

711
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,679
County to County the rules are different

712
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,319
you know you got States I mean cities

713
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,080
that like to flex their muscles and say

714
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:56,759
no I'm not going to let that many

715
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:58,720
dispensaries in well you need to know

716
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,839
those things because a lot of money to

717
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,120
start a dispensary a lot of money to get

718
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:06,639
invested in this industry but I want to

719
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,000
also say I heard someone talking at the

720
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,840
Washington

721
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,798
Convention and they were on a panel and

722
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:15,639
I thought it was a little irresponsible

723
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:18,759
they were hammering away at how much

724
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,159
money it cost to get into this industry

725
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:23,879
and I had the distinct feeling it was

726
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,919
about them wanting to limit the

727
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:30,278
competition this is a great industry to

728
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:32,360
get into it's a very profitable industry

729
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:36,319
no doubt about it I'll share a little

730
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:38,359
story with you about craft Foods okay

731
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,879

732
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:44,278
corporate America craft foods from what

733
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,640
I've been told has established a

734
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:51,599
separate marketing division to deal with

735
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,960

736
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,639
