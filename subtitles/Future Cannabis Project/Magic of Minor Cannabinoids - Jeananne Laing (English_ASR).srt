2
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,119
myling

3
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,119
[Music]

[Music]

6
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,759
what I'm going to do is hopefully

7
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,400
inspire you to start experimenting with

8
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,560
the minor

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,478
canabo um because we don't know what we

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,960
don't know and there's so much to learn

11
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:18,079
and there's so much um combinations we

12
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,640
talk about the Entourage effect right

13
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,798
and we always think about the Entourage

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,400
effect as THC in the Turpin or CBD in

15
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,640
the tpin OR THC and CBD and the

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,000
tpin but that's just a tiny tiny little

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,478
bit there's over 100 probably a lot more

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,478
than that right now but I'll stick with

19
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:39,560
a 100 uh canabo that have been

20
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:42,280
identified so far in the canvas plant

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,478
the one thing I like to um because I'm a

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,118
herbalist at heart and all plants I

23
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:48,519
don't like to play favorites but

24
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,959
currently at this part of my career I'm

25
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:53,879
playing a favorite but uh I like to

26
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:56,478
think of cannabis as the Gateway herb

27
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,679
because it's the plant that has been

28
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,599
studied the most for its medicinal

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,600
properties honestly no other plant has

30
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,919
been studied as much as cannabis has now

31
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:10,439
a lot of that studying the clinical

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,560
studies that happened through uh the 80s

33
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:16,359
and the 90s and the early

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,800
2000s the only way in North America that

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,280
you could legally study cannabis was to

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,519
prove how dangerous it was so all of

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,439
these clinical studies happened to try

38
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,400
and prove how dangerous canvas was and

39
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,318
it wasn't and so all of that studies are

40
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,519
sitting on a shelf

41
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:38,479
somewhere um which is kind of fun to

42
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,920
think about but during all those studies

43
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,799
people were going like wait a minute

44
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,318
this isn't dangerous at all look at this

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,360
guy's he doesn't have so much pain this

46
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,799
this person isn't has doesn't have so

47
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,440
much nausea this guy's not so anxious

48
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,879
anymore right so we're starting to get

49
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:55,359
these little hints at like wait a minute

50
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,399
somebody's trying to pull the wool over

51
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,080
our eyes here so

52
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,920
um we all know know that canabo just a

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,319
little review canabo in the plant itself

54
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:11,399
are in an acidic form so thca Tetra

55
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,079
hydroc canabidol sorry

56
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,680
tetrahydrocannabinolic

57
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,719
acid canabidol

58
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,760
cannabidiolic acid I make my students

59
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:23,479
learn how to S

60
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:27,598
these um but even before we get to the

61
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:31,759
THC in the CBD we have canaberal

62
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:34,479
CBG actually we have canab geric acid

63
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:37,759
cbga that's the mam canapino

64
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,399
or in not so folksy terms a little more

65
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,039
scientific terms you could call it the

66
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,920
stem cell or the the original

67
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:46,840
cannabinoid as the plant starts to grow

68
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:50,359
and just as those flowers are starting

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:54,120
to take form we have canaberal very

70
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,799
briefly shows up so canaberal alic acid

71
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,920
very very briefly shows up and then the

72
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:05,239
CBG cbga technically will morph if you

73
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,919
will through the work of enzymes into

74
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,239
whatever the genetics of the plant are

75
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:13,518
so if it's a high THC plant that THC

76
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:17,720
starts out as cbga right if it's a high

77
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,879
cbda plant that CBD first at one point

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,919
was CBG

79
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:25,399
so we could Harvest those flowers early

80
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,359
really early but if you're a grower

81
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:30,719
you're going like don't Harvest it at

82
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,280
the wrong time um but but we could also

83
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,240
create genetics that manipulates the

84
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:41,439
enzymes so that those enzymes stop the

85
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:45,240
CBG from morphing into something else so

86
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:48,600
then we can have high CBG plants right

87
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:53,918
and with that CBG wow is that ever a

88
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:56,680
great uh canono so we have our our raw

89
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:59,918
cannabinoids uh the acidic form and then

90
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:04,199
we have what's been called up until

91
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:06,359
recently the activated form so THC CBD

92
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,038
and you get your activated form by

93
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,280
heating up the Cannabis and that knocks

94
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:15,360
off chemically knocks off the acidic

95
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:18,719
molecule so then we're left with what

96
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,720
has up until now be called activated but

97
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:26,360
we're starting to understand that

98
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,400
cbda is pretty darn special thca is

99
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,240
pretty darn special we don't have to

100
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,038
heat our plants up

101
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,160
but what we can do is we can start to

102
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:38,318
have combinations of acidic and heated

103
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,919
acidic and activated together and we'll

104
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,560
start to see I'm going to give you a few

105
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:45,079
stats here of how um some of the things

106
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,720
that we're starting to learn about the

107
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:50,359
acidic form of plants plus some of those

108
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,319
minor canabo and if you're a breeder a

109
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,038
cultivator and you like to play around

110
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,160
with genetics see if you can start

111
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:57,318
playing around like read up on I don't

112
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,800
know how to I don't know how to tell you

113
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,120
how to do that I'm not a grower but uh

114
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,280
see if you can start playing around with

115
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,399
some of those minor canabo and move them

116
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:10,679
up so that we can get um other strains I

117
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,439
know there is a uh there's a little bit

118
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,439
of CBG starting to show up in the retail

119
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,598
market and there's a little bit of CBC

120
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,519
canaby chroming starting to show up but

121
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:21,519
I'll talk about that one in a

122
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:27,680
minute so phyto canabo we have four

123
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,840
types of cannaboids I don't know if you

124
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,598
guys knew that we have phyto canabo from

125
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:37,198
the plant we have endoc canabo those are

126
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:40,519
the canabo that our body makes we have

127
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,598
um synthetic canono that was the only

128
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:47,318
thing that you could legally study in

129
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:50,319
the United States for decades synthetic

130
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:53,319
canabo they're made in the lab they

131
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,680
mimic the ones that we find in the plant

132
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,840
however they're super po potent and so

133
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,079
some of the studies that we have about

134
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,679
THC

135
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,878
especially from the ' 80s and 90s that

136
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,240
research was done with synthetic

137
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:10,840
cannabinoids which is can be dangerous

138
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,400
because it is so concentrated and so if

139
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:16,478
you see a study that says THC is

140
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:18,279
dangerous it caused psychotic breaks it

141
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,800
might have even caused death it could

142
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,679
have caused high anxiety not that the

143
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,079
plant THC doesn't do some of those

144
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,000
things doesn't cause death but it can do

145
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:30,439
induce anxiety and those kinds of things

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,240
but look at the study go dig into the

147
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:35,719
study and if it if the material that

148
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,720
they were using was

149
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,160
hu212 that's synthetic THC right so you

150
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,159
have to look into the study and see what

151
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,120
kind of THC were they using was it from

152
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:50,439
a plant or was it from a laboratory now

153
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,000
we have a new kind of canabo that's

154
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,759
going to be coming out on the market if

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,598
it's not out already probably start out

156
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,879
in California it's where they're doing

157
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,719
some research and it's called

158
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,039
biosynthetic cannaboids biosyn syntic

159
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,159
cannaboids are grown in the same way

160
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:05,519
that probiotics are grown you know the

161
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:07,639
probiotics that you buy at your health

162
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,799
food store they're grown usually on

163
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,680
yeast and then uh once they're grown the

164
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,800
the yeast is extracted so you're just

165
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,759
left with the probiotics so there are

166
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,918
companies that are starting to grow

167
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,158
biosynthetic

168
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:23,959
canono don't feel threatened if you're a

169
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:25,079
grower it's okay there's room for it all

170
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,120
but one of the things about the

171
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:30,000
biosynthetic is it's not in a laboratory

172
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,759
so it's a little bit more natural but

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,599
we're going to be able to Target those

174
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,479
really teeny tiny canono well not that

175
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,879
the canabo are teeny tiny but they're in

176
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,360
teeny tiny amounts that would be really

177
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:43,679
hard to change your genetics of your

178
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,240
plants it would take a long time to

179
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,039
change your genetics of your plants to

180
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,759
kind of bump up some of those really

181
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:53,838
minor canabo so let's watch for those

182
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:56,600
coming in uh through the B synthetic um

183
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,920
Growers it's it's very industrial but I

184
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,399
think it will have a place but we can

185
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:04,799
also start looking for those and maybe

186
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:07,720
combine them with our plant cannaboids

187
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,958
right so that so all of a sudden the

188
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:15,639
possibilities of combination of products

189
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,639
out there just becomes infinite

190
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,439
right uh what else did I want to see

191
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,079
I've got my notes here just so I don't

192
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,720
forget um one of thing I want to go back

193
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:28,479
to phyto canabo so the cannaboids phyto

194
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,759
means just of a plant so our phyto

195
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,519
canabo we have never looked at our other

196
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,559
plant medicine to see if our plant

197
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,519
medicine contains

198
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,799
cannaboids we know about four or five of

199
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,519
them so easia a great uh immunity herb

200
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,679
does have canabo like activity uh

201
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,078
spilanthes which is great for mouth

202
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:53,078
Health um helis scarum liver wart and

203
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:54,559
there's a few more out there but

204
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:56,719
remember what I said a few minutes ago

205
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,799
about cannabis is kind of the Gateway

206
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,278
herb it's because all of a sudden it's

207
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,838
like hey if this plant this cannabis

208
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:07,679
plant has all of these cannabinoids what

209
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,720
about all of the other medicinal plants

210
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,199
that we've been using for centuries for

211
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,519
Millennia what how how do they actually

212
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,800
work do they work with this endoc canabo

213
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,679
system that we have in our body probably

214
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:21,240
but we've never looked for it before so

215
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,799
that's pretty exciting I think it's

216
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,799
going to spur on a lot of really good

217
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:33,039
research um okay chemical definition of

218
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:37,759
cannabis is it belongs to the turpenoid

219
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:40,120
family so all cannaboids are tpes but

220
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,919
not all Turpin are canabo okay so it's

221
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,639
just a the canabo are a subclass of the

222
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:47,360
turpenoid family um and so that's why

223
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:50,560
they're pretty close together how do we

224
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,320
tell if something's a turpine or canabo

225
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,759
still a little bit Up For Debate but it

226
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,760
seems to be how it interacts with our

227
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:59,439
endoc canabo system just how it

228
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,919
interacts with our body and things

229
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,320
change even in the five years that I've

230
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,639
been studying things have changed uh

231
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,680
caropine or caropine however you want to

232
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,278
say that there's still a debate is that

233
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,078
a turpine or is that a canabo because it

234
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:15,480
does kind of interact with the canab

235
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:19,439
with the endoc canabo system doesn't so

236
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,879
we may see kilene may get reclassified

237
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,279
as a cannaboid just like Pluto is it a

238
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:26,600
planet not a planet right we're all

239
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:27,720
we're just still trying to figure all

240
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,120
that stuff

241
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,160
out okay so

242
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,839
um if a cannaboid is a a part of the

243
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,000
tpine family uh that's kind of the

244
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:41,240
chemical makeup uh but what about what's

245
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
a u medicinal definition of a canabo

246
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,079
what makes a canono

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,078
medicinal um that means it right now it

248
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:53,719
interacts with the CB1 and CB2 receptors

249
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:55,359
and or CB2 receptors within the body so

250
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,000
it interacts with our endoc canabo

251
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,519
system so in early days we've only known

252
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,039
about the endoc canabo system in our

253
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,679
body since the '90s late ' 80s the '90s

254
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:08,599
not very long

255
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:11,199
um but we're learning that there's the

256
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,240
endoc canabo system isn't just this

257
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,959
individual system within the body that

258
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,320
has cannaboid receptor one and cannaboid

259
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,198
receptor 2 so uh aply names that these

260
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,879
canabo interact with all of the

261
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:26,319
different receptors within our body and

262
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:28,879
within our brain so there's so much we

263
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,000
need to learn and how we I guarantee

264
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,720
that the definition of the endoc canabo

265
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,799
system 10 years from now will be quite

266
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,720
different than what it is today because

267
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,639
we're just learning things so one thing

268
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,278
we got to do as cannabis people is we

269
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,560
have to be willing to to allow our minds

270
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,879
to be changed because the definitions

271
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,439
are going to change we're just like

272
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:54,399
think about um you know when they first

273
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,079
started realizing that the Earth didn't

274
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,440
rotate around the sun right those kinds

275
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:02,479
of things or that you know some the

276
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,000
early knowledge that we now know as fact

277
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,480
that's where we are right now so 100

278
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,919
years from now they're going to look

279
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,680
back on this time era and go like whoa

280
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,879
that's what they thought about cannabis

281
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,239
like oh they didn't know anything did

282
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:20,240
they right but we're here we're now and

283
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,240
we're laying the groundwork for future

284
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:26,198
Generations okay so when

285
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:27,439
endocannabinoids or when cannaboids of

286
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:29,399
any kind whether it's supplemental

287
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,320
cannaboids or ones that are body Mak

288
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,159
ourselves um interacts with the

289
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,079
different receptors we get a

290
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:40,399
physiological response in the body so

291
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:43,078
you can think of um you know sometimes

292
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,839
THC might make you really sleepy so it's

293
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:49,799
sedative and in some cases depending on

294
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,360
what Doctor you talk to and what

295
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:55,319
response you're looking for that

296
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,480
sedation could be a side effect or it

297
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,160
could be the desired effect that's why

298
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,680
you're taking it so gain if somebody

299
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:05,480
says you know this is a side effect of

300
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:07,838
using cannabis it says well sedation is

301
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,879
only a side effect if you don't want to

302
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,839
be asleep at that time but sedation is a

303
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,919
desired effect if that's why you're

304
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,120
using the Cannabis medically is to help

305
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:19,838
you sleep right so we always have to put

306
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,839
everything in

307
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:29,319
context okay where am I at for time

308
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,639
here uh let's start go back to

309
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,320
cannabigerolic acid or cannabigerol CBG

310
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,519
I said a few minutes ago that's the

311
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,240
first cannaboid very briefly in the

312
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,360
growing cannabis plant just as the

313
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,759
flowers are just starting to form so

314
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,959
long before they mature um you're going

315
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,079
to get cannabigerolic acid is going to

316
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:54,039
come in the M

317
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:56,239
canono uh c a n n a b i g e r o

318
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:59,679
l and then if you want to go with the

319
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,600
acid one it's uh put in uh I I see on

320
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:06,559
the end and then acid

321
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,120
yeah so we know that um in clinical

322
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,198
studies

323
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,519
CBG helps increase the

324
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:16,439
appetite which is great unless you're

325
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,879
sitting there eating a bag of Doritos

326
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,120
and you can't stop till you get to the

327
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:23,679
bottom but when we look at medically

328
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,519
there's a lot of health issues out there

329
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:29,479
where people are so nauseous or they're

330
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,399
so weak that they can't get nourishing

331
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,480
food into their body and so what these

332
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:41,440
Studies have shown in people with uh HIV

333
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:43,839
AIDS or um um cancer situations or other

334
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,440
issues where the body becomes really

335
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,600
depleted uh and it becomes this vicious

336
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,920
cycle because they don't have the

337
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,240
strength to eat but without eating they

338
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:56,719
can't gain strength and heal so if we

339
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,120
have some agents that can help people to

340
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,079
eat then they can help have at least a

341
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,679
chance of their body healing right so

342
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:08,120
cannabigerolic acid and canaberal so

343
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,638
both the activated and the raw form we

344
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,198
got to find a better word than activated

345
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,600
because they're both active in the body

346
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,599
but for now we'll use that um there's a

347
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,560
lot of clinical studies that show

348
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,720
cannabigerolic acid and canaberal CBG

349
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:23,278
help increase appetite now if you look

350
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,120
at studies down in the states where they

351
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,318
don't have socialized Health Care people

352
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,679
pay for being in the hospital those

353
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:34,000
studies actually show less Hospital

354
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,359
costs like that's an outcome of the

355
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,480
study we think of like who cares about

356
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,680
the hospital cost like we we help each

357
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,759
other here in Canada right with with our

358
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,159
taxes you know maybe I don't need to go

359
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,600
to the hospital but maybe somebody else

360
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:50,519
does and I'm happy that it's there for

361
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,959
them right so um down in the states

362
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,240
you'll see some of these some of these

363
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:57,799
clinical studies come in with like much

364
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,519
reduced Hospital costs which is really

365
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:02,679
great for them but also we can increase

366
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:07,318
food intake and therefore increase

367
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:10,480
weight um I have a um a just a little

368
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:13,798
case study of a client that I had a few

369
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:17,679
years ago a young fellow he was uh he

370
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:20,318
probably mid teens at the time and for a

371
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,240
whole school year he hadn't been eating

372
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:26,359
cuz he was so nauseous and a few years

373
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,279
earlier his older brother had had a lot

374
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:31,279
of health issues so this young fellow

375
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,839
didn't want to bother his parents with

376
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:38,000
his nausey and vomiting um and not and

377
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:40,119
not being able to eat so he uh he

378
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,319
basically was trying to ride it out for

379
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:44,079
himself for a whole school year he kept

380
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,240
losing weight and losing weight and

381
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,159
losing weight to the point where he had

382
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,839
to tell his parents so he went to his

383
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,240
parents of course first thing parents

384
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:56,319
did take him to emergency um and and get

385
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,960
them checked out um and then the second

386
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:02,960
thing that they did was call up me and

387
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,798
say he had found Street pot to help him

388
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,880
with his appetite and it was hit and

389
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,720
miss cuz you know when we used to buy it

390
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,200
in the parking lot at 7-Eleven you never

391
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,880
really knew what you were getting so

392
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,000
sometimes his little baggy worked

393
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,679
sometimes it didn't um to help him

394
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,119
stimulate his appetite so he um what I

395
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:23,640
did and this is this is you guys use

396
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,119
this if somebody says you know I have a

397
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,320
friend of a friend needs to stimulate

398
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:31,558
appetite take three or four uh flour uh

399
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:34,000
different flowers and bring it to the

400
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,359
person and let them smell it see which

401
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,279
one do you think is going to stimulate

402
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,000
your appetite I can tell you what

403
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,359
stimulates my appetite but what

404
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,359
stimulates your appetite might be

405
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:45,399
completely different so let them choose

406
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:50,879
so we did that we got them set up with a

407
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:54,280
dry her vaporizer and uh became part of

408
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,760
the the family dinner is that he would

409
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,200
sit down and use his dry hair vaporizer

410
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,720
have a few hits on that get his appe and

411
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,038
the family would have their meal

412
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,000
together as it turned out he had a tumor

413
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:09,839
on his adrenal on one of his adrenals

414
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,640
and um it was cancerous and it was it

415
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:15,158
was causing um you know whatever the it

416
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,559
was killing the appetite basically

417
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:20,640
causing nausea so he wasn't he wasn't uh

418
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:23,119
didn't get hungry at all but he had lost

419
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,919
so much weight he had left it too long

420
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:28,479
that the doctor said this is major

421
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:31,200
surgery you need to put on 40 lbs it was

422
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,759
a tall kid he was skinny you need to put

423
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,919
on 40 lbs before you can withstand the

424
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:40,879
surgery and so through the help of our

425
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,200
plant friend he was able to do that they

426
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,440
gave him three months you know three

427
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,558
months you need to put on 40 lbs can you

428
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,840
imagine trying to put on 40 lbs in three

429
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:54,279
months crazy right but he did it um

430
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:56,399
through the help of of cannabis uh and

431
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:59,319
just finding the the right strain for

432
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,840
himself so uh he had the surg

433
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:04,119
happy to say he's mid-20s at this point

434
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:07,399
out working having a great time loving

435
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:10,639
life so y cannabis saved another

436
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:15,360
one okay I got sidetracked uh back to

437
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:19,159
CBG um CBG also enhances the actions of

438
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:22,279
the other cannaboids so if we're taking

439
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:24,679
it with um you know THC or CBD some of

440
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:27,558
the major canabo or two major canabo if

441
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:30,400
you will if we add a little CBG in there

442
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:32,678
you may get a better effect uh from your

443
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,960
THC and CBD so that's another reason to

444
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:40,280
kind of experiment with adding your uh

445
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:43,079
kolic acid or keral in there um here's a

446
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,558
super interesting one um they've done

447
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:47,599
some experiment with uh children with

448
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:49,720
autistic Spectrum especially

449
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,000
non-verbal and I've got some I am going

450
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:57,079
to give you a few stats here they used a

451
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,200
one: one so half cbga acidic form half

452
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:02,119
CBG uh activate

453
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,038
form the range is pretty pretty big

454
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:06,879
range so from 2 to 20 Mig a day which in

455
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,079
the grand scheme of things isn't that

456
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:13,600
much I'm not sure what form it was I

457
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:15,079
think probably a liquid form um and some

458
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,599
of the

459
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:21,038
nonverbal actually were able to start to

460
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,558
make some noise and maybe not fully

461
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:27,119
speak but we're able to you know there

462
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:30,000
was some hope there with that CBG right

463
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,599
and on a one to one so half AIC half the

464
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,679
activated or heated

465
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:40,319
form um when we add CBG to CBD so CBD of

466
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,278
course is great for seizure disorders

467
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,480
and it's becoming very well accepted

468
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:46,599
especially for children and Pediatrics

469
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,038
with seizure disorders we need high

470
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:50,719
amounts of that CBD though um so for

471
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,839
seizure disorders we're looking at

472
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,278
somewhere between 3 to 600 milligrams

473
00:21:53,839 --> 00:22:00,000
per dose to help manage seizures doesn't

474
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:01,319
always work but you could pulse it with

475
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
the seizure medication the

476
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,759
pharmaceutical seizure medication so we

477
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,880
can pulse it so when the pharmaceutical

478
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:09,798
stops working we can do the

479
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,200
CBD high high doses though when the CBD

480
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:12,960
stops working we go back to the

481
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,000
pharmaceutical right so we can pulse

482
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,000
them like that um but add some CBG in

483
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,480
some early studies are showing that hey

484
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,359
this actually makes CBD a little more

485
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,240
effective um and we may find that even

486
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:29,319
adding CBG in with your pharmaceutical

487
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,319
anti-seizure meds maybe that's more

488
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:33,399
effective we don't know yet we haven't

489
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:35,399
it's not that it it doesn't it's just

490
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,120
that we haven't figured it out yet we

491
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:42,278
haven't looked so many things we haven't

492
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:46,639
looked at um anxiety ADHD

493
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:48,880
OCD um 40 milligrams this was one study

494
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,320
they use 40 milligrams in so 40

495
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,880
milligrams a day so in two doses so 20

496
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:56,000
in the morning 20 in the afternoon uh

497
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,720
and this is just CBG not

498
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,759
cbga helped for people with anx I or add

499
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:06,759
or OCD which I I can I know add um it

500
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,960
can ruin your day right you you this is

501
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:10,158
what I'm going to get done today and

502
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,200
then add kicks in and squirrel squirrel

503
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:17,159
squirrel the end of the day it's like ah

504
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:20,319
I only got one thing done um so seem to

505
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:22,080
help that 40 milligrams a day but it do

506
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,200
did in the participants in that study

507
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,879
did have sleep disturbances they didn't

508
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,840
have a great sleep so again you know we

509
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,799
have to choose our battles here

510
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:35,678
um it could be similar for brain

511
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,558
inflammation which we know this horrible

512
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,320
Co that we've just come through three

513
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,240
years with it causes a lot of brain

514
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:43,960
inflammation so does a lot of other

515
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,880
parasitic activity other viral activity

516
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,840
people who have um Lyme disease uh the

517
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,080
co-infections from that cause a lot of

518
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:56,038
brain fog and stuff so this uh CBG could

519
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:58,480
help with that um and here's a really

520
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:01,759
interesting one if uh they've done a

521
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,798
clinical study with CBG with linol the A

522
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:06,839
tpine lolu and

523
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:10,400
lemine and they're finding that it may

524
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:12,759
help with staff infection so some of

525
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,320
those uh we're starting to get to what

526
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:18,319
they're calling post antibiotic age

527
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:20,200
where they think that possibly our

528
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,200
antibiotics well they are some of our

529
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,798
antibiotics already starting to become

530
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,798
less effective than they used to be um

531
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,960
but we could come to a place where our

532
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:32,240
antibiotics pharmaceutical anti bict are

533
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,399
working so there is a lot of really

534
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,519
active activity at looking at our plant

535
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:39,079
medicine to see what's going to replace

536
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:42,240
our antibiotics um you know if we get to

537
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:45,558
that place and CBG plus lenol plus

538
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:49,599
lemine may be pretty good go make a self

539
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:53,519
a first a self add in your CVG some of

540
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:55,480
your uh lemony uh some uh linol so so

541
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:59,720
some lavender and some Citrus and some

542
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:02,440
CBG High CBG plant could make a pretty

543
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,159
fantastic first aid uh first aid self

544
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,159
for ointment or

545
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,880
something okay better speed up a little

546
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:15,440
bit here um canab chroman or canab

547
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:18,520
chromic acid this is the second

548
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,320
cannaboid that forms in the the flower

549
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:22,720
before it reaches its whatever its

550
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:26,359
genetics are this is

551
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,038
even more brief less brief no more brief

552
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:31,879
happens for a smaller amount of time

553
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,440
than the CBG does so CBG forms first and

554
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,240
then enzymes kick in and it quickly

555
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,278
morphs into CBD canab chroman and then

556
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,839
sorry CBC canaby chromene and then

557
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:45,558
canaby chromin then morphs into whatever

558
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:47,959
the genetics of the plant are so there

559
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:49,519
are some people again some breeders

560
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,399
cultivators out there that are pushing

561
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,720
up the CBC so getting some usable

562
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:56,558
amounts from it so you don't have to

563
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,839
harvest your plants so early but again

564
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,000
figure out that timing

565
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:04,519
this is I have a uh somebody in the

566
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,159
Legacy Market who has a fantastic CBD

567
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:10,079
product out there both a a tincture and

568
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,480
a um a

569
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:16,398
cream I can't I've never seen anything

570
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,038
that does such a good job as the CBC

571
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:19,759
stuff like this is my favorite

572
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:21,359
cannabinoid at this point if if I can

573
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:25,240
have

574
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:30,879
favorites the skin healing properties of

575
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:34,480
this CBC is phenomenal so uh persistent

576
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,880
chronic um what they call refractive so

577
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,000
it means that it's resistant to any kind

578
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,120
of treatment uh eczema and

579
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,119
psoriasis takes care of

580
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:48,959
it um

581
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,359
diabetic uh like um diabetic uh sores

582
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,360
that you can get on the periphery

583
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:56,000
especially like on on feet and stuff

584
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:59,879
like that um he's had uh this friend of

585
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,960
mine uh is um has had people who have

586
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,919
been on antibiotics and and um you know

587
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:10,079
oral antibiotics topical antibiotics uh

588
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,320
all kinds of things nothing was touching

589
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:15,720
these diabetic

590
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:19,079
sores 3 weeks on this cream healed up

591
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,759
and so now this person uh this PA this

592
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:24,079
patient of his whenever they see

593
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,519
something o something's coming up just

594
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:29,519
takes care of it so it doesn't get out

595
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:32,278
of control right um this same stuff uh

596
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:36,319
somebody had a got a motorcycle burn on

597
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:37,919
their leg um and again same thing

598
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,359
doctors were flipping through all the

599
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,600
antibiotics all of the creams herbal

600
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:47,119
creams everything finally got to uh my

601
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:49,879
friend Bill and tried this CBC stuff

602
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:53,319
cleared up in less than a week less than

603
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:56,840
a week it cleared this stuff up so um

604
00:27:53,319 --> 00:28:00,119
CBC play around with CBC it's

605
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:00,119
fantastic um

606
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,798
uh also is not too bad for pain um I

607
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:10,558
also know someone who had some eye

608
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:12,558
surgery done and the the stuff that the

609
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,440
doctors had given them was it was okay

610
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:17,000
but they started using the CBC cream on

611
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,399
just on their eyes now it is a very

612
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,440
clean product it's got some olive oil

613
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:23,439
and some like extra virgin organic olive

614
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,840
oil and some a little bit of beeswax in

615
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,399
there and then the

616
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,199
CBC so it was very safe to put on on the

617
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,959
eye so they were putting on the eye at

618
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:38,159
night and um so the eye surgery was

619
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,200
healing up but their eyesight started to

620
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,159
improve like what the hell nobody can

621
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,120
prove did that do that or was that from

622
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:46,720
the eye surgery but it wasn't expected

623
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,518
from the eye surgery the eye surgery was

624
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,679
for something completely different so I

625
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:53,599
was like hm wait a minute so you know if

626
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,720
he got some of that cream and your eyes

627
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:58,639
are you know need a little bit of help

628
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,839
then give it a try put it on at night

629
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,559
it's a little goopy um but put it on at

630
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:08,119
night so we don't know

631
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:12,759
maybe um okay cbda so good old CBD

632
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:15,319
canabidol um and can cannabidiolic acid

633
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:17,158
uh if we use the raw stuff the the

634
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:21,480
unheated the acidic

635
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:25,278
form um we can get better management of

636
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,679
neuropathic pain than the heated form so

637
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:30,599
make your tinctures with the raw stuff

638
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,640
you don't have to decarb it um or maybe

639
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:36,599
you decarb half and you don't decarb the

640
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,559
other half um gout 200 milligrams which

641
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:41,639
is a fairly high dose twice daily for

642
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:44,158
four days eliminated gout in this one

643
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,200
fellow that's pretty cool because gouts

644
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,880
pretty painful and it reoccurs if you

645
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,519
know I had a client once um a little

646
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:57,278
aside and he would get go every couple

647
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,519
months it' be so painful and uh you know

648
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,759
one of my first questions questions is

649
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:02,839
well what's your diet like he ah pizza

650
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:05,319
and beer well how often do you have

651
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:07,000
pizza and beer maybe three or four times

652
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:09,359

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,599

659
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,879
money

660
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,398
maker um asthma CBD plus cbda so add

661
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:30,159
your activated form and your acidic form

662
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:34,439
you're going to get better asthmatic um

663
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:37,919
anti-inflammatory effects cbda is 5 to

664
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,880
seven times more available in the body

665
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,200
that means it gets into the bloodstream

666
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:46,480
five to seven times more effectively

667
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,840
than CBD does it's pretty good

668
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:53,278
um if we add

669
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:56,638
cbda with THC and

670
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:59,558
CBG we get much better anti-inflammatory

671
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:01,719
action in the gut right if we want to

672
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:03,398
improve our digestion and improve our

673
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:07,798
health we want to get the inflammation

674
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:10,000
out of our gut cbda THC is going to help

675
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,679
with the pain lower dose of THC and some

676
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,679
CBG in there might have some pretty good

677
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:18,798
you know clean up some gut

678
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,880
health uh seizure man management so we

679
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:23,638
were talking earlier about CBD is kind

680
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,360
of becoming a standard for uh seizure

681
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:27,199
especially pediatric seizure it's the

682
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:28,558
only cannaboid right now that is

683
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,558
accepted for for

684
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:35,798
Pediatrics uh for Pediatric use so um

685
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:39,599
they have found that one tenth of the

686
00:31:35,798 --> 00:31:42,480
dose of cbda is needed for the

687
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:45,158
equivalent anti-seizure activity of CBD

688
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,720
by itself holy crap that's pretty

689
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:53,720
amazing gets better pain management cbda

690
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:56,079
versus CBD you need one 100th of a dose

691
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,919
of cbda versus

692
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:02,480
CBD there's one that's even better

693
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,639
anti-emetic so that means uh stopping

694
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,919
vomiting

695
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:08,918
anti-emetic um

696
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:12,240
10,000th of a dose so meaning only you

697
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,799
only need minute doses just micro dosing

698
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,558
of

699
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:20,558
cbda versus how much you might need of

700
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:23,398
CBD now having said that we know that

701
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,879
THC is a much better antiemetic than CBD

702
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:27,038
is but there's a lot of people that

703
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,039
can't tolerate the psychoactivity or the

704
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:32,839
the impairment from THC than CBD so we

705
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:35,960
do need a lot more CBD for anti anti-

706
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:38,119
tic than um if anyone came to me and

707
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:41,000
said you know how do I stop vomiting i'

708
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:42,839
I'd go with CBD uh an inhaled CBD not

709
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,558
not eating it inhaled it's going to

710
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:48,720
quickly quelch that um but for someone

711
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:50,918
who can't tolerate THC uh cbda might

712
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,919
might

713
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,639
work yeah anytime I'm working with

714
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,200
anti-emetic or nausea I want to I want

715
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:00,079
to quick action so so I'm going to

716
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,919
inhale I'm going to suggest they inhale

717
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:06,638
it yeah appetite stimulate what's

718
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,200
up yeah yeah any kind of inhalation

719
00:33:06,638 --> 00:33:09,558
method is going to good and even you

720
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,360
know the vape pens we got some really

721
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:13,720
clean vape pen vape cartridges out on

722
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,759
the market now so yeah even that but my

723
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,440
my favorite is the dry her vaporizer

724
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:20,079
because it's the cleanest but it's kind

725
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,679
of a pain in the butt right it's not

726
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:25,839
quick a vape pen is super

727
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,278
quick okay moving on because I'm going

728
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:31,599
to run out of time here uh tetra Tetra

729
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:34,440
hydroc canabidol acid uh thca so that's

730
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:37,398
the unheated um and people like ah you

731
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,240
got a decarb you know for some things

732
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:41,558
you want to decar but maybe you don't

733
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,359
experiment get out there experiment try

734
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:45,638
it especially if you're a grower and you

735
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:48,359
have lots you have lots to play around

736
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:51,398
with try not decarbing and see what

737
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:55,519
happens um of course you can't smoke it

738
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:57,558
and not decarb right cuz smoking decarb

739
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,599
instantly right so um but that's when

740
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:03,558
you're making your tinctures and your um

741
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:05,079
um you're you know cooking it or putting

742
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:06,558
it into food that's not going to get

743
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:09,159
heated very

744
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:12,239
high um we get better nausey and

745
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:14,119
vomiting um the only problem with that

746
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,039
as we were just talking about is when

747
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:18,200
you're nauseous you don't want to eat

748
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:20,358
anything right so it gets a little hard

749
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:22,158
taking an oral product to quelch nausey

750
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,918
and vomiting unless it's something

751
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,039
chronic that you have throughout the day

752
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:30,358
right um effective at red producing

753
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:33,039
symptoms of irritable bowel and other

754
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:35,559
gastrointestinal issues and there is

755
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:40,838
some early clinical studies that show

756
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:44,239
that if we add uh a thca with a THC so

757
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:46,559
an acidic with a decarb form a heated

758
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,319
form together in a onetoone formula

759
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:51,398
we're going to get way better pain

760
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,399
management than just THC by itself and

761
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:55,878
also if for those people as I was

762
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:58,598
talking about earlier who either can't

763
00:34:55,878 --> 00:35:01,358
tolerate THC the impairment from THC or

764
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:03,519
they don't like it um and I've had a lot

765
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,400
of patients that uh until I've figured

766
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,838
some of this stuff out that say like

767
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,440
well your medicine really worked your

768
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,400
cannabis medicine really worked but I

769
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,838
don't like being stoned it just it's too

770
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,639
disorienting for me so um so then they

771
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:18,838
push it away they don't want to try it

772
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,358
right and then that's really sad to me

773
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:22,320
because then they try and go to

774
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:23,759
Pharmaceuticals and might not be as

775
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,000
effective and you get other side effects

776
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,560
and stuff like that so if we have equal

777
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,679
amounts of thca and THC maybe we can

778
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,480
reduce the likelihood of impairment and

779
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:34,519
help people be people be more

780
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,199
comfortable and still have their

781
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:37,199
effective pain

782
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:46,598
medication okay then I'm going to talk

783
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:49,279
about the Varin canabo so uh um cannabic

784
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:52,400
acid Tetra

785
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:57,359
Hydro Tetra Hydro

786
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:59,880
Canin in Tetra hydropenic acid um that's

787
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:05,358
my tongue twister for the day so we've

788
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:07,880
seen the thcv thcv cbdv cbdv so of

789
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:10,318
course the acidic is the raw one that's

790
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,160
what we find in the plant itself they're

791
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:15,119
just a slightly different form they have

792
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:17,559
a different chemically a different tail

793
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,960
on the end of them the varen ones versus

794
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:23,880
the nonv ones if you will and so that

795
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,280
will have a slightly different reaction

796
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,119
within the body so this is where we can

797
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,920
start to really fine-tune like even a

798
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,599
year ago or two years ago when I would

799
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,119
give this lecture it's like okay tpin

800
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,599
are how we fine tune our cannabis plant

801
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,640
sure they work great but let's start

802
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:43,119
fine-tuning with our canabo and we can

803
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,480
really get down to some nitty-gritty so

804
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,559
I was just having a conversation this

805
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,760
morning about um you know people always

806
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,440
ask well what's the best strain for this

807
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,240
and what's the best cultivar for that

808
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,760
like I don't know what's the best diet

809
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:56,598
right because I'm a nutritionist as well

810
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,800
so people ask me what's the best diet

811
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,760
well there's 800 or sorry there's 8

812
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,839
billion people on this planet I think

813
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,240
there's 8 billion perfect

814
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:07,599
diets there's 8 billion people on this

815
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:09,799
planet there's 8 billion perfect pay

816
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,079
medications and we now have the ability

817
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,280
to fine-tune it so if something doesn't

818
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,160
work let's tweak it a little bit and we

819
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,920
can tweak dosage we can tweak uh ratios

820
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,838
we can tweak cannabinoids um we can add

821
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,800
and then we have all the Tarpin so can

822
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,559
you see the it's an infinite possibility

823
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,560
right there's an infinite number of

824
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,239
remedies that we can get from this plant

825
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,519
and then we start adding in all of our

826
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,239
forest friends all of our other plants

827
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:37,759
in there it's like we we we have

828
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:40,000
lifetimes of research that we can do on

829
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,000
this

830
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,318
stuff um

831
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:51,599
okay so we don't have a lot of research

832
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:54,800
on the varen yet um but there is I work

833
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,519
with a canabo researcher out of the UK

834
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,680
you can look up her um her Google

835
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:04,280
scholar page she has tons of papers and

836
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:07,919
studies that she's uh contributed to and

837
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:13,319
uh her her name is um sersa O Sullivan

838
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:16,119
Sira s a i o r s e I believe and O

839
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:19,639
solivan oast and then Sullivan uh she's

840
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:22,400
out of the UK and if you look up her her

841
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:24,519
Google Scholar or her LinkedIn uh you'll

842
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,280
have access she's really generous with

843
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:27,960
uh some of the stuff that she's put out

844
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,720
there um

845
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,000
um so Varin like some of these other

846
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:36,118
minor cannaboids are found in very

847
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,079
minute amounts but again if you're culer

848
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,119
and you know how to work with genetics

849
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,760
it's all that part's all magic to me but

850
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:43,358
you know see if you can bump some of

851
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,560
that stuff up the

852
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:48,519
VIN uh not a lot of research yet but any

853
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,759
research that has been done in the Varn

854
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:52,318
has just been done in the last 10 years

855
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,160
so when you think of the grand scheme of

856
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:57,800
things that's like a day we've had a day

857
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:59,719
worth of research if that maybe an hours

858
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,318
worth of research in the Vance there's

859
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:03,239
so much we don't know we don't know what

860
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:05,519
we don't know uh and there's so much to

861
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:10,598
learn about

862
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:14,440
that and then we have CBN so CBN is um

863
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:17,200
canaby it doesn't you get a small amount

864
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:20,079
of it in the growing plant um but

865
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:23,118
basically it's the degradation of THC

866
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,039
and we know that CBN is uh probably the

867
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,318
most sedative of all the canono it's

868
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,920
wonderful for sleep helps you fall

869
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:33,279
asleep helps you stay asleep um so I

870
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,519
threw that one in there uh I know people

871
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,359
who don't like being stoned but they

872
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,318
love getting a good night's sleep so

873
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:43,519
they purposely take their cannabis their

874
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:46,199
flower grind it up and put it in the sun

875
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:50,559
which you go ah it's like no I want the

876
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:53,919
CBN they want to change it into CBN um

877
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:56,599
so it's famous for Sedation but there's

878
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,599
some people that find it works really

879
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:03,200
well with uh for pain meds and so can we

880
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,440
take a little add a little bit of CBN

881
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,318
maybe for your pain medication at the

882
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,760
end of the day where you want to get a

883
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:12,119
little bit sleepy so maybe you have pain

884
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,160
meds first thing in the morning you have

885
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,559
a certain blend for first thing in the

886
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:17,159
morning you have a certain blend for

887
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:19,400
middle of the afternoon and you have a

888
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:23,239
certain blend for the nighttime right so

889
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:27,480
we can start to play with some of these

890
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:29,479
combinations CBN also uh is it it can be

891
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,719
an appetite stimulant so increase food

892
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,639
intake as well and so that's why I have

893
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:37,318
lots of people that say I smoke my big

894
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:39,519
fat doie eat my bag of Doritos and then

895
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:41,358
I'm ready for bed well that's the CBN

896
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,159
kicking in making you hungry and then

897
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:44,920
making you go to sleep which isn't a bad

898
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:48,358
thing I would just replace the Doritos

899
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,358
for something a little bit better

900
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:57,920
but okay there is also a whole study of

901
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:01,159
canabo in combination

902
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,920
with Pharmaceuticals out there so let's

903
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:05,118
not throw away our

904
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,960
Pharmaceuticals because we don't want to

905
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,318
go back to only living till we're 40

906
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,079
years old let's also not rely completely

907
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:14,318
on our F Pharmaceuticals because they

908
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,240
have a lot of uh collateral damage in

909
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,599
the body usually it's the liver that

910
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:21,078
takes the the biggest hit from

911
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,680
Pharmaceuticals but how can we pair

912
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:24,039
these up and so there's a lot of

913
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,318
research out there that is showing

914
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:29,920
especially in cancer treatment that if

915
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:32,480
we add cannab in to certain types of

916
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,079
chemotherapy that we can actually lower

917
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,440
the amount of chemotherapy that's

918
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,920
required to be effective how great is

919
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:42,838
that because chemotherapy has some major

920
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,838
major side effects right uh it mostly

921
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:46,119
Works kills cancer yeah but it also

922
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:48,400
kills a whole lot of other things in the

923
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:52,440
body so we have to kind of maybe we can

924
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,200
find a balance there um so some of the

925
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,280
studies are showing when we combine

926
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:01,318
Pharmaceuticals with cannabis we we get

927
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,480
uh fewer side effects we get less

928
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:05,358
frequent flare ups for people who have

929
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,599
chronic disease where they can you know

930
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:10,239
get a flare up of that chronic disease

931
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,559
we can uh increase quality of life so

932
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:16,279
fewer side effects that cause you know

933
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:19,199
difficult issues um and then reduced

934
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,200
healthare costs

935
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:28,680
right okay I'm going to I always this

936
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:32,040
idea about oncology in cannabis how many

937
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:34,279
have heard that cannabis cures all

938
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:36,239
cancer we've all heard that right we've

939
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,920
all heard it the memes are going around

940
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:41,679
Facebook all the time sure it's true do

941
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,720
you know where that came from a

942
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:48,199
laboratory what's that in vitro inv

943
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:52,279
vitro inv vitro means in glass in a

944
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:56,000
laboratory so yes cannabis has cured all

945
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:59,440
cancer lines in a Petri dish with large

946
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,358
amounts of avonoids directly touching

947
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,639
the cancer cells over long periods of

948
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:07,039
time that's where that Facebook mean

949
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:10,199
came from so yeah it's technically true

950
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:13,639
does that translate into the human body

951
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:18,159
not at all not at all maybe not even a

952
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:20,199
rat body right but it does give us hope

953
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:23,318
that maybe at some point we can figure

954
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:25,159
these things out and so there are some

955
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:28,239
uh you know some clinical research going

956
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:32,279
on where they're they're they're

957
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:34,679
injecting canabo directly into a tur

958
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,760
tumor when they can get to it I mean you

959
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:38,919
know if it's in the middle of the brain

960
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:44,160
that's a little hard to get to right um

961
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:48,119
but but they're working on it right so

962
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:51,199
um where can cannabis can help in

963
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:54,559
oncology is it can help less inside

964
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:56,480
effects it can make the traditional

965
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,200
traditional the the current cancer

966
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,440
treatment more

967
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:05,078
tolerable um it can uh help with pain

968
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,559
maybe better than the opiates um or

969
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:07,920
maybe in combination here there's

970
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:12,119
another thing I didn't even include in

971
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:16,358
here when you take THC with opiods like

972
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:20,240
with um you can with Codine or with

973
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:23,000
um morphine you can actually reduce the

974
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:25,598
amount of opius that you use by up to

975
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,559
10% which is hugee because opiates are

976
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,760
so addictive but they're very effective

977
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,280
at pain meds but if we can reduce the

978
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,359
amount of opiods that we use so we use

979
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,800
opiods and THC in conjunction with each

980
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:38,440
other at the same time we can actually

981
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,880
take fewer

982
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,318
opiates um okay so back to using

983
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:47,400
cannabis with uh our current day

984
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:50,000
oncology treatment um irritable bowel

985
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,680
symptoms we can help people sleep better

986
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,838
they can have a better appetite so that

987
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:56,279
they have the strength to fight to to

988
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,679
heal and fight that off um but then

989
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,400
things like anxiet

990
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:03,078
we can help them with anxiety thank God

991
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,960
I've never had a cancer diagnosis I can

992
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:08,359
only imagine how anxiety inducing that

993
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,720
is right it's not only stressful for the

994
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:11,799
patient but it's stressful for the

995
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,679
people around them so we can use

996
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:18,079
cannabis CBD is my favorite for anti-

997
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:19,719
anxiety can help bring down anxiety um

998
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,640
can also help with

999
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:24,679
acceptance this is where I am in life

1000
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:27,558
you know you you can try and run but

1001
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:29,480
your Shadows coming with you so can help

1002
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,960
with acceptance and so that you can move

1003
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,440
forward you can't usually move forward

1004
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,280
with your life until you accept where

1005
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,318
you are and and it can help with courage

1006
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,319
as well can give us some

1007
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:46,318
courage so here's here's my challenge to

1008
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,480
you guys go out and

1009
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:50,719
experiment when you're experimenting

1010
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,199
keep good notes because you think you're

1011
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,118
going to remember but you don't remember

1012
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:55,879
that's my biggest problem I say oh I'll

1013
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,559
always remember this and then you get on

1014
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,400
to the two or three things L is like

1015
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,760
what was that what combination what was

1016
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:05,240
that ratio how much did I take um so

1017
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:08,240
keep good notes

1018
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:11,358
share experiment try different

1019
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:13,439
combinations there's no rules anymore

1020
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:15,759
cannabis does not have to be decarbed

1021
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,280
high THC for it to be medicinally

1022
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,640
effective maybe that's super fun and

1023
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,319
there's a time and a place for that

1024
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:24,159
absolutely but if we're trying to treat

1025
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:26,400
disease with cannabis there's no rules

1026
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,920
we can use the acidic form we can use

1027
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,280
the the the decar form the heated form

1028
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:34,000
we can combine we can add other plant

1029
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,000
medicine we can add Tarpin we can do

1030
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,358
combinations of all these things

1031
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,119
um just mix it up yeah experiment keep

1032
00:46:40,358 --> 00:46:45,358
notes send me send me your results good

1033
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:50,039
or bad right share them with your

1034
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:51,838
friends um uh grow grow like every

1035
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:53,440
season grow an extra plant and harvest

1036
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,400
it early see if you can catch some of

1037
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,720
that CBG or that CB CBC out of it and

1038
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,318
then combine that with your fully mature

1039
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:02,000
you know harvested at just the right

1040
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,558
time uh

1041
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,639
plant

1042
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:10,000
also you know just because I'm a I'm a

1043
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:14,679
mom and a grandma start lowo slow you

1044
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,440
know thcv is more impairing than THV but

1045
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:17,960
it doesn't last as long so just keep

1046
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,480
that in mind but all the other minor

1047
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,599
cannaboids you're not going to get that

1048
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,880
psychoactivity from them so we can be

1049
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,119
fairly careful but High

1050
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:29,280
CBD as you know we think it's pretty

1051
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:31,280
Innocent but it will kill your appetite

1052
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,680
and if you're taking high amounts of CBD

1053
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,599
which for some people say oh good I'm

1054
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:35,879
going to lose weight yeah but if that

1055
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:37,119
goes on for too long you're going to

1056
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,200
lose too much weight and then you're

1057
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,838
going to be malnourished right so uh CBD

1058
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:45,279
can also bring your blood pressure down

1059
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:47,199
too low um it can interfere with sleep

1060
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,920
for some people for some people can make

1061
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:51,078
them sleep all the time right so we

1062
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,039
always have to treat the plant with

1063
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:56,160
respect the same way that we treat our

1064
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:57,920
bodies with respect right so go out

1065
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,239
there experiment ment let me know how

1066
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,358
you're doing uh get some little at home

1067
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,439
test kits so for your your home grows

1068
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:06,119
you don't have to go spend $1,000 to

1069
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,480
find out what cannaboids are in there

1070
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:08,880
there's some really great test kits out

1071
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,240
there now so you know what you're

1072
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:15,039
working with

1073
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:19,199
um and I think that's oh

1074
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:19,199
yeah I got a few minutes for

1075
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:25,919
questions yeah any

1076
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,920
questions yeah

1077
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,280
endoc

1078
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:37,319
canabo we produce them throughout our

1079
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,318
nervous system

1080
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:45,920
yeah Absolut well I don't know about

1081
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,800
relaxed at all times because then you

1082
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,358
might check out and not be

1083
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,839
very productive with your life not that

1084
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:53,078
we all have to be super productive but

1085
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:54,838
you want to be able to get on with your

1086
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:56,960
life but you know how there is some

1087
00:48:54,838 --> 00:49:01,599
experiments on how we can take care of

1088
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:04,838
our endoc canabo system um this is one

1089
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:07,880
way um being in community sharing with

1090
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:10,119
other people um playing together is

1091
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,358
actually what the clinical study was

1092
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:17,079
when people play together whether that's

1093
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:20,119
sports or dancing or um chatting and

1094
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:23,599
sharing common goals your endoc canabo

1095
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:26,760
system gets bumped up

1096
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:29,039
singing singing increases your endoc

1097
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:32,240
avonoid production so that you can

1098
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:37,318
measure it in your blood amazing right

1099
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:40,479
Body Work massage um acupuncture um ACU

1100
00:49:37,318 --> 00:49:42,519
like osteopathic sex right that all

1101
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,440
bumps up your endoc canabo system if

1102
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:47,000
it's good right it's got to be

1103
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,000
caring

1104
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,400
um uh running running will bump up your

1105
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,639
endoc canabo

1106
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:57,400
system um eating well alcohol kills your

1107
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:59,358
endoc canabo system

1108
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,160
and it kills your immune well how it

1109
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:04,199
kills your immune system if you've ever

1110
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:05,920
been on a a weekend Bender with alcohol

1111
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:08,039
and then on Monday morning maybe it's

1112
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,240
Tuesday you start to get sick it's

1113
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:12,480
because the alcohol killed your immune

1114
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:15,000
system and so now it's going to take a

1115
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,199
few weeks to build that back up so

1116
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,519
minimize the

1117
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:22,039
alcohol um that will keep your endoc

1118
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:26,440
canabo system in better

1119
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:29,119
shape um there's one other one uh there

1120
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,318
have there have been some clinical

1121
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,400
studies on people who had difficult

1122
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:36,119
childhoods uh whether that was through

1123
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,079
abuse or neglect those kinds of things

1124
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:41,039
uh they do find that the endoc canabo

1125
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:44,200
system isn't as strong as someone who

1126
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:48,039
had a very nurturing childhood so that's

1127
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:49,960
for those people we need to really take

1128
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:52,960
care of our endocannabinoid system

1129
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:55,000
because it's already at at a you know

1130
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,960
maybe not working as it's already has

1131
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,480
some a bit of damage now that doesn't

1132
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,358
mean that that can't damage can't be

1133
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,358
repaired because we've seen people who

1134
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:05,639
have had very difficult childhoods

1135
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:08,558
become really you know very productive

1136
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:10,000
and happy adults so um but just keep

1137
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:14,119
that in mind might just be a little bit

1138
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,119
more work um

1139
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:28,000
yeah yeah you can you can get a THC

1140
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,760
hangover for sure that can it it's just

1141
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,280
it's lingering in the body it's it's

1142
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,280
your liver is still trying to clear it

1143
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,280
out that's why you kind of get that

1144
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:44,039
haziness it's all about fun have some

1145
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:48,160
fun sleep

1146
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:51,719
in dance sing go

1147
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:54,519
swimming play with your buddies yeah

1148
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:58,318
it's yeah we're doing research here yeah

1149
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:58,318
that's right any other questions

1150
00:51:58,798 --> 00:52:02,119
all right I have oh

1151
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,280
yeah yeah so some of that stuff we got

1152
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,960
to go look for it because there's

1153
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,280
there's a lot happening out there right

1154
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,240
now that's taking up all the chatter

1155
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,798
right um

1156
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:31,439
so the question was uh where's the

1157
00:52:29,798 --> 00:52:34,519
research we haven't now that it's legal

1158
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,159
where's the research it can take from

1159
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:39,639
concept of you know we should research

1160
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:43,960
this to it making to to your doctor's

1161
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:46,440
office 20 years so we're just getting

1162
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:48,240
ramped up when you do clinical research

1163
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,159
there's What's called the what's what's

1164
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:53,318
the primary endpoint which means what is

1165
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:55,440
the purpose of doing the research what

1166
00:52:53,318 --> 00:52:58,759
are we trying to prove here and that

1167
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,358
statement has to be exactly what you're

1168
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:04,480
trying to prove and so Professor ulvan

1169
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:06,798
who I mentioned earlier she she says

1170
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,760
that sometimes it can take two years for

1171
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:11,798
them to decide on what is our primary

1172
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:14,520
Endo how are we wording this because if

1173
00:53:11,798 --> 00:53:18,239
you don't word word the primary endpoint

1174
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:21,079
properly for uh for your clinical study

1175
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:24,318
and you don't hit that endpoint that

1176
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:26,200
means the clinical study has failed even

1177
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:29,239
though you might have learned a whole

1178
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:32,199
bunch stuff right so the research is out

1179
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:34,519
there go look up Professor ulvan there's

1180
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:37,118
there's um can't think of the name of it

1181
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:39,759
right now but there's a whole worldwide

1182
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:42,760
endocannabinoid research Association out

1183
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,920
there there's a lot of work going on out

1184
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,359
there we just don't hear about it so you

1185
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:50,079
got to go look for it um an interesting

1186
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:52,759
one down in Brazil uh in 20 late

1187
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:55,720
2020 um if you guys remember what

1188
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:59,400
happened in 2020 2020 was our first year

1189
00:53:55,719 --> 00:54:01,959
of covid and Brazil did not do a great

1190
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,039
job of Public Health measures so they

1191
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,039
were they were one of the countries that

1192
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:09,759
had the most people dying in it they

1193
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:13,199
were one of the top 10 um somebody in a

1194
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:15,480
teaching Hospital down in um in Brazil I

1195
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:18,159
can't remember what city it was in

1196
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:20,559
decided we should this is a great time

1197
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:24,719
to do some clinical studies and they

1198
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:26,960
took Frontline healthcare workers and uh

1199
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:28,480
they had some of them just you know

1200
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,440
because they were frantic our healthcare

1201
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,639
workers took the brunt of that in 2020

1202
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:35,559
it was brutal and uh so they had them

1203
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:37,078
you know they divided them out however

1204
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:39,960
many were in this clinical study they

1205
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:42,359
divided them out half of them just did

1206
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,920
their own thing and they were they got

1207
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:46,159
counseling when they needed counseling

1208
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:49,000
and and uh you know time off when they

1209
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:53,000
needed time off and then the other group

1210
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,920
um they gave CBD too and I can't quite

1211
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,719
remember the amounts of CBD I'm looking

1212
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,798
at one of my students over there if you

1213
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:01,759
remember um it doesn't matter but they

1214
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:04,039
gave them CBD on a daily basis and they

1215
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:07,240
wanted to see if that helped with the

1216
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:09,000
anxiety of being a Frontline worker in a

1217
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:10,798
hospital where they're used to have you

1218
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,159
know one person die a month and now

1219
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:17,838
they're having 15 people die a day on

1220
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:20,679
them and um and yeah their anxiety was

1221
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:22,400
way down like and so those little

1222
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:24,798
experiments unless you went looking for

1223
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,200
it you would never find it right uh

1224
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:29,480
because it doesn't make Frontline news

1225
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:32,519
um you know one little Hospital in one

1226
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:34,719
little city in one little country um

1227
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:37,358
during all of that other clutter that

1228
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:38,759
was going on out there so it's out there

1229
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:42,038
the studies are out there you just got

1230
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:44,240
to go looking for them and also studies

1231
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:46,640
researchers will only put money into

1232
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:48,838
something if there's anecdotal and case

1233
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:50,719
study evidence so that's why I say with

1234
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:53,078
you guys keep your notes because those

1235
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,798
are your case studies and we don't have

1236
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:57,240
to be medical professionals to have case

1237
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:59,759
studies we just have to have good notes

1238
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:01,118
and we can compile those notes and then

1239
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:05,200
other people can read them and if

1240
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:07,798
there's enough people saying hey I took

1241
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:09,919
CBG and CBC I'm just making this up I

1242
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:09,920
don't

1243
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,559
know when I last time you know when I

1244
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:17,039
felt like I got covid because I know I

1245
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:21,160
was exposed exposed and you know I

1246
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:22,880
didn't get very sick so hey you try this

1247
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:24,598
when you feel like you got exposed to

1248
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,760
covid and then you try it and you try it

1249
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:29,160
and you try it and then we'll compare

1250
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,039
notes and maybe only one out of 10 of us

1251
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:33,279
kind of got sick where the last time

1252
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:35,920
that happened nine out of 10 of us got

1253
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,559
really sick right so those that's once

1254
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,480
we get those kind of anecdotal things

1255
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:43,519
coming out then the researchers go hm

1256
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,039
maybe we should look into this a little

1257
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:47,559
bit more maybe we should add some money

1258
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:50,119
to this so there's no end of studies out

1259
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:52,920
there um and it is ramping up believe it

1260
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:55,200
or not that was that was a long answer

1261
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:58,000
um where are we at for time I'm over

1262
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:01,000
time so I will be I have a little booth

1263
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,400
over there and uh if anybody want has

1264
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,639
more questions come see me over there

1265
