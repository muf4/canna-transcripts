00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:13,348
[Music]

2
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:20,549
so about a year and a half ago and some

3
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,618
of my neighbors and friends who we all

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,710
live in a alternative back-to-the-land

5
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:28,018
community up in Mendocino County and we

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,219
were you know naturally just talking to

7
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,729
each other about the industry a lot of

8
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:34,738
people there grow and we're like how are

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,179
we gonna survive this tsunami that's

10
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,689
coming at us we don't even really know

11
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:42,539
what that means yet and you know what

12
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:47,519
what can we do to like make it through

13
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:49,890
and retain this like natural like pretty

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,289
sustainable chill lifestyle out in the

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,989
country how do we continue that and so

16
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,609
we decided to band together actually

17
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:59,849
combine forces with two other friends

18
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:02,609
when you're gonna interview Janet pretty

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,650
soon I think so she was one of those and

20
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,780
we started working together to form

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,150
Mendocino generations which was a farm

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,939
collective that we started about a year

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,939
and a half ago at this point and we

24
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,099
quickly grew from three farms to we have

25
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:18,959
43 farms right now and so I'm the

26
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,000
Operations Director of Mendocino

27
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,938
generations and we help farmers get

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,390
compliant we help them kind of navigate

29
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:30,539
this crazy maze of new regulation and

30
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,790
rules and you know local and state level

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,420
too and we help them with marketing

32
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,909
branding and so on so we felt like you

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,070
know a strength through unity was like

34
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,030
the only way we were you know going to

35
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,789
survive this

36
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,899
for the most part we all have one

37
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,000
unified goal and voice there is

38
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,280
definitely difference in opinions on how

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,840
things should go and need to go

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,968
especially because of people's personal

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,030
circumstances around their permitting

42
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:03,780
and so that has maybe caused some of the

43
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,670
biggest discrepancy and

44
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,780
opinions I think but for the most part

45
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,090
we're all really supportive of each

46
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,340
other and you know so-and-so over here

47
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,500
has a boundary issue we're gonna help

48
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,120
think of solutions or you know maybe

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,270
they just really want to farm and they

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,129
were not attached to that land they

51
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,709
could move and we could help them figure

52
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:25,169
that out there's a lot of different

53
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,420
benefits to collectively you know

54
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:28,919
working together and so I get to

55
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:30,568
handpick all the farmers that are in the

56
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,488
group which is a great benefit I like

57
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:34,229
interview them all I get to know them a

58
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:35,789
lot of people come to me word of mouth

59
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:37,829
or they know one of the other farmers in

60
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,479
the group and so they've heard about us

61
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,940
and they come to find us they seek us

62
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,849
out and so most people are pretty much

63
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:47,370
on the same level they're back to the

64
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:49,859
land sort of you know hippie folks and

65
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,080
Mendo and they fit really well together

66
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,670
they know each other they have good

67
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,890
rapport we go to each other's houses for

68
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:59,099
meetings and they've developed

69
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:02,429
friendships over time to that you know a

70
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,650
bond because of this group so some of

71
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,170
the biggest issues that my farmers face

72
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,709
I would say at this moment

73
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:12,828
besides the empty pit of money that just

74
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:20,250
kinda keeps coming down this black hole

75
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:23,040
is the building and planning regulations

76
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,860
I guess would be the biggest problem at

77
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,090
this moment and that's just because

78
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,470
different agencies within our local

79
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,150
government and the state government I

80
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:32,909
think they're putting down regulations

81
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,579
on growers cultivators you know

82
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:37,560
processing facilities distribution like

83
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,599
they don't really understand how we have

84
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,769
been doing business and how this is a

85
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:47,519
huge change for us this is like you know

86
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:49,469
takes a lot of sorry to be crass but

87
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,189
takes a lot of balls to do what we do

88
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:54,989
and stand up when it's kind of this gray

89
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:56,639
zone about are we doing it right are we

90
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,530
doing it legal and then what is legal

91
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,619
mean and people are you know taking a

92
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,719
huge leap towards compliance when really

93
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,629
the government and these regulatory

94
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,189
agencies in our local area don't even

95
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,719
know what it means to cultivate they

96
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:11,099
don't know what it's like they don't

97
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,530
know how much it cost they think we're

98
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,959
like moneybags

99
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,720
and they're trained to really capitalize

100
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,160
on that and you know until they really

101
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,889
understand that we're real people we

102
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,040
have real lives we have families you

103
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:27,350
know this is not a cash crop so much as

104
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,720
it used to be this is like just basic

105
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,460
survival and doing something that we

106
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,960
really have a lot of passion for and we

107
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:35,509
love so much and that's why we're doing

108
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,069
it now a couple of the biggest problems

109
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,589
right now with the building and planning

110
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:42,079
department in my County is that they

111
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:46,909
want us to have any building that has

112
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:48,800
cannabis in it to be commercial building

113
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:52,240
most of us out in the country where we

114
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,090
grow cannabis in my area is pretty rural

115
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,710
people did class K permits a long time

116
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:59,449
ago which means the county just kind of

117
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:01,489
like clean slated them moved him along

118
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:03,289
like here's your permit you're all good

119
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,810
to go but who would have ever saw this

120
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,780
coming so now how do you get your class

121
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:12,829
K garage or your shop or your dry shed

122
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:14,839
to commercial compliance it's a huge

123
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:18,019
endeavor and it's gonna cost a ton of

124
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,789
money and so now the county because of a

125
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:21,620
lot of us standing up for ourselves and

126
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,819
what we believe in and being the squeaky

127
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,009
wheel you know the squeaky wheel gets

128
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:27,168
the grease these days like if you go in

129
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:29,240
and say hey I'm a real person and I have

130
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:32,240
a real problem can you help me there

131
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:36,079
really I think open to that and learning

132
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,150
as they go to and so you know they're

133
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,120
changing things a little bit to help us

134
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:42,918
so now they've created this AG exempt

135
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,228
category where you can have a building

136
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:49,299
that only touches cannabis like it

137
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:49,300
doesn't really have multi purposes in it

138
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:57,770
they're helping us by you can apply for

139
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,680
an AG exempt permit for that building if

140
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:02,478
it's only a single use for cannabis so

141
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,069
drying shed for instance or a storage

142
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,560
shed

143
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:10,699
so that's one big change that's happened

144
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,740
and the next I would say it's positive

145
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:14,659
for some people but for other people who

146
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,220
naturally use a building for multiple

147
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,620
things like aren't gonna be able to have

148
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,760
a AG exemption permit for that building

149
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,139
and they're still gonna have to go down

150
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,899
the road of commercial compliance and

151
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:26,389
actually that's my case I have a

152
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:29,329
building that's like a guesthouse on the

153
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:31,399
top and a garage on the bottom and our

154
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,379
cure and dry and like storage rooms are

155
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,149
all connected in one building it's

156
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:39,560
easier for powers you know it's easier

157
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:42,259
for everything so that new regulation

158
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,250
change it's not gonna actually benefit

159
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:50,449
me but one of the other great benefits

160
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,670
is like working with well - working with

161
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:54,019
a group is I can send my farmers to go

162
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,699
to these like board of supervisor

163
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:57,349
meetings and say hey stand up for this

164
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,120
issue can you mention this write a

165
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,280
letter and we're all like collectively

166
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,870
helping each other stand up for each

167
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,969
other and that's been really empowering

168
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:08,689
and great I would say in Mendocino

169
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:11,690
County the local government is pretty

170
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:14,680
open to cannabis now they were quite

171
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:17,689
resistant in the beginning really not

172
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,400
caring I don't think that much and a lot

173
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:21,290
of them are actually coming out to farms

174
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:23,779
now and visiting these facilities and

175
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,189
meeting us one-on-one having personal

176
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:27,229
conversations who run into them at the

177
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:28,459
grocery store we you know reach out at

178
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,650
different events or we have mutual

179
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:32,060
friends and that's kind of the way we

180
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:34,310
were like building a rapport with them

181
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,930
like oh these are real people these are

182
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,449
good people these aren't just like you

183
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,009
know crazy dope growers like giant

184
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:43,789
trucks that have all this money like

185
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:45,920
they think that we all are so I think

186
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,410
that they're coming around but I think

187
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,480
there is still some resistance

188
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,820
especially in these new departments that

189
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,700
are having to get involved because the

190
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:57,800
state is going down the legal road right

191
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,139
so some of these people on building and

192
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,370
planning for instance or like anti but

193
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,889
because they never had a deal with us

194
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,180
before and so once they establish

195
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:07,159
friendship relationships or rapport with

196
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,199
people we come into the office every day

197
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,450
ask questions I'm like here representing

198
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,250
43 farms they're like oh you're a cool

199
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,199
person like you're great I'm gonna help

200
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,759
you now and so now they're starting to

201
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,740
kind of come around and and be more

202
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:23,089
friendly and it's like a regular like a

203
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:25,069
its normal with the state licensing I'm

204
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:29,599
not really sure what to say about that

205
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:32,750
yet I am nervous about it personally and

206
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,639
I would say our collective and our farm

207
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,979
group doesn't really fit into one of the

208
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,539
licensure categories and so I don't

209
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,310
really know where to go with that at

210
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:43,339
this moment personally my farm it's

211
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:45,049
pretty obvious but for the rest of it

212
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,450
I'm not quite sure yet how that looks

213
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:48,829
every day it's something new literally I

214
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,620
opened my email or I get a phone call

215
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,389
from somebody and they say have you

216
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,740
heard about this you know about this yet

217
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:58,639
or what are we going to do about this

218
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,049
and so every day it's just like I kind

219
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,580
of feel like one of those I'm like

220
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:03,139
training for the army you like run

221
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,730
through the tires and then you climb the

222
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:06,649
wall and you like launch over this thing

223
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,000
like every day it's something new and

224
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:10,909
you just have to like just roll with it

225
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,470
and you know you have to be flexible or

226
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:14,860
you're just not going to survive this

227
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,860
industry

228
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:29,819
