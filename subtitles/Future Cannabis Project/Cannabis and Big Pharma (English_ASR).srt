1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,830
and speaking about other you know

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:09,689
cannabis solutions is his Big Pharma and

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:12,379
dr. Ethan Russo is here to talk on the

4
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:14,939
three echelons of cannabis commerce

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,399
pharmaceutical development standardized

6
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:21,358
cannabis supplements and artisanal

7
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:24,149
production you know Ethan you talk about

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,250
a peaceful coexistence can you explain

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,768
that to us and what that would mean to

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,740
us as a collective first by way of

11
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:34,859
introduction yes I'm a neurologist but

12
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:37,969
I've been an organic farmer since 1974

13
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:40,920
when I was a grad student at UC Davis

14
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:44,429
additionally while I was in practice in

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,289
Montana I ran a thing called boffo the

16
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:50,119
Blackford organic fruit and flower

17
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,590
operation and sold the most expensive

18
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:56,780
organic vegetables you can imagine at

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:01,230
the farmers market and Missoula but

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:04,320
there are three echelons of activity in

21
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:06,478
terms of how cannabis is produced the

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,959
model that you probably will not be

23
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,719
emulating is the pharmaceutical model in

24
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:16,019
that I like to say that there four

25
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,868
pillars of true medicine and got a

26
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:22,438
graphic here I find now you've probably

27
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:26,340
all read the hundred page PDF that I

28
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:30,029
sent but anyway this is just a little

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,180
analog demonstration so the four pillars

30
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,368
of a true medicine are efficacy does it

31
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,750
work safety self-explanatory

32
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:42,390
standardization that might require a

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,799
little more explanation can you show

34
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:49,079
absolute chemical consistency over time

35
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,329
and this is a prerequisite of a

36
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,938
pharmaceutical and then the one that's

37
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:56,008
often ignored is the fourth one called

38
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:59,519
accessibility and that's a combination

39
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:02,218
is it available number one but number

40
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,250
two is it affordable because if it's not

41
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:07,199
if we're talking about biological

42
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,959
medicine the things they advertised on

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,430
TV and they hope you're not listening

44
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,990
when there are two paragraphs of

45
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,240
rapid-fire side-effects that they

46
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:21,120
scribe most of those medicines are in

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:23,620
the 50 to 60 K per year range and cost

48
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,560
now you're dealing in a much more

49
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:30,939
reasonable level so beyond the

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,159
pharmaceutical model which is generally

51
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:35,800
a 10 to 12 year proposition and

52
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:41,620
somewhere between 800 and one-point

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:46,380
million and 1.2 billion expenditure it

54
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:48,250
is the case that you can make a

55
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,680
botanical medicine that's a

56
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:54,759
pharmaceutical approvable by the FDA

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:58,770
this has been done with epi dialects 98%

58
00:02:54,759 --> 00:03:02,979
pure CBD I would have been a lot happier

59
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:05,800
if that had been an extract with full

60
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:08,939
flavor and capabilities in the medicine

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:13,480
but I don't work at that company anymore

62
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:15,729
but you're not likely going to be going

63
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,949
for that if anybody's interested in

64
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:21,369
genuine pharmaceutical production we can

65
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:27,339
talk more later the second echelon of

66
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:30,460
activity would be material that's still

67
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,219
pretty standardized but would say be

68
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,960
sold on the supplement market and so

69
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:38,139
this could be any number of products

70
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,260
that are derived from cannabis probably

71
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:44,619
not so much straight flower but any kind

72
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:48,310
of extraction and it could be a topical

73
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,110
it could be oral could be some of the

74
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,969
products that we've seen people bring

75
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:58,560
today but this isn't a growth area

76
00:03:53,969 --> 00:04:01,919
clearly a lot of you might know people

77
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,659
like horizon herbs and things like that

78
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,879
some of those people especially in

79
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:08,740
Southern Oregon had big enough

80
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,840
operations that they were able to put

81
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:14,080
out their own tinctures commercially and

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:18,899
this kind of thing this is again

83
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:23,040
requires a lot of bureaucratic rigmarole

84
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:27,310
to do properly but it's below the

85
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:31,410
pharmaceutical effort and finally is the

86
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:34,449
the artisanal for lack of a better term

87
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:37,360
now it's not the case that everyone has

88
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:40,300
an expert herbalist in their

89
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,300
neighborhood and can vouch for you know

90
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,220
this batch material is really strong so

91
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,939
you want to be very careful with it as

92
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:53,250
opposed to it's good for this condition

93
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:56,469
and not so much for that condition but

94
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:59,439
for you that have been doing this a long

95
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,630
time I'm sure you have good ideas about

96
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:06,668
what you have and what it's good for and

97
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:09,850
that hopefully can also succeed in the

98
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:12,370
current difficult market but you do have

99
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,560
to distinguish yourself in some way and

100
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,740
I'll be talking a lot more about how to

101
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,110
do that later particularly with regards

102
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:23,168
to different components of cannabis on

103
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,960
how what their therapeutic benefits are

104
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:28,500
and how they can be leveraged in a

105
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,500
patient population
