[Music]

2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,868
Tim Blake has several cannabis

3
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:26,849
businesses he's working on and he's

4
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:29,839
going to talk to us about manufacturing

5
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:34,409
today and then Amanda will talk about

6
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:36,780
flow Cana and distribution okay well

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,939
thank you and for the Emerald cup we

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,620
will have our license this year I feel

9
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,780
sorry for high times in some ways but

10
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,030
but as far as us we're working with the

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,950
state and we're working with Main Street

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,020
strategies and we're proactive and we're

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,550
way in front and they really love what

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,829
the cup has done and we will have a

15
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:55,189
license and be doing very well with the

16
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,359
cup this year so as far as manufacturing

17
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:59,369
you know you talked about the cup when

18
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,378
we first started it was flowers you know

19
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:04,048
later on we bunny did the concentrates

20
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:05,849
cold water and stuff and over the years

21
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,710
now you've seen that evolved to where

22
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:09,478
the flowers are really a small part of

23
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:11,548
the cup yeah like you know twenty other

24
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:12,929
contests going on and so what you're

25
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,130
looking at is the flowers becoming a

26
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,900
smaller smaller part of the whole

27
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:17,429
industry you know eventually it'll be

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,420
probably less than ten percent if you

29
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,770
look at people coming out with the

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,259
cartridges and now they're getting so

31
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,090
good all of a sudden you get the Terps

32
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:25,950
they burn right or vaporize right and

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,020
they work all the way down so people are

34
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,978
getting very accustomed to that and so

35
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:33,359
what you're seeing with manufacturing is

36
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:35,219
everything's going to be extracted you

37
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,629
know you talk about its oil fields now

38
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:38,429
it's not even flower fields anymore

39
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:40,259
they're called oil fields and that's a

40
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,460
new term that's coming out and so what

41
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,899
you've got is you get different forms of

42
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:44,669
extraction coming out you know back in

43
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,379
the day we're doing cold water

44
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,019
we were only solvent list we wouldn't do

45
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,149
anything at the cup with hydrocarbons or

46
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:54,328
because of the legal issues and people

47
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,070
blown themselves up and then using a you

48
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:57,839
know mystery gas in the cans

49
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:00,000
well that's changed now now you've got

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,409
systems that are like a million dollars

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,879
coming out that'll go to your field and

52
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,920
process like twenty five hundred pounds

53
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,509
in a day and just bring that out I mean

54
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,159
they're like million dollar hydrocarbon

55
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,389
machines and with the state going legal

56
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,250
with that you've got these different

57
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,348
forms of extraction coming out so you've

58
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,959
got the traditional

59
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:17,119
alcohol you've got co2 which people are

60
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,139
using a lot of and then you've got

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,150
hydrocarbon with XA in propane and

62
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,739
butane we have a new manufacturing plant

63
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,420
right outside of the Willis City Limits

64
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,188
and we're actually I was talking with

65
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:27,839
John McGowan the lead supervisor we're

66
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:30,388
going to apply for type seven and do

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,299
hydrocarbon I explained to John why it

68
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:34,109
first of all it's got the purge systems

69
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:36,989
get rid of it all you've got

70
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:38,280
pharmaceutical grade hydrocarbons and

71
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,840
then you've also got recirculating

72
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,609
systems where they're using almost none

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,709
of the material it's all being recycled

74
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:45,269
so we're gonna use all ways of

75
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,560
extraction to go into our products we're

76
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:46,980
still going to be based as much as we

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,590
can

78
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,658
solvent list but the industry is moving

79
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,370
very quickly in that direction and so

80
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:55,468
what what's happening with all these

81
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,489
manufacturing places let's look at the

82
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:58,620
whole world and we'll bring it back to

83
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,180
where we are really quickly in the world

84
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,009
you've got all these companies in the

85
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,840
countries going legal you've got Jamaica

86
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:05,848
you got Czechoslovakia again you got

87
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,680
Uruguay you know Colombia Colombia took

88
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:09,149
our flowers 40 years ago traditional

89
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,069
flowers they're gonna come after all of

90
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,199
our cannabis flowers right now you got

91
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:15,000
Jamaica you got other places what's the

92
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,889
big company the big boy in the box it's

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,930
Canada first g7 nation that's going to

94
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,849
distribute worldwide they've gone

95
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,340
recreational completely they're now in

96
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:25,048
talks to licence 150 products that can

97
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,938
go worldwide they just shipped Aurora

98
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:29,188
can imagine shipped to Italy they're

99
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:30,658
going to Germany you got the Israelis

100
00:03:29,188 --> 00:03:32,219
taking over the medicinal market and

101
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:33,478
they're going to ship all over the world

102
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:35,579
medicinally they've been out in front of

103
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,540
us about 20 years and so if we look at

104
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,250
it while we're sitting here trying to

105
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,739
fight our way out of a box in this

106
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,408
county in California the rest of the

107
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,150
world is so quickly moving beyond us

108
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:46,590
it's gonna it's going to take forever to

109
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,120
catch up now there's good parts of that

110
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,128
we'll get back to but for right now

111
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,810
we're looking at the manufacturing of

112
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,500
these products throughout the world and

113
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,479
that's what they're doing they're

114
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,239
manufacturing oils they're not really

115
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,709
setting flowers so what do we do in this

116
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,109
country we send all of our manufacturing

117
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,579
off sure we don't have any manufacture

118
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:04,829
anymore the great thing is is that

119
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,019
cannabis really along with SpaceX with

120
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:08,340
musk what he's doing and Tesla we're

121
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,680
gonna actually bring manufacturing back

122
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,269
to this country and cannabis is going to

123
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,099
be the biggest growth industry

124
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,959
manufacturing wise and distribution wise

125
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:18,658
of any product of anything in the world

126
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,069
over the next 30 years so we're gonna

127
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:22,288
really lead the way it it's all going to

128
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:24,110
be manufactured products but we have to

129
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:26,860
find out where we fit in that rule

130
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:31,098
and right now we're losing a giant share

131
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,870
to Canada really and the Israelis and

132
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:34,848
their we're going to take that so then

133
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,449
you fall back to what we're doing in the

134
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:37,158
States

135
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,110
okay well what's in the state happening

136
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:40,430
is we're filing for a manufacturing

137
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,110
permit and cultivation permit in

138
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,759
Pennsylvania you got to have two hundred

139
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,439
fifty thousand dollars to apply you got

140
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,759
a million dollars in the bank and you

141
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,530
got to know somebody we're actually

142
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,110
working with a attorney who's a former

143
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:52,369
DEA agent and it's interesting about my

144
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,840
position being where I come my whole

145
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,519
life I'm talking about the DEA agent he

146
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,810
and he was funny he wanted to know if if

147
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,579
we were going to be legal enough and

148
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,348
follow the guidelines and I had

149
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:02,418
explained to it what we've done with the

150
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:04,189
the sheriff surveys with Tom Allman up

151
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:05,810
at area 101 and all the activism and

152
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:07,639
stuff and that we we're no problem with

153
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,079
that so check this out and so we have an

154
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,699
attorney DEA agent helping us get a

155
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,408
manufacturing license in Pennsylvania

156
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,538
because you have to be in West Coast and

157
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:16,189
East Coast the rest of the states are

158
00:05:14,538 --> 00:05:17,750
gonna really chew this up very quickly

159
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:20,750
if we don't and I mean you look at

160
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,639
Washington Colorado all over the East

161
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,079
Coast and so we're not only losing our

162
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,728
black-market flowers we're gonna lose

163
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,528
our black market cotton well forget the

164
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:29,329
black market the other market cartridges

165
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:31,759
and the other forms of manufacturing if

166
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,740
we don't move very very quickly and so

167
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,590
we we really have an uphill battle in

168
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:40,310
many ways now you peel it back to the to

169
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:44,239
the local situation that we've got here

170
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,860
and you know it goes back to people are

171
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,569
saying I'm Floquet know we all want to

172
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,150
represent small farmers and I say that's

173
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:51,379
what the air moan cup is to but really

174
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,968
there should be a new phrase that comes

175
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:55,069
out we want to represent we want to rip

176
00:05:52,968 --> 00:05:56,899
well we are representing the best of

177
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:59,360
small farmers because at the end of the

178
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:01,250
day that's all you can represent when

179
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,419
Mikey can't even from cloak Anna and

180
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,009
wanted to represent all the small

181
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:06,228
farmers I said we already did that with

182
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:08,598
with Mendocino farmers collective and I

183
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:09,918
had a collective up at area 101 and what

184
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:11,870
happened was we took 50 people's

185
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,338
cannabis flowers and realized that only

186
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,050
five retainer that would actually sell

187
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:16,728
and we had to give it all back and then

188
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,259
we had to realize we had to cherry pick

189
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:19,579
just like the black market is because

190
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,560
you just can't take it and nowadays

191
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,329
everybody knows you try to sell be great

192
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,769
black market people don't even want be

193
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:26,418
great oh geez not even if they're seven

194
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:28,158
or eight 600 hours a pound they don't

195
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:29,990
even want it they just want the finest

196
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:30,968
it move my be great OG to a high grade

197
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,189
flour

198
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:34,988
with you know perps or something any day

199
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:36,039
so it's the same at manufacturing if

200
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:37,598
you're going to go to manufacturing

201
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:39,579
system you have to have incredible

202
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:41,110
medicines that come out of there and so

203
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:42,968
even if it's going into an edible even

204
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,369
if it's going into a tincture of SAP

205
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:47,860
it's still product in product out and

206
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:49,419
you know this isolate this hemp you know

207
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,408
materials that they're doing for CVD

208
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:52,329
it's all garbage and they're already

209
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:54,879
talking about all over the country so

210
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:57,249
you've got you look at Fred from CVD

211
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,709
Mendo or Russell back there from CVD

212
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:02,439
healing medicines they're all growing

213
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:05,439
biodynamic they're growing high-grade

214
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:07,629
organic organic flowers and and medicine

215
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,278
and so whether it's flow canna is

216
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:12,009
manufacturing you're gonna have flow

217
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:15,238
Khanna's can imagine fashioning in rugby

218
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:17,110
valley we're gonna have three or four in

219
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:18,728
Willets here you're gonna one of your

220
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,968
chi you know about ten manufacturing

221
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:23,348
plants in Mendocino County alone how

222
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:25,598
many of those will make money probably

223
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:27,338
only a couple there's over a hundred and

224
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,829
something permits for manufacturing

225
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:31,449
almost all are type seven right now and

226
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:33,069
so we're going to be competing against

227
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:35,259
major manufacturers throughout the state

228
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:37,149
but it still comes down to their product

229
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:38,769
so for you guys what matters I mean I

230
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:40,809
guess on the manufacturing side is we're

231
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:42,129
gonna do a product and you want a white

232
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:42,639
label with somebody like us with low

233
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,289
canna

234
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,179
you're gonna have to have the finest

235
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:47,649
product or you don't even have a chance

236
00:07:46,178 --> 00:07:49,628
I mean Amanda can tell you if you look

237
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:51,038
at the distribution companies I could go

238
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:53,050
into all that whole thing - you've got

239
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,538
River who's our distribution company

240
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,639
just merged with Canada royalty you've

241
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:58,748
got distribution merging left and right

242
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,179
and you're gonna do the same thing in

243
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:02,559
manufacturing and it's consolidate down

244
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:04,508
and the only people are going to really

245
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,129
be able to have a manufactured product

246
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:08,199
to go out are people that have something

247
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:09,939
phenomenal people that love doing social

248
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,169
media people that have deep pockets

249
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:12,669
people that are great marketing people

250
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:14,468
otherwise you're not going to

251
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:16,028
manufacture a product but if you make a

252
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:17,168
good product you could work with Floquet

253
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,579
know you could work with us you could

254
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:21,278
work with somebody else and do

255
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:22,869
co-branding you could do white label you

256
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:24,848
can end up selling the product to us and

257
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,349
we could do something together there's

258
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:28,118
ways to go about it but it's really

259
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:30,218
going to start with you know some type

260
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:32,860
of really fine product or you're gonna

261
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:35,198
drop down into being an oil producer for

262
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,308
you know concentrates and extracts now

263
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:37,658
they're you know what that's not a bad

264
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,828
living in there you started thinking

265
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:40,000
about it I mean I haven't done all the

266
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:41,859
numbers but we run them around and stuff

267
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,059
if you're really good you know get

268
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,409
depths and you bring it in 50

269
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,509
pounds a-year you look you're selling

270
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:47,799
for 300 bucks you know by time you pay

271
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,639
your taxes and everything else you got

272
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:51,099
all your workers in there

273
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,480
you can still make 75 to 125 grand a

274
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,649
year if you're good and you know what

275
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,850
you're only working six months of the

276
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,620
year people are coming to picking it up

277
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,879
you're not really trimming it caring at

278
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,649
dealing with all the issues and you get

279
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:01,539
the rest of the year off so you know

280
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:03,129
there is a world and life out there for

281
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:04,809
cultivators delivering just to

282
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:06,220
manufacturers because what you're going

283
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:07,899
to see is people going up these fields

284
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,610
with the their even got co2 machines

285
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:11,049
will go out there now too and going into

286
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,240
the fields and just basically harvesting

287
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:14,679
it right there and but you really need

288
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,149
to have the right strange to go with

289
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,189
that - I mean we go into a whole thing

290
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:19,539
about yeah when you're manufacturing

291
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,710
products you got to get quantity and you

292
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:22,179
got to get quality you got to get the

293
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:25,300
terpenes so you have to have the right

294
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:26,799
strains and nobody wants edgy you know

295
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:29,229
anymore you look at it they're looking

296
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:33,129
for turps and fine things so on a

297
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:35,769
manufacturing level this county is going

298
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:36,759
to do really good manufacturing there's

299
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:39,159
something else I want to say before I

300
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,289
lost my time we find the distributor's

301
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:44,019
that down in LA nobody cares about

302
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,730
general triangle or organic solvent list

303
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:47,199
they care about snap crackle and pop you

304
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,330
know who care about sauce and butane and

305
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,800
stuff and Shatter they were talking

306
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,240
about I think it's true we're gonna have

307
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,579
a better time with Emerald triangle

308
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,049
products and flowers once we get out of

309
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,280
this box and get out of this state and

310
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:58,929
get across the country and across the

311
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,449
world because they're the Emerald

312
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:03,459
triangle name has real value people will

313
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,410
want that so there's real hope for our

314
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,970
products and our flowers as we bust out

315
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:09,338
and we compete against the international

316
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,019
markets and it just comes down to not

317
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:12,610
only that flower being a degrade but

318
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,289
really having an incredible product that

319
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,460
goes with it so work with a great

320
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,959
manufacturer work with a great

321
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,430
distributor and you've got a chance and

322
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:30,580
make a great product and you'll be there

323
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:31,809
thank you very much I'm just gonna talk

324
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,810
a little bit about advocacy and

325
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:38,259
distribution as kind of a social justice

326
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:40,000
piece of the supply chain I did not mean

327
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:43,899
to say that they're mutually exclusive

328
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,179
so yes of course advocacy continues yes

329
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:48,159
and so I just wanted to talk a little

330
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:49,569
bit about how flokati evolved because a

331
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,458
lot of times when we look at what's

332
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,200
going on with agriculture and business

333
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:55,539
in general in the United States it's

334
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,550
very top-down right so it's the folk

335
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:59,198
have a lot of money making decisions

336
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:00,939
about how they can make more money by

337
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:02,409
infiltrating their power down to the

338
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,800
people who have very little control over

339
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:08,139
their situation how we grew up was

340
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:10,149
really kind of the opposite you know we

341
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:12,698
started as a delivery service in the Bay

342
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:14,740
Area and we were sourcing product from

343
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:16,838
farmers in the Emerald triangle our

344
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,909
founder Michael Steinmetz had come up

345
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:21,910
here and visited with farms and really

346
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:23,669
saw the magic you know having been here

347
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:26,740
from South America had a lot of

348
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:29,979
appreciation for small agriculture and

349
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,409
agricultural cooperatives and so the

350
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,940
idea was that we really what was

351
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:36,399
happening here was special and how do

352
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,079
you get that to the public and that's

353
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,610
really at the core of what a distributor

354
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,500
is supposed to do they're supposed to

355
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,720
find things that are special and figure

356
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,278
out how to get it to the public and I'll

357
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,899
talk a little bit more about what that

358
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,850
looks like in a scenario where you're

359
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:49,509
like a branded distribution company like

360
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,639
flow Cana

361
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:53,318
or if you're just providing things for

362
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,089
the shelves because they're two very

363
00:11:53,318 --> 00:11:57,549
different models and I think that one

364
00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:00,130
model serves this region a lot better

365
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:02,588
than the other but we were working with

366
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:04,299
small farmers and they were telling us

367
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,699
about some of their barriers in getting

368
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:09,278
to market and one of those barriers was

369
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:11,019
placed were places to safely store their

370
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,899
product where they had temperature and

371
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:15,669
humidity control it was a place to trim

372
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,559
their product where they felt like they

373
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:19,899
weren't in in risk of things getting

374
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,278
contaminated and it was a way to

375
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:23,708
actually get their product into

376
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,568
dispensaries without having to go to LA

377
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,818
and to San Diego in two different places

378
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:30,639
across the state and work with

379
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:32,528
dispensary owners one on one and so

380
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,810
hearing these barriers from working with

381
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:36,578
them as a delivery company as we started

382
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:38,349
to work more into wholesale we started

383
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:41,019
to think how do we address some of those

384
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,089
barriers how do we make it easier to get

385
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:44,589
these folks to market again what a

386
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:46,120
distributor is supposed to be thinking

387
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:48,279
about but this is before we were really

388
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,019
a distributor and so that was really the

389
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:52,688
idea for the campus in Redwood Valley

390
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:54,698
was the idea that if we built a facility

391
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:57,519
kind of like built go where the people

392
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:59,588
are philosophy if we went to where the

393
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,778
farmers were and we built a facility

394
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:03,730
that was licensed to do the

395
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:05,990
manufacturing the trimming the

396
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,570
processing the packaging the

397
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:11,060
testing and then we had a way to take

398
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:13,879
their product downstream and had people

399
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:16,369
on that end that could do the and brand

400
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:18,679
ambassador and go to the dispensaries

401
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:21,320
and do the social media and really push

402
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:23,000
the things that the farmers may have an

403
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,890
interested may not have an interest in

404
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,080
but are really busy being farmers and

405
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:29,958
going through the licensing process so

406
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,759
the idea to bring centralized processing

407
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:33,829
and bring this facility was really born

408
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,588
out of the needs we saw from the farmer

409
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:38,330
versus people saying you know what we

410
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:40,370
want to have a successful distribution

411
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,589
company we need to get source where do

412
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,690
we get source from and so I think that

413
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:47,089
that's why this type of distribution

414
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,940
model has the ability to actually

415
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:52,399
disrupt big agriculture and I think that

416
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:54,560
if distributors work together and really

417
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,480
focus on the types of brands and the

418
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,028
types of people that we want to see in

419
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,060
the marketplace and really advocating

420
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:04,549
for what quality truly is that quality

421
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:07,069
isn't necessarily THC level and quality

422
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:09,229
isn't necessarily orange hairs that it's

423
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:11,510
terpenoid and cannabinoid profile it's

424
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,430
how the product was grown it's the

425
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,980
amount of product that that person

426
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:18,109
produces a year if we have distributors

427
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,789
that understand this and advocate for

428
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,159
this that's going to make the whole

429
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:24,439
supply chain take the intent of the

430
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,389
farmer and translate it all the way

431
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,700
through to the market because when a

432
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:30,860
distributor is talking to a dispensary

433
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,740
owner about why sun-grown is better

434
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,930
about why Mendocino is special that's

435
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,180
going to translate into how that product

436
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:41,120
is marketed in the dispensary so I

437
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:44,000
absolutely think that distribution can

438
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,100
be a social advocacy if distributors

439
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,519
decide that they're going to stick to a

440
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:52,310
certain brand that their brand is small

441
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,600
producers for example so if you decide

442
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,338
that you're only going to distribute

443
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,709
people that produce under a certain

444
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:59,390
amount a year that's your brand and

445
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:01,519
anyone that knows that if they're

446
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:04,009
getting product from you that represents

447
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,078
something in the sphere of manufactured

448
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:08,299
products so I think it's important that

449
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,849
we use this these business structures

450
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:14,000
and these opportunities to continue to

451
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,820
try to create the landscape that we want

452
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,100
to see in the cannabis world and you

453
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,829
know playing off of something

454
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,440
Tim said about the global economy of

455
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:30,549
cannabis which is coming Canada wants to

456
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:32,860
own us all and they're all gonna be it's

457
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:34,508
beautiful I do but but but I'm telling

458
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,850
you they are really come that's where

459
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:38,289
big businesses right now and I feel like

460
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,399
we're fighting each other a lot in

461
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:41,259
California this is kind of my little

462
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,940
soapbox I feel like we're fighting each

463
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:44,500
other a lot in California and while

464
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,170
we're doing that like the Mounties are

465
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,720
coming and so we need to start banding

466
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:51,729
together and realize that in short order

467
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,360
cannabis is going to be a global

468
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:57,278
commodity when that happens the Emerald

469
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,028
triangle is going to be a teeny tiny

470
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:03,338
speck in that global landscape and if we

471
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:06,370
can establish now through a unified

472
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:09,970
voice that we are the quality that we

473
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:12,610
are the craft then we will have the

474
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,889
biggest share of the market for that

475
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:17,560
level of product the product Tim's

476
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:19,990
talking about you know the really world

477
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:22,929
premiere high-class product that we have

478
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:24,730
here in this region of the world so we

479
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:26,109
have to work together on that and we

480
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,789
have to work together through branding

481
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,100
we have to work together through

482
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:32,889
marketing I want to mention that I think

483
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,629
out on the table is forms to join the

484
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:37,060
Mendocino cannabis Industry Association

485
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:38,049
and risk let's say like a second about

486
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:42,008
that

487
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:43,419
so membership is $200 for a year and we

488
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:46,120
work with a lot of allied organizations

489
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:48,429
so we basically work on promotion and

490
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,339
branding of products that are produced

491
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:54,549
in Mendocino County so we work with the

492
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:56,680
county promotional alliances and tourism

493
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:58,899
boards we work with the Mendocino

494
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,219
Appalachians project and other groups

495
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:03,490
that are trying to work on specific

496
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,588
branding to this region we work on state

497
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:08,099
policies that enable things like event

498
00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:10,088
licenses and farmers to do direct sales

499
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,428
so you know if you're really interested

500
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:14,649
in Mendocino industry and really

501
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:16,360
protecting the brand of Mendocino County

502
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:20,740
I think it's important that we really

503
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:22,688
have unity so I think the last thing I

504
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,109
wanted to say was about the idea of

505
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:28,298
challenging big AG so right now

506
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:31,039
agriculture in the United States as many

507
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:33,440
of you know is very monoculture

508
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,549
it's not using diversification it's

509
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,460
definitely not using regenerative

510
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:41,359
practices and we're all suffering for

511
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:44,779
that cannabis because a prohibition has

512
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:47,709
had the benefit of having grown up in a

513
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:50,509
place of ingenuity creativity

514
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,309
sustainability having to be hidden and

515
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:54,710
being off the grid which is a pain at

516
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:57,349
the ass but at the same time a model for

517
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,299
how we should all move forward and so I

518
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:00,589
think it's important that also through

519
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:02,089
our distributor work through our

520
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:03,559
processing work through all the work

521
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:05,929
that we do at every level in business

522
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,819
license we really have to remember that

523
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,740
we have an opportunity to challenge the

524
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:11,450
agricultural model so we're trying to do

525
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,759
that with the centralized processing in

526
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,740
campus the idea that farmers have the

527
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,289
ability to scale up by sharing these

528
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,870
costs by moving these costs off the farm

529
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:24,440
is very very different than what we see

530
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:26,479
in industrialized agriculture as is the

531
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,610
push for regenerative farming practices

532
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,190
so we're working on a regenerated

533
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:33,949
standard for farmers to help them move

534
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,200
towards closed-loop systems to help them

535
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,029
learn how to use beneficial insects and

536
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,769
compost teas and the things that we know

537
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:42,079
are good for the earth and that we want

538
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:44,839
to be part of the brand of what is

539
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,789
quality cannabis so it really all fits

540
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:49,129
together and it all fits in really well

541
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:51,799
with Mendocino County a place that

542
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:53,570
banned all GMOs a place where everyone's

543
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,980
a craft farmer because no one's allowed

544
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:56,750
to have more than ten thousand square

545
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,210
feet which we should totally use in our

546
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,549
branding and so we have a huge

547
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:05,120
opportunity and so I'm hopeful that

548
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:07,940
companies like Flo Cana can be helpful

549
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:10,309
in not only building the brand but

550
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,860
really allowing you know a thousand

551
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:16,279
farmers to flourish underneath the

552
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:18,859
support because at the end of the day in

553
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:22,430
every single market across agriculture

554
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:25,129
it's the small the craft the organic the

555
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,740
small batch the individually loved and

556
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,750
produced product that is the quality and

557
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,700
that's who we are

558
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,769
here in Mendocino County the market may

559
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,170
not be reflective of that yet people are

560
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:37,579
still learning and that's why it's

561
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,590
really important we remember that we're

562
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:40,730
still activists and advocates even when

563
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:43,369
we're talking about this

564
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:46,069
so I will leave it there alright great

565
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:47,479
well thank you so much Amanda Ryman Tim

566
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:49,970
you sounded like you had a comment when

567
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,890
she was talking about I'm with her on

568
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,019
the mound he's coming right at us

569
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,310
I have nothing against Canadians I have

570
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:56,809
a lot of friends or Canadians we might

571
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:59,059
even have been in a partnership with

572
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:02,539
some Canadians but you're looking at

573
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:04,369
kanima Doge with Aurora became a 1.2

574
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:06,109
billion dollar company you're seeing

575
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,879
Kronos you're seeing these companies

576
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:09,979
that are becoming gigantic I was hearing

577
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,450
somebody there to buying airports so

578
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,309
they can transport this stuff around the

579
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,860
world not have people in their way

580
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:17,210
and so it's it really is a global market

581
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:18,469
that's coming and it's when you step

582
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,720
back and look at us we're sitting here

583
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,610
at 10,000 square feet and you know Santa

584
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,900
Barbara's got 15 acre farms and stuff

585
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:26,240
it's absolutely absurd that our

586
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,460
supervisors haven't moved to the half

587
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,870
acre level or even one acre really it's

588
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,640
ridiculous and just open up this whole

589
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:32,989
thing now we're here in the heart of the

590
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,970
Emerald triangle and we're being

591
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,370
restricted so heavily well the rest of

592
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,930
the world is just coming right at us and

593
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,309
my hats off the case is they they knew

594
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:43,100
what it was and they took advantage of

595
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:44,690
it and they're going to be the ones that

596
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:48,619
are be remembered as the kings of

597
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:52,130
cannabis and queens I have a question

598
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:55,579
about processing this year I mean this

599
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:58,670
year seems to be such a transition year

600
00:20:55,579 --> 00:21:02,990
and people will have their first light

601
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:06,080
up harvests coming in mid-july what's

602
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:10,700
going to happen to that product if

603
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:13,099
there's not enough processing farms that

604
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,100
are licensed to process their own that

605
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:17,839
can can process it all on their own

606
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:19,939
because of different restrictions with

607
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,859
with coating are there will flow Cana

608
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,720
have a processing center and do you

609
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:26,389
think there are enough around in

610
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,579
Mendocino both of you so we do have a

611
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,980
processing center in Redwood Valley that

612
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:33,500
opened officially about a week ago and

613
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,019
we're hiring so if anyone is interested

614
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,849
in being a processing a processor for

615
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:40,910
flow con you can go to our website and

616
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:42,949
fill out an application and we need

617
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:45,800
people because there's a lot of cannabis

618
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,259
to process the thing about processing is

619
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:50,779
that there are very strict standards

620
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:53,039
from Cal OSHA about worker environment

621
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:54,839
and so it's very different than

622
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,480
sitting at a table maybe even with a

623
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:59,309
little mask on you know it has to be a

624
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,079
completely clean room and people have to

625
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:04,470
be wearing gloves and hair nuts and

626
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:05,819
everything has to be sterile and so I

627
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,190
think that it's hard for a lot of

628
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:11,159
farmers to come up to that standard even

629
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:14,039
if the regulations allow them to trim on

630
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,900
their farm this season it's going to be

631
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:18,180
tough to do it in a way that's going to

632
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,850
satisfy some of the state requirements

633
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:23,759
so I think there should be more places

634
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:26,129
like flow Cana and I think it can be a

635
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,480
version of that so if there's a bunch of

636
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:30,150
farmers that you want to get together

637
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,490
and purchase a small building that's

638
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:35,460
kind of easy to build out into that type

639
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,680
of room and then share the expense that

640
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:41,370
may work better than trying to do make

641
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,560
each individual farm license to do that

642
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:45,449
so I think that there's ways that people

643
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,429
can try to work together but I think

644
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:51,720
that centralized processing is a really

645
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:54,269
good option for folks to lower the cost

646
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,579
and still build rooms to compliance

647
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:57,809
because it's partly one of the hardest I

648
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:00,329
mean more than distribution distribution

649
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:02,129
is putting it on a truck and driving it

650
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:04,500
from one place to another but the

651
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,770
processing you know that's actually

652
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,230
handling live plant material plant

653
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:12,029
material that's already been tested so

654
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,589
you know there's a there's a lot of

655
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:15,240
responsibility there that nothing

656
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:18,299
happens to it after the test has come

657
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,309
back clean and before it's been into the

658
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:24,000
consumers hands and a lot can happen in

659
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:27,440
that processing room so yeah it's it's a

660
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,440
lot there's a lot of machinery in there

661
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,000
Amanda you will you missed you all you

662
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:35,009
both missed I well no maybe you didn't

663
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,230
miss a very animated discussion before

664
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:39,390
lunch about distribution and how many

665
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:42,180
farmers are suffering because they've

666
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:45,509
got product they can't distribute it the

667
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:48,000
legal outlets are are in dispensaries

668
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:49,799
and retailing or not they are not being

669
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,279
able to get their product there so one

670
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:56,639
is how does a farmer get flow Cana to

671
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:59,069
distribute their craft cannabis and to I

672
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,020
wanted to ask if you are seeing the same

673
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:03,329
trend in manufacturing the Tim referred

674
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:06,450
to and are is flow can of getting into

675
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:06,769
oils and manufacturing and joining and

676
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,220
we

677
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:13,099
you're a plant Tim when you said you're

678
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:15,200
gonna emerald cup is gonna start a plant

679
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:16,429
a manufacturing plan and Willits yeah

680
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,230
well it's actually outside the city

681
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:21,740
limits it's the old Moser a garden

682
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:23,150
center it's one block behind the dump

683
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,259
out there waste management and it's

684
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,970
actually it doesn't feel like an

685
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:28,879
industrial park it's actually an eight

686
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,620
nap Baker you know three step up park

687
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,540
that you has a pond next to it and you

688
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:34,309
overlook the city so we're fortunate

689
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:36,589
it's gonna truly be an industrial park

690
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:38,750
so we're very excited about that and the

691
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:40,849
I'll let Amanda answer the questions you

692
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,309
asked her well first we need more places

693
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:46,639
like that so that's very very important

694
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:48,769
because we do need more outlets right

695
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,720
now I'll say flow kana is not taking on

696
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:52,730
any new farmers because we don't have

697
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,440
the capacity to process for any more

698
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,509
people than we're already processing for

699
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,340
that's how we're hiring more people so

700
00:24:56,509 --> 00:25:00,410
we can hire more people we can bring on

701
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:02,359
more farmers we plan to be able to bring

702
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,279
on anyone that wants to work with us as

703
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:06,469
long as we do a farm on it and see their

704
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:08,299
practices and all of that but we also

705
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:11,269
have a responsibility of the farmers we

706
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:13,669
currently work with to be quality in our

707
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:16,009
processing and if we try to bring on too

708
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,810
much that quality goes down stuff starts

709
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:20,660
to slip through the cracks and that's

710
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:22,519
not fair so because the regulations are

711
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,140
so strict and you know we're just now

712
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:26,150
going through our permanent state

713
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,560
licensing process you know we just have

714
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,810
to be really careful about our growth

715
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:32,059
that we don't hurt the integrity of what

716
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:34,609
we've already built but that being said

717
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:37,009
we do have a farmer relations team that

718
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:39,169
will take your information and as soon

719
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:41,269
as we start taking on more farmers will

720
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,590
contact you and schedule a farm visit

721
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:44,779
and that's the next step we come and

722
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:45,889
visit the farm we see your practices we

723
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:48,109
talk to you about what your expectations

724
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:50,060
are and then the answer the question

725
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:52,279
about manufacturing we are going to

726
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:54,289
start manufacturing on the facility we

727
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:55,849
have a partner out of Colorado it's

728
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:58,099
going to be coming in and doing white

729
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:59,809
label manufacturing so if our farmers

730
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:01,759
want to take part of their product and

731
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:03,379
turn that into an oil they'll be able to

732
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,720
get that done there they'll be able to

733
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,300
co-brand with flow Cana with the oil and

734
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,549
then eventually what I see is edible

735
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:13,309
products I mean you know you really have

736
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:16,639
very little idea what flour is in your

737
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:18,440
edible product and so I'm looking for

738
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,060
all the way down the supply chain where

739
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,259
you're buying a cookie and you know that

740
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:22,059
it

741
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:24,400
made with oil from huckleberry hill

742
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:29,200
farms and so that I think is really

743
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:30,700
important or ladies sativa farms and so

744
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,920
I think that that's really what we're

745
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,569
pushing towards is we want folks to know

746
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,600
that when you buy a product that has

747
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:40,240
flow kana oil as an ingredient that it

748
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:43,329
represents the highest quality because

749
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,380
it's representing this very unique group

750
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:49,269
of prep farmers so white label means

751
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,950
that the manufacturer isn't putting

752
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:53,410
their brand on it if they're basically

753
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:57,279
making it as an ingredient for the

754
00:26:53,410 --> 00:27:01,330
farmer and flow kana to co-brand so

755
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:03,309
Amanda its your would you say that model

756
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:05,559
that you're working with the farmers is

757
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:07,960
that you're contracting with a farmer

758
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:11,109
that you know what their quality is and

759
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:14,259
so you're testing and purchasing the

760
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:16,599
cannabis and then processing it at your

761
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:18,730
central processing plant or making it

762
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:21,519
into oil or edibles so all you've

763
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:23,140
already contracted to buy that cannabis

764
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:26,019
so that's one business model correct

765
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,870
right so I want to ask yes about that

766
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:31,240
and asked him if that's what his emerald

767
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:33,279
cup is doing as well so basically the

768
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,990
kind of the previous model was that the

769
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,539
farmer would sell their pound wholesale

770
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,339
and they would just walk away and then

771
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:41,019
whatever happened to that pound after

772
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:42,490
they sold it was whatever happened to it

773
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:43,750
it went into oils or it went into

774
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,750
something else or maybe it went into

775
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:49,029
nothing and so we work more with the

776
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,380
farmer on a contract basis now it's not

777
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:51,910
exclusive they don't have to sell

778
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,070
everything to us they can totally work

779
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,570
with other people but we give them up

780
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:58,839
and down payment in a negative

781
00:27:55,569 --> 00:28:01,240
percentage of that product at retail so

782
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:03,459
if that product is turned into a twenty

783
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,829
dollar cookie instead of only getting

784
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,360
the worth of the flower that went into

785
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:09,609
that cookie they're getting a percentage

786
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,959
of that cookie and that's the white

787
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:13,929
label piece so you're basically

788
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,480
purchasing it at the retail level that

789
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:19,180
cookie is co branded so that farmer gets

790
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,079
part of that revenue and so it's and

791
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:24,310
again we have a whole menu of services

792
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:28,119
so what are the biggest things we offer

793
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:30,009
honestly is storage storage is a huge

794
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:31,389
issue our farmers are seasonal farmers

795
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:33,460
they're not producing all year round

796
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,610
they're pulling one or two harvests but

797
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,039
they

798
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:37,719
need that to last all year so having

799
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:40,149
safe secure temperature and

800
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,589
humidity-controlled storage was one of

801
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,809
the biggest barriers we saw and

802
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:45,699
thankfully at the property in Redwood

803
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:48,069
Valley because it used to store wine it

804
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,069
has a ton of storage that's built

805
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:53,109
exactly for that type of product so that

806
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:56,159
I think that in the end of the day right

807
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:59,379
now that's probably the best thing

808
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,000
service that we can offer farmers in

809
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,280
terms of their news issues so that's a

810
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,929
separate contract or separate

811
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,210
relationship than saying you're gonna

812
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:10,120
purchase that story cannabis so there's

813
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:12,460
different belongs to them so it's on the

814
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:13,959
Shelf in the storage facility still

815
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,640
belongs to the farmer still their

816
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,298
product they can come get it at any time

817
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,130
take it away ok and Tim what is your

818
00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:22,839
business model there's a few things in

819
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,299
there one of them what you guys were

820
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:26,798
talking about earlier about the

821
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:28,720
situation and the cultivation and

822
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,700
distribution of stuff it's it's going to

823
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,960
be really even more of a mess because if

824
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,940
you look at it now it used to be if you

825
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,590
if you had a product and it dried up

826
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,850
during the summer at least during the

827
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:38,379
summer months you could move it out and

828
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:40,298
get a pretty good price for it and then

829
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,610
it became a shorter window because of

830
00:29:40,298 --> 00:29:43,900
the depths coming in now it's basically

831
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:46,389
if you don't sell your product between

832
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,100
April 1st and May 1st there's gonna be

833
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,710
50 million pounds of Depot's coming from

834
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:52,449
Santa Barbara and from Salinas and all

835
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,279
those wholesaler and box buyers are

836
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,679
already down there waiting we've had

837
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:58,269
people turning down stuff for 700-pound

838
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,040
because they know it's gonna be 604 a

839
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:01,690
grades and those people down there have

840
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:03,159
now put the time into their filtration

841
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,080
systems and into their greenhouses and

842
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,548
into their above-ground soil mixtures

843
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:08,319
it's not in the ground they're not gonna

844
00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:10,000
have the pesticide issues and so there's

845
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:12,250
gonna be a giant amount of Depot's

846
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,019
coming out that are so huge that you're

847
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,400
gonna watch whoever's got flowers right

848
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:16,808
now you're gonna be crushed if you don't

849
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,220
move that out in the next few weeks you

850
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:19,899
won't even bill it's gonna be 300 a

851
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,610
pound because there's so much coming and

852
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,780
we have that challenge because we can't

853
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:24,428
go out of this state we're the

854
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:27,548
breadbasket of this country we can grow

855
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:29,110
a ton cannabis flourishes we are going

856
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:30,970
to grow too much we've already done that

857
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:32,229
and no matter what Flo canna wants to do

858
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,419
in help they can only help so many

859
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,890
people if you've got 5000 farmers in

860
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:37,150
this county they're gonna you know if

861
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,160
they got a thousand farmers it

862
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:41,230
overwhelmed them okay the same with us

863
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,940
you know so you're really it's still dad

864
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,829
the Emerald cup you had 600 entries last

865
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,140
year it's just like it always was the

866
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:48,349
top

867
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,690
10 or 20% our fire the rest are B grade

868
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:52,159
and unfortunately most people in the

869
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,019
Triangle think they grow a grade but

870
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,130
they're growing B grade and until you

871
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,629
really get into those regenerative

872
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,940
farming practices and you get a high

873
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:01,190
grade soil system and you really know

874
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,779
how to how to grow a fine flower it's

875
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:04,519
gonna be a real challenge you know so

876
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:05,990
there's a whole thing coming in with the

877
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:08,150
depot's this year the markets that are

878
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,370
coming in what's gonna happen for us

879
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:11,840
like I said we're not trying to start

880
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,819
really large because we have four of our

881
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:17,240
own permitted farms our potential new

882
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:19,189
distributor has a million pounds of trim

883
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,690
under contract that's permitted right

884
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,430
now so we were talking about needing

885
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:24,200
30,000 pounds of shake to run our co2

886
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,549
machines for the year and he said oh by

887
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,039
the way I got a million pounds of

888
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:30,079
contract to trim that I can give you so

889
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,420
that's the size and scope that's going

890
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,099
to come at people and so just like

891
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,330
everything else we're gonna find the

892
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:37,339
finest products because when it's

893
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:39,230
powered by emerald-cut oils if somebody

894
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:40,730
uses an oil and does a white label we do

895
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,589
a product with them and it goes out it

896
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,000
says powered by miral cup oil we want to

897
00:31:42,589 --> 00:31:45,740
make sure that that's really it's

898
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,539
noticeable even down to the edibles

899
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,460
because you really notice that high that

900
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:51,470
subtlety and that you know it used to be

901
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,480
already hit all the low-grade in to the

902
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,069
end of the edibles or into places they

903
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,480
wouldn't get it you know but whether

904
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:58,129
it's a tincture and edible whatever else

905
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,930
you're really gonna want really fine

906
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:01,850
material because people are gonna know

907
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,769
the subtleties in the high you know it's

908
00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:04,909
gonna be there so all the way down the

909
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:06,680
board is going to be high-grade

910
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:08,000
materials and we're not looking to do

911
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,610
that much but we are looking for some

912
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,200
key people there's a few people around

913
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:14,750
that do some really incredible

914
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,090
cultivation and creation of flowers and

915
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,950

919
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:26,629

920
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:27,919
