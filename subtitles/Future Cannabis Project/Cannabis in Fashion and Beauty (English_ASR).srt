00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:25,400
[Music]

3
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:28,050
difference between style and fashion oh

4
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:31,500
you can't teach style

5
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,870
well you've sent Laurent said

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,850
whereas fashion is an art that's not--

7
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,669
notoriously difficult to keep up with

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,070
because trends change seasonally style

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,158
is impacted by much longer lasting

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,698
factors style is affected by religion

11
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:50,308
politics culture subculture weather body

12
00:00:47,698 --> 00:00:52,920
type profession upbringing and lots of

13
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:55,530
other things so Bravo yes that's what we

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,179
think too so this is a fashion in beauty

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,489
panel and beauty is sort of at the top

16
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,698
of this food chain because it's about

17
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:06,030
looking good about bringing beauty and

18
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:08,219
aesthetics into the world so we want to

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,039
talk about why it's important you may

20
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:14,539
notice this is our first and only to my

21
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:16,340
knowledge all-female panel so whoo

22
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,170
[Applause]

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,579
now one of the things that we wanted to

24
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,200
do is we really wanted to talk with you

25
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,879
about it so we're gonna go really

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,950
quickly everybody's gonna just tell you

27
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,658
who they are then we're gonna start

28
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,640
talking about fashion and it turns out

29
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,530
we have some different points of view

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,269
about it and then we invite you to have

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,430
your points of view and throw them in to

32
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:37,828
so we really want to participate with

33
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,590
you so I'm gonna start by letting my

34
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:41,789
panelists speak for themselves hi my

35
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,579
name is Debra Lindquist

36
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,969
I'm an eco-conscious clothing designer

37
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:50,250
I've been in business for 35 years next

38
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:51,989
month and I work with a combination of

39
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,828
organic sustainable and recycled

40
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:57,718
materials so the reason I'm here is I am

41
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:00,449
working with vintage cashmere and

42
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,789
vintage leather and I applique different

43
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,129
kind of iconic symbols on these things

44
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,459
but I've decided a few years ago that

45
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:11,849
the you know the hemp leaf was pretty so

46
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:15,509
I started to applique my leaves on on my

47
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:18,750
cashmere so I also work with other kinds

48
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:20,699
of fabrics like the sustainable mo doll

49
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,699
and my very very favorite sustainable

50
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:25,500
fabric is hemp I started working with

51
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:28,649
that in around 2004 I put it on the

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,310
runway when mercedes-benz and smashbox

53
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,030
were partners in LA Fashion Week and I

54
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,280
ended up putting a

55
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,419
wedding dress at the end of that runway

56
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,568
show which ended up in the USA Today

57
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:45,699
newspaper in a story about industrial

58
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:48,579
hemp so here's my wedding dress on my

59
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:51,609
model at the finale of my fashion show

60
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:55,030
in this industrial hemp article I think

61
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,280
that was about 2005 so I've been in this

62
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,719
for a long time my mission is to really

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,330
inspire people to care about the

64
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,129
environment I'm really concerned about

65
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,410
the planet and the people who live on it

66
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:08,560
and my business is focused on

67
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:12,639
sustainability for that reason I hey

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,890
guys I'm Brandi and I am from Canada I'm

69
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,679
here from Toronto and I'm the founder of

70
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:20,199
Evo beauty we have been around now for

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,060
five years we are a non cannabis

72
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:25,238
cannabis company if that makes any sense

73
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,250
and so I started the company with a

74
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,890
mission to break stigmas and create a

75
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,209
more conscious future and that was so

76
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:32,799
important to me when I started the

77
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,170
company because I started the company

78
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,450
while living in a woman shelter so you

79
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:40,208
can imagine my life is drastically

80
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:42,009
different five years later and and

81
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:44,829
recently I just sold a part of the

82
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:47,500
company to Aurora and so they're our

83
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:50,019
partners in the cannabis and sector and

84
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,639
cannabis was just a tool in our vast

85
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,739
tool belt to create a more conscious

86
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:56,078
future which is why I say we're not a

87
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,420
cannabis company and there were four

88
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,310
main pillars that I was focusing on in

89
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,889
creating a more conscious future and it

90
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,439
just so happened that cannabis was a

91
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,298
tool that addressed all of those and if

92
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,219
it was lavender that could address all

93
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:12,099
of those I would be in a very different

94
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:14,680
room right now but um those four pillars

95
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:17,798
were social justice which i think is a

96
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,560
huge huge huge component of cannabis

97
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:23,859
that is often not spoken about enough

98
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,978
and another one is the excess use of

99
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:29,949
animal by-products in cosmetics is huge

100
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:32,978
and also the excess use of plastics and

101
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:34,599
then also transparency in the cosmetic

102
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:36,550
world as well with I'm actually watching

103
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,830
somebody put on their lip gloss right

104
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:43,910
now do you know what's in that

105
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:45,919
oh good good good but it's often a

106
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,680
challenge I'm in cosmetics that you're

107
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,449
unsure of what's in it I'm so I'm being

108
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,639
from Canada you just heard them talk

109
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:54,709
about the man who is up previously

110
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,209
talked about the regulations and how you

111
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:58,549
literally have to put on a marshmallow

112
00:04:56,209 --> 00:05:00,259
suit before you go in and you know who's

113
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,420
getting in and out you know who touched

114
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:04,279
that plant you know every single thing

115
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,189
about that and that provides a lot of

116
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:09,889
transparency to non cannabis consumers

117
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:12,110
who really the consumer of Evo beauty

118
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:15,289
are not cannabis consumers in fact most

119
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,600
of them are not for it yet and so we

120
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,430
were addressing that as well and then

121
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,700
towards the planet we were actually able

122
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,740
to reduce the use of plastic by 45% by

123
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:27,589
reinforcing our plastic with hemp fibers

124
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,449
so and cannabis is just a tool that we

125
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:31,039
use but we are not a cannabis company

126
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:33,139
and then we've really leaned on our

127
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,030
partners at aurora and others in the

128
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:36,319
industry to be the experts in that area

129
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:40,129
and we just provide a new platform

130
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,860
through our mass distribution in Canada

131
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:44,659
the US Australia and the EU as well and

132
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,280
we're we're partners with Sephora as

133
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,950
well so it certainly gives us a

134
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:51,469
different different type of consumer to

135
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:55,659
introduce them to the magic of cannabis

136
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,660
that isn't in the capacity of smoking

137
00:05:56,769 --> 00:06:03,769
hello hi my name is ELISA marques a

138
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,439
stage name miss Marquez I'm a burlesque

139
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:09,680
performer and I'm the artistic director

140
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:13,310
of a show called marijuana madness it's

141
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,769
a live show that combines burlesque live

142
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,870
jazz music and theatre to tell the true

143
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:21,189
story of cannabis prohibition during the

144
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:24,800
Jazz era so all the music in the show is

145
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:26,870
music from the Jazz era the tail of the

146
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,670
show tells the story of cannabis

147
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,639
prohibition and how it targeted jazz

148
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:34,790
musicians the racist roots of cannabis

149
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,399
prohibition during the 1930s I've been

150
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,980
doing I'm a professional dancer who has

151
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:42,620
been focused on burlesque for about the

152
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,680
past seven years about four years ago I

153
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:48,079
decided to start implementing cannabis

154
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,350
into my burlesque acts as a form of

155
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,319
cannabis advocacy to try and change the

156
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,900
stigma

157
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,490
what people think cannabis consumers

158
00:06:54,899 --> 00:07:01,469
look and act like so I actually my form

159
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,710
of agna advocacy is actually wearing

160
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:08,010
cannabis on myself in my costumes and in

161
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:11,370
my acts I'm partnered for marijuana

162
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:14,459
madness with a great organization called

163
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:18,000
grass-fed and they provide amazing

164
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:20,039
cannabis live events their approach to

165
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,490
cannabis is more like a fine wine

166
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:27,450
tasting so all of our events are fancy

167
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,759
we encourage people to dress up the it's

168
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:32,519
a smoke-free environment so it's also a

169
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,509
very health conscious company also at

170
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,939
our events

171
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:39,240
it's a smoke-free environment that is

172
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:41,370
only vaping and micro dose edibles and

173
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,769
I'm very proud of the show in the sense

174
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,199
that is the first live event and

175
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:48,569
burlesque show of its kind that only

176
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,939
doesn't focus on cannabis in the

177
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:53,219
storyline but also provides a cannabis

178
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:59,069
speakeasy where you can actually consume

179
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:02,010
cannabis at the live events and she's

186
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,490
hello everyone my name is Whitney Bailey

187
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,830
and I'm CEO and founder of apothecary

188
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:26,160
brands and actually came to the canvas

189
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:29,939
space I guess differently than a lot of

190
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,820
other people five years ago I was a

191
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:38,000
senior vice president at entertainment

192
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:42,330
company but I had a health situation I

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,669
was diagnosed with anxiety and I tried a

194
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,530
million different drugs that my doctor

195
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:47,399
prescribed to me and none of them worked

196
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:51,720
and offhand

197
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,569
she said why don't you try cannabis and

198
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,889
actually I was in shock and awe because

199
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,010
Nancy Reagan had told me to say no to

200
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:59,080
drugs

201
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:03,220
I wasn't why would a Nancy lie to me I

202
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,830
said and I did a lot of research and I

203
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,920
learned a ton about the space but what I

204
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,240
did not like after coming into it was I

205
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,719
didn't find a lot of things that spoke

206
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,560
to me

207
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,899
spoke to me as a mother as a female as

208
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,179
an executive as a member of the you know

209
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,769
the community that I I was in and also

210
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:23,469
when I looked at the other people that I

211
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:26,350
knew used cannabis they were all a lot

212
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,850
like me and they kept their wine in the

213
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,680
wine fridge and they kept liquor and

214
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,330
bars and they kept cigars and humidors

215
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,370
and we all kept our high in cannabis and

216
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,950
a shoe box out of our beds

217
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,539
and I was like why why is that that

218
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,879
compromises the experience it

219
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:42,490
compromises to me the use of it why am I

220
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:44,200
saying that this medicine is so useful

221
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,940
to me and now I'm going to put it in a

222
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,379
place of shame underneath my bed when

223
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,450
it's not safe it's not kept in the

224
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:54,789
humidity and I decided you know like any

225
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,770
any high-quality single mother to quit

226
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:58,809
my job so my house and start a company

227
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:00,850
and that's what I did I started

228
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:02,019
apothecary three years ago

229
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,820
and since then we went through the

230
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:06,519
canopy Business Accelerator we've raised

231
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:10,720
seed around and we've been in sales for

232
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:13,029

233
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,970
percent up from last year and

234
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,799
encouraging people to think about the

235
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,250
way that they store use and imbibe

236
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:24,759

242
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:39,129
just ask another question of you one

243
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:42,089
thing I want to observe is the character

244
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:44,379
of the audience changed a lot here I

245
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:47,590
have to observe that there's a lot of

246
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:50,710
women here now and much fewer men so men

247

fashion world let me ask you do you how

249
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,879
many people in here are thinking about

250
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,100
oh I have a business and I might you

251
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,139

252
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:06,370

253
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:10,000

255
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,438

258
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:26,438

259
00:11:24,938 --> 00:11:28,389
there just shout them out things you'd

260
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:31,899
like us to make sure that we cover that

261
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:33,909
you're interested in about fashion ok

262
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,409
it's on us then all right I'm gonna kick

263
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:37,600
it off with the question but honestly

264
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:39,610
think about it because we'd really like

265
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,709
to talk with you about how we can be

266
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,259
helpful to you and so our first question

267
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:47,799
my first question is we heard a lot

268
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:49,089
about how cannabis came into businesses

269
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,599
there are businesses and now they've

270
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:55,480
incorporated cannabis but how can

271
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,120
fashion influence cannabis then the the

272
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,639
cannabis industry is is it important is

273
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,310
it not important should we be thinking

274
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,278
about it what do you think let's start

275
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:11,588
with each ask each of our panelists how

276
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:15,338
they think fashion can help us in moving

277
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:18,670
this industry forward ok fashion can

278
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:21,189
help move this industry forward by you

279
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:24,458
know people embracing I think for from

280
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:27,278
my point of view I'm working with hemp

281
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:29,438
so in the very beginning I when I first

282
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:32,438
started working with hemp journalists

283
00:12:29,438 --> 00:12:35,860
would say things like well how can you

284
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:40,599
be making sexy clothes out of hemp

285
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:44,889
when it's kind of scratchy and shapeless

286
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:48,610
garments and boring kind of clothes and

287
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:50,350
I was making bustiers and I have a kind

288
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,509
of burlesque connection with miss

289
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,629
Marquez I was doing Pussycat Dolls so I

290
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:56,980
was doing their costumes and I took it

291
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:59,409
all the while I was doing bustiers

292
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,480
before I did them for Pussycat Dolls but

293
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:04,899
I started putting my hemp into bustier

294
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:08,019
is like in a wedding dress kind of theme

295
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:09,909
so they were so confused at first and

296
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:11,470
just didn't know what to do with me and

297
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:14,019
they decided well we'll call you the

298
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,240
sexy eco designer which was fine with me

299
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:18,339
instead of the dumpy you know eco

300
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,750
designer so it's kind of you know

301
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,910
there's a stigma to

302
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,710
how this material could be used for

303
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:26,899
instance you know I'm not familiar with

304
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:30,860
it well gee look at how drapey and

305
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:33,019
lovely and and sensual this fabric is in

306
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,769
terms of really wearing the the leaf

307
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:38,029
which I've put on things some people are

308
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:40,189
a little afraid of it because they don't

309
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:42,679
want to be stigmatized but I think it's

310
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,570
a pretty leaf and I applique flowers on

311
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:47,959
things and it's just another leaf I like

312
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:49,340
maple leaves too and palm leaves so you

313
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,580
know as a plant I think it's a great

314
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,649
plant it has so many uses from the

315
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:57,379
industrial point of view of hemp and to

316
00:13:54,649 --> 00:14:00,079
the cannabis point of view for medicine

317
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:03,409
and so on so does that answer your

318
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:06,139
question sure for now so again how does

319
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:09,529
how can fashion help us move this

320
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:14,240
industry forward fashion and style and a

321
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:16,389
focus on that so I think that it's in my

322
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,159
opinion I think my answer kind of

323
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:21,319
crosses over just fashion and beauty and

324
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:25,159
style but I think cannabis is really

325
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,870
similar to Buber in a way and if you

326
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:29,240
would have said to me you know ten years

327
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:31,100
ago hey B you're gonna get in the back

328
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,240
of an unmarked car with a man driving

329
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,560
you're not gonna talk to him who's gonna

330
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,200
take you to where you want to go just

331
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:38,899
trust him I'd be like no I'm not getting

332
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,210
the back of that man's car but today

333
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:43,159
like I took an uber here and anytime I'm

334
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,600
in Vancouver which is like the only city

335
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:46,129
on the planet that doesn't have BRR I

336
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,200
don't know what to do with myself it's

337
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:50,330
hard to live without Oh BRR now and I

338
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,850
think that it's very similar with with

339
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:55,639
cannabis as well so from our perspective

340
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,970
we actually did a survey in April in the

341
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,970
US and it was between Sephora we were

342
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:05,330
part of their accelerate and so we did a

343
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:08,060
survey with 2000 Sephora consumers and

344
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,590
we asked them and you know how do you

345
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:12,049
want isn't important to you to reduce

346
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,310
the use of plastic is it important to

347
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:15,559
you to reduce the use of animal

348
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:18,139
by-products and animal testing and is it

349
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:20,389
important to you to have transparency in

350
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:22,309
your ingredients and across the board

351
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:23,960
everybody's like yes but then when we

352
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:25,819
said would you have cannabis in your

353
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,990
products across the board the majority

354
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,149
of people said like

355
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,339
No and so I think that if you're

356
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:34,399
addressing people's problems in any

357
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:35,990
industry then it's more likely to be

358
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,429
able to progress that forward and it

359
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:41,690
will take some time to break the stigma

360
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:43,069
but we've now done what they have asked

361
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,589
in the products to address their

362
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,860
problems and then can then say surprise

363
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:50,930
it's cannabis and I think that that also

364
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,000
helps break the stigma and it also helps

365
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:54,469
move the industry the cosmetic industry

366
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,778
forward by addressing those problems

367
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,759
that there are major problems to those

368
00:15:56,778 --> 00:16:06,350
people whether they believe in cannabis

369
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:08,838
or not jumping off of what you were

370
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,480
saying Deborah Pussycat Dolls is a great

371
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,610
example actually because you know back

372
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,220
in the 2000s and Pussycat Dolls were a

373
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,019
thing BCA's we're like quite as

374
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,589
fashionable as like now you see them all

375
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,329
the time

376
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:22,910
and I think with fashion it's important

377
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,920
to note the trends of things and how

378
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:26,569
people like you know Lady Gaga or the

379
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,329
Pussycat Dolls like being a professional

380
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,410
dancer that's worked in the commercial

381
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,920
industry

382
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:36,799
I see how the Wardrobe they put on us

383
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,360
you might wear in a music video and then

384
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:41,328
all of a sudden it becomes the next

385
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,800
trending thing as a burlesque performer

386
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:47,599
that's what got me so excited about

387
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:49,759
using my platform to promote cannabis I

388
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,940
started looking for costume pieces that

389
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,889
had pasties or you know a g-string that

390
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,560
had a cannabis leaf on it couldn't find

391
00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:00,799
it didn't exist create it at myself now

392
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:04,308
I see at other places so not to like

393
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:06,799
tout my own you know but like as a

394
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:09,379
burlesque performer it's very exciting

395
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,250
to get really creative obviously I'm a

396
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,929
bit eccentric

397
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,660
my hair color kind of shows that a

398
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:17,329
little bit and if I can encourage people

399
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,160
to be creative and eccentric with their

400
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:21,379
own wardrobe because I'm wearing a

401
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:26,990
cannabis leaf on my head that makes me

402
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:29,420
pretty excited I personally think that

403
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,609
fashion has the ability to really help

404
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,529
us distinguish this space

405
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:35,329
I think we have the ability to bring new

406
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:38,359
people into the cannabis space by

407
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:40,339
broadening out what we see as cannabis

408
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:42,319
you know if we work here Tim here

409
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:45,109
ago people were much more you know

410
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,720
thinking about stoner culture we got you

411
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:49,399
know college kids smoking behind the gym

412
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,200
and that you know stoner guy who can't

413
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,870
remember all these stigmas and

414
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,640
stereotypes over here but as we have the

415
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:57,229
ability in fashion in the way that we

416
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,240
present things the way that we brand

417
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,220
things we have the ability to really

418
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,870
broaden out and make people feel more

419
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,610
comfortable in this space because

420
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:08,479
personally for me I want to be selling

421
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:09,829
you know cannabis not only to you know

422
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,009
the people that are already in the space

423
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:15,109
but I want the 45 year old white woman

424
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:17,839
in Kansas to feel welcome here I want

425
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:19,699
the you know 65 year old black mother

426
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,589
who has arthritis to feel welcome here

427
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,019
and we need to be able to show them you

428
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:25,339
know this space as where they are meet

429
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,259
them where they are and we have that

430
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:28,639
ability through cannabis just in the

431
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:31,069
same way as cannabis is not one size

432
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,049
fits all what I smoke might not have the

433
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:34,759
same it is no benefits for you as it

434
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:36,980
does for me my anxiety works with

435
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:38,419
sativas not indicas you know everything

436
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,149
is very personalized and we have the

437
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:42,919
ability to bring that personalization to

438
00:18:41,148 --> 00:18:45,798
people through fashioning the way that

439
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,809
we present this to them and open them up

440
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:51,019
to the plan so fashion makes things

441
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:52,908
accessible to so one of the things I

442
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:54,398
believe from what you were all saying is

443
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:56,750
you know fashion it's been democratized

444
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:59,479
used to be that it was this rarefied

445
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:02,509
thing and only the very wealthy could do

446
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,589
it and then there was tars a you know so

447
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:05,829
there was a it's really been

448
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:08,480
democratized I think every American

449
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:12,259
anyway has gotten quite used to good

450
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,380
design so panelists what do you think's

451
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:18,528
not living up to the good design you

452
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,659
know who where are we in the evolution

453
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:22,730
whether it's kind of its packaging the

454
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:25,278
design of the products that can the

455
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:28,399
consumers you know where are we where do

456
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:30,460
we need to go let's start over here I

457
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:34,038
was just having a conversation today

458
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:37,159
about how you know as much as we work

459
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:39,230
and and do I think as a community try

460
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:42,490
our best to put our best foot forward I

461
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:47,190
think that we still have a lot of

462
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:50,190
objectification of women and a lot of

463
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:53,278
the billboards that you see on the side

464
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:55,200
of the road I saw a picture today of two

465
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:56,700
women's asses with the Cannabis you know

466
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,110
company's name on the back and I'm not

467
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,450
naming any names but I feel that that's

468
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:02,250
absolutely ridiculous in this space

469
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,480
where we have more female CEOs than

470
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,980
anywhere else that we feel comfortable

471
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,750
and objectifying women in that matter

472
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:11,370
[Applause]

473
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,869
but we're talking about women being one

474
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:14,579
of the fastest growing groups coming

475
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:15,928
into this space that's how you want to

476
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:17,668
welcome them in and all the people who

477
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:19,230
said oh you know we're scared of

478
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:21,210
cannabis and this is what we're showing

479
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,798
them I think that you know as a

480
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,870
community it's our job to be able to

481
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,190
stand up and say you know that's not

482
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:28,199
what we want to stand for and I

483
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,639
understand that there's a range that you

484
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,440
know just like there's pop off and Greg

485
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:33,240
ruse that there are gonna be brands that

486
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,480
fall between the range but I just think

487
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,599
that that is just unnecessary and people

488
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,038
have to stand up and say so or we end up

489
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,349
with more of that so there's the

490
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,569
objectification of women which we pretty

491
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:47,939
much object to because we all clap but

492
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:50,939
what about the other things like stoners

493
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:53,210
and big joints and you know what do you

494
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:57,360
think about what else you're saying

495
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:59,730
anybody well I can't say from what I was

496
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,709
speaking about earlier about marijuana

497
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:04,230
madness providing a cannabis speakeasy

498
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,940
we have chose specifically to make it a

499
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,519
smoke-free environment so there aren't

500
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,769
any bongs there aren't any big ripped

501
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:13,798
joints you know that sort of thing and

502
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:17,878
not that I don't enjoy those things but

503
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:20,638
I do think it is important to really

504
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:22,769
showcase and provide people with an

505
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:27,148
experience that's not that typical

506
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:29,308
cannabis culture stigma that we

507
00:21:27,148 --> 00:21:30,449
associate from you know like we were

508
00:21:29,308 --> 00:21:32,579
saying earlier the Cheech and Shawn

509
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,980
movies which I love but remember that

510
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:36,658
was a parody and when you take that

511
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,750
parody and make that your real life

512
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:43,070
that's that's not doing anyone in the

513
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,069
cannabis industry any favors

514
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,769
so I wish that we could say the same in

515
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:54,710
Canada and it is very rare actually that

516
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:57,769
we have female CEOs or female director

517
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:59,390
roles in cannabis in Canada and which is

518
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:03,379
interesting because it is the country

519
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:05,930
leading cannabis right now and so I do

520
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,309
kind of understand a little bit of the

521
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,930
sexual ization if we're I don't agree

522
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:10,940
with it like I feel like I don't have

523
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,990
that opposite opinion but I do also

524
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,730
agree that if that there's there's a

525
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,670
long way to go within that and I think

526
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,710
that in changing and who's sitting on

527
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,539
those boards and not saying that it

528
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,920
needs to be women but it needs to be

529
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:26,839
people there that are there for the

530
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,880
right reasons and actually something

531
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:30,259
that I don't know if this has to do so

532
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,210
much with fashion or answers the

533
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:34,069
question or not but kind of going back

534
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:37,250
to the social justice and fashion has a

535
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:40,759
huge part and cultural changes and it

536
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:42,380
has a huge part in societal like uproars

537
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,569
and how we can change things and we

538
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,059
definitely use fashion and beauty to to

539
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:49,490
like protest our opinions in a very

540
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:50,960
positive way and so I think that some of

541
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,970
the things that we need to focus on is

542
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,679
changing who's in the room and what

543
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,769
we're talking about and one of them

544
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:01,009
majorly being a social justice I'm on a

545
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:03,558
panel in Toronto tomorrow morning that I

546
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:06,529
am on this panel with a man who now is

547
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:09,740
the CEO of a cannabis company which

548
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:11,629
awesome but he was also a police officer

549
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,569
in a ranking role that put most of those

550
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:16,850
people behind bars for marijuana crimes

551
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:19,939
so I think that there's an interesting

552
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:22,579
aspect there to be addressed and I think

553
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:25,250
that fashion and beauty is a really cool

554
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:27,349
platform to be able to and kind of I

555
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,299
don't like the word protest because I'm

556
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:31,939
certainly that sometimes has a negative

557
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:33,799
connotation to I'm being angry and

558
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,019
that's not necessarily how we progress

559
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:37,220
and move forward either but I think

560
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:40,429
fashion and beauty has a really strong

561
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:43,730
space because it's on visual and so I

562
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:47,570
think that it depends

563
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:49,640
that have like positive opinions towards

564
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:51,710
cultural change and societal change and

565
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,470
I think that's when we start to see less

566
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:57,250
naked houses on

567
00:23:53,470 --> 00:24:00,038
on Billboard's Deborah do you want to

568
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:03,940
talk sure well I have a sustainable

569
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:06,158
fashion brand eco-conscious and when

570
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,870
there was a German when finally there

571
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,590
was terminology for what I'd been doing

572
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:13,689
for quite a while since 1983 actually it

573
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:16,269
was probably around 2004 and all these

574
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,129
names for what do we call this we call

575
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:21,870
it green we call it sustainable we had

576
00:24:18,128 --> 00:24:24,519
eco friendly eco conscious ethical so

577
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:27,250
back then it was about to change the

578
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:30,308
world people were jumping onto the green

579
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:34,058
bag bandwagon like it was you know the

580
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:36,250
next greatest thing sometimes not really

581
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:38,048
being true to all of it there was green

582
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,298
washing like oh I'm doing this but I'm

583
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:41,589
not really doing this so you know there

584
00:24:40,298 --> 00:24:43,658
are many aspects to a sustainable

585
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:46,990
business it's about you know the product

586
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:50,169
the materials use the way you process

587
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:52,808
that the your production methods all

588
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:55,059
comes down to carbon footprint but the

589
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:57,700
main objective is to save the planet

590
00:24:55,058 --> 00:25:00,278
right and keep our environment healthy

591
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,679
and keep ourselves healthy as people so

592
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:04,778
in the last decade what's taken over

593
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:07,179
something happened we had an economic

594
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:09,339
crisis and everybody decided that well

595
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:12,850
we're just gonna buy fast fashion so it

596
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:15,939
gained a gigantic foothold with mega

597
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:18,398
brands giving us options of new fashion

598
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,350
every day in these big stores which you

599
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:21,849
probably know there four of them I won't

600
00:25:20,349 --> 00:25:24,788
mention their names because we all know

601
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:27,219
them but they've taken over the world

602
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:31,480
actually and they've created so much

603
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:34,028
chaos and so much unhealthy conditions

604
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,370
for the people who make the product and

605
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:38,230
also just it for the environment in

606
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:41,500
general because it's really true the

607
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:43,480
butterfly's wings do affect the world as

608
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,849
a typhoon halfway around the world

609
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,269
small changes being really big results

610
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:51,398
so now after so many businesses have

611
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:53,079
been operating in the shadows for 10

612
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:56,109
years a lot of my friends have dropped

613
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:58,058
out because they couldn't make it retail

614
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:59,769
stores have closed so here we are back

615
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:02,079
again talking about sustainability and

616
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:04,298
interestingly enough it's involving

617
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,480
that's involving cannabis and it's

618
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:06,980
involving half

619
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,399
at least for me I'm the Brent you know

620
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:13,700
I'm a brand basically so I'm really

621
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:16,489
proud to say that what I do out of out

622
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:19,940
of hemp is is really high-end fashion

623
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:23,359
it's you know wedding it's it's really

624
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:26,298
feminine sustainable and it's not

625
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,278
overtly well it's sexy but it's not

626
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:29,418
overtly sexy not like those you know

627
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:30,919
billboard you're talking about I know

628
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:33,350
exactly which one that is

629
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:36,380
I'm a little tired of all that you know

630
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:39,349
let's just let's be beautiful as women

631
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,929
and we can have all that you know as

632
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:43,219
part of us as well but you know think

633
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:46,759
about the greater picture you know what

634
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:49,970
are we really trying to do here now jump

635
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:52,339
in on that real quick just I like to

636
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:54,319
what you just said about women are

637
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:57,408
beautiful because I think not

638
00:26:54,319 --> 00:27:00,829
necessarily butts are not beautiful but

639
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:03,049
its context and context is everything

640
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:06,230
and so what you're describing is very

641
00:27:03,048 --> 00:27:08,028
different than you know what I do I'm a

642
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:10,179
burlesque performer absolutely sounds

643
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:13,250
like porn you know what when you see it

644
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:15,590
it's the same thing difference between

645
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:19,220
the objectification and sexual ization

646
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:21,019
yeah in this space and you know because

647
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,339
when you show that without you know

648
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:23,450
you're not showing their face you don't

649
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:25,398
care about that person you're not

650
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:27,710
marketing to you that girl you're shit

651
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:31,788
there's some weed off the back of her

652
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:33,620
ass yeah exactly I just wanted to throw

653
00:27:31,788 --> 00:27:36,259
that what you're saying it's not

654
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:38,558
objectification of the person because

655
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:41,329
the person when you do your burlesque

656
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:44,000
because you're you're the the person

657
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:48,369
what what's amazing about burlesque is

658
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,380
it's a woman's choice right to utilize

659
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:55,369
sexual ization in her performance in the

660
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:58,070
way that is parody is comedy what I love

661
00:27:55,369 --> 00:28:02,888
about burlesque is because as I get to

662
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:05,898
use that sexual platform to make people

663
00:28:02,888 --> 00:28:08,689
reflect on their own insecurities about

664
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:11,418
sex in general and that's a big reason

665
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:13,580
why I loved bringing cannabis and so

666
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:16,278
that too because just like sex has a big

667
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:18,039
stigma and people are very uncomfortable

668
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:20,140
with nudity and that sort

669
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:23,230
Thayne so are people really

670
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:25,350
uncomfortable with cannabis but yeah I

671
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:28,089
totally agree with you guys on all the

672
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:30,849
objectification I just wanna they're out

673
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:33,879
their butts are beautiful in the right

674
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:37,689
context so we've heard about social

675
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,610
justice ecological sense the sensitivity

676
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:41,680
we've heard about gender parody and

677
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:43,659
there's a movie have have you all heard

678
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,330
about the women of weed Mary Jane's the

679
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,890
women the weed movie so what's great

680
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:50,409
about that I'm in that movie show a

681
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:53,440
little piece what's great about that

682
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:55,810
movie is that she set out to find out

683
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,480
whether women in the industry had these

684
00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:00,940
things in mind and you guys clearly all

685
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,940
have those things in mind and so maybe

686
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,130
it's a new industry because women have

687
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,650
such a leadership position in cannabis

688
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,540
now maybe we have an opportunity to

689
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:13,570
create a new industry that has that

690
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:16,089
those kinds of sensibilities so the

691
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:19,659
question then is if we do have that

692
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:23,019
opportunity how do we make it real what

693
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:24,910
do we have to do to keep this going I am

694
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:27,819
really eager to answer that question we

695
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:29,650
need more men in these seats the fact

696
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:32,980
that there is more women in these seats

697
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:35,820
now than there was before unless men

698
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:38,529
that's what we need we need to all

699
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:43,000
encompass be working towards one goal

700
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:45,190
together not have the women's panels but

701
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,140
have women on the panels because they

702
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:50,019
deserve their spot there and they earned

703
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:51,820
it and we need to stop say forgetting

704
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:53,710
those things and be all one together

705
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:56,230
working towards a common goal I think

706
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,329
that's how we really get there so propel

707
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,240
it by bringing men into the ideas that

708
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:02,980
were putting forward is what you're

709
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,930
saying and men have some amazing ideas

710
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,349
too like I'll be honest my board of

711
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:10,420
directors is primarily men in fact

712
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:12,069
solely men and that's not something I'm

713
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,080
proud of it's just that they really

714
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:16,869
earned their spots there and really

715
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:20,049
moved this movement forward and we are

716
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:21,609
our offices on Bay Street in Toronto

717
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:24,879
which is like the wall street of Canada

718
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:27,369
and they're coming in for one purpose

719
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,720
which is to make capital gains in the

720
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,668
kind of

721
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,140
industry and I'm okay that they're

722
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:32,700
coming in for that purpose but when

723
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,009
they're sitting around our boardroom

724
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,650
table they're coming in and saying hey

725
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:39,839
Bea tell me about me - what's that

726
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:43,080
tell me about women in cannabis tell me

727
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,609
your opinion on this cannabis ad and I

728
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,579
think that having those mutual

729
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:48,689
conversations together is a really

730
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:52,379
really big movement in that direction

731
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:54,690
and and it's it's unfortunate that a lot

732
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:57,600
of men exit the conversation when it's a

733
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:59,070
panel of women I you know before I

734
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,428
talked about the fact that you know

735
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:04,769
there's more female CEOs and cannabis

736
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:06,480
than any other industry in the US but

737
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:07,259
that number has been you know trailing

738
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,450
downwards

739
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:11,819
I think young by 10 percent without that

740
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:14,759
26 percent yeah and then also when you

741
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:15,960
look at it those are not the companies

742
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:17,669
that are getting the majority of funding

743
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,798
they're not the ones who have the money

744
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:21,360
to buy the billboards and I think that

745
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:23,129
it's important that we have a seat at

746
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,019
that table and I you know I talk this

747
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,270
not just for women but also for people

748
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:29,879
of color because if you haven't noticed

749
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:31,470
I am a woman of color and there's just

750
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,750
not enough of us here in this industry

751
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,308
having a word in this industry and you

752
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,380
know we come from communities that would

753
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:39,298
be disproportionately disenfranchised by

754
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,460
war on drugs and we don't have a seat at

755
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:43,740
the table either and so being able to I

756
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,620
think to have those conversations you

757
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,390
know and at a higher level being in that

758
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:51,359
c-suite where those decisions are made

759
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:53,400
become a very powerful thing and so you

760
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,229
know to piggyback on that I think that

761
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,909
it's great that we're here I love the

762
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:03,058
fact that we have so many women I want

763
00:31:56,909 --> 00:32:05,309
to see them have more power so how do we

764
00:32:03,058 --> 00:32:06,839
help everybody in this audience get a

765
00:32:05,308 --> 00:32:09,089
seat at the table what do you have to do

766
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,849
how are we gonna help them and how are

767
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:14,298
we all gonna do it anybody I have any

768
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:14,298
ideas

769
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:22,140
I think as far as the ethics of the

770
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:26,558
advertising you know maybe reach out to

771
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:29,049
some of these organizations and get the

772
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:32,529
message out that if you wanted maybe

773
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:37,420
educate what is you know and every and

774
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:42,369
anyone have change in like you said and

775
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:45,490
as far as Brittany talking about the old

776
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:46,989
man of CEOs and this is the judgment

777
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,419
call at all but I think that's

778
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:51,250
unacceptable because there's just as

779
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:53,620
many women that have before that have

780
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:55,650
earned the right you know to be there

781
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:59,139
and they're not so that's that's

782
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:01,030
unacceptable and I think when you stop

783
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:04,230
accepting it and I know it's difficult

784
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:07,569
you know obviously it's a situation but

785
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:10,269
that is one step forward I think you say

786
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:12,740
it's not acceptable better

787
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:14,839
now one thing I've read in a lot of the

788
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,420
statistics is that women don't want to

789
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:19,970
be CEOs as they start climbing up the

790
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:23,480
ladder I mean it inhibits you and your

791
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:33,170
family life it means something to be a

792
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:35,089
CEO culture that makes it ok I think

793
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:37,820
that when we are in charge we're allowed

794
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:39,709
to set a culprit corporate culture that

795
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:42,500
allows it to be ok that I'm a single

796
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:45,079
mother so yes within my company we have

797
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,910
you know ability to have family time we

798
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:48,289
have work-life balance and those sort of

799
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:50,450
things I think that when you give us the

800
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:52,039
opportunity to be in those seats we want

801
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,319
to be there don't believe the hype that

802
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:57,619
we don't want to be in that seat I want

803
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:59,450
to be but do you think it is gonna give

804
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:03,219
us that opportunity they're gonna go

805
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:05,210
here have that opportunity we love you I

806
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,640
sold my house when I started the company

807
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,900
I'm like I'll be a CEO by myself until I

808
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,640
get the team behind me it took me a

809
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,349
while to be able to get there but I

810
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,940
raised every penny of that first seed

811
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:15,769
around in order for us to get us off the

812
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,630
ground and I continue to go out there

813
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:18,860
and pound out the payment doesn't make

814
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:21,050
it easy I'm raising a bridge around

815
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,990
right now but is it worth it every damn

816
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:25,550
day because I get to set these you know

817
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:27,109
these standards and I get to be the

818
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,789
company that I think should be there and

819
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:30,740
I get to show the imagery that is

820
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:32,119
diverse and shows fashion it shows

821
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:33,919
people of all walks of life using

822
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:36,920
cannabis in a way that I think is

823
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,840
responsible and medicinal and so that's

824
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,300
the powerful benefit of being there how

825
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,250
many people want to do that create

826
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:49,220
companies that have these kinds of power

827
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:50,690
of policy but I think we also have to I

828
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:52,759
don't want to be the most unlike person

829
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:55,159
on the panel but we have to make a point

830
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,920
to that women have had less time in

831
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,690
business and I mean I am a feminist to

832
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,980
the most I started my company while

833
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,440
living in a shelter there due to

834
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:05,840
domestic violence I know the sacrifice

835
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,360
and and what it takes to start from

836
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,220
nothing $15 and raising money and

837
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:14,570
selling part of my company to Aurora

838
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:16,699
which is male CEOs and they actually

839
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,350
what they did and this is why this is

840
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,909
why the men are in those positions right

841
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:22,039
now is because they recognize their

842
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:24,710
privilege and they

843
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:27,380
is that they had the power to invest in

844
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:30,199
a young female CEO and let her guide

845
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,480
where that money is going let her decide

846
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:35,539
how that billboards going to look and so

847
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,969
the fact that they came forward to that

848
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:40,369
point to do that I totally I embraced

849
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:42,769
that I will take those funds from the

850
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:44,509
male CEOs and position that properly so

851
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:47,750
that we can give more opportunity to

852
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:50,270
young and female CEOs moving forward but

853
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:52,789
that's not gonna happen overnight and so

854
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:54,440
it's going to take time and men have had

855
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:56,000
historically because they've been in the

856
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,980
workforce for so much longer

857
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,780
historically they do have more

858
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,639
experience in this space it doesn't make

859
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,440
that experience better it doesn't mean

860
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:05,779
that they're better at their job at all

861
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,849
but historically they have been in those

862
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,370
positions much longer and so if we can

863
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:11,900
utilize that power together I think

864
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:14,539
that's really how we get ahead because

865
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:17,450
most females don't have the capital

866
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:19,789
funding they got 2% of VC funding last

867
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:22,549
year alone I'm really really grateful

868
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:24,320
that I'm part of that 2% and so I want

869
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,780
to use that to be able to create

870
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,610
positions where more women can have

871
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:33,260
those tools and ability but it's not

872
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:34,610
gonna happen overnight I'm glad you

873
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,680
brought up that number because I think

874
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:38,450
that that's you know becomes the key is

875
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:41,089
why you see so many white male

876
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:42,769
businesses you know being able to

877
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,150
survive and thrive is because they're

878
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:46,039
getting that funding when women are

879
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,930
getting 2 percent of venture funding and

880
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,309
women of color are getting point 0 2

881
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:52,969
percent so we have to do five times

882
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:55,009
better to get to you I mean do you and I

883
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:56,659
order of that money and so they're

884
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,250
holding that money and we don't have the

885
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:59,989
access to and it allows us not to be

886
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,579
able to build those brands so I mean I

887
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:04,789
understand I closed around as well and

888
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:06,829
that doesn't happen as you know as often

889
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:09,590
but if you look at they think the normal

890
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:12,230
number for a white male CEO was to raise

891
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:14,570
3.6 million and there's only been 18

892
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,429
women of color who ever raised over a

893
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,630
million dollars so I think that you've

894
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:19,819
got to look at where that money is

895
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:25,400
coming from as where that power play is

896
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:27,260
as well and that's gonna change so I

897
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,050
asked the moderator I have to bring it

898
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,840
back to fashion because this is a huge

899
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:34,060
issue but you know is fashion the way we

900
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,090
can do it I mean as

901
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:39,489
that the are those in rows like women

902
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,470
have been enabled to have a historic

903
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:44,889
role say in marketing right they let us

904
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:46,899
be nurses they let us be secretaries and

905
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:49,480
then we became marketing people we've

906
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:53,050
made our inroads and now we've had

907
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:56,619
enough time that we have the economic

908
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:58,330
knowledge we have the money now greatest

909
00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:01,029
transfer of wealth in history to women

910
00:37:58,329 --> 00:38:04,630
that's happening right now and we have

911
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:06,970
the education right so we're there is

912
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:09,130
fashion like the Trojan horse can it get

913
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:12,730
us in fashion and beauty or does it have

914
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:15,250
a role to play here I think business is

915
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,469
business is business so whether it's

916
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:21,699
fashion or beauty or cannabis or

917
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:24,519
whatever it is it's business you all

918
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:26,019
agree okay do you agree well I think we

919
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:27,759
have to design our own lives you know

920
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:28,719
and we have the opportunity to do that

921
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,300
and we do that every day with our

922
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:33,849
choices so you end up with something you

923
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,800
say I didn't want this I don't like this

924
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:38,469
situation I'm in it's like but you made

925
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,730
decisions all along the way you know the

926
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:42,879
universe provides you with the things

927
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:46,000
that you say that you have so in in

928
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,789
terms of fashion I think that you learn

929
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,219
to you know project yourself in a way

930
00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:52,750
that you want to be seen so you have

931
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:54,549
choices you can buy this you can buy

932
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,980
that you know make your choices

933
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:59,440
carefully buy buy less and buy better is

934
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:06,400
my motto you know buy from people like

935
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:08,920
me for instance booth right there so you

936
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,130
know we have to decide that we want to

937
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:15,070
you know create more interest in what

938
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:16,869
we're doing by it does depend on how we

939
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:19,090
look you know how are you are you

940
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:21,219
presenting yourself how did we end up

941
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:23,079
looking today when we came to this panel

942
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:24,969
discussion we dressed in a certain way

943
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:27,460
because we decided we wanted to look

944
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:28,929
this way so you know those those are

945
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,110
choices you make every day and that's

946
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:33,519
what fashion does you make choices you

947
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:36,430
might try something new you might try

948
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:38,079
waist-high pants that's scary and then

949
00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:42,669
we're belt you know which I've done

950
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,329
recently it's wow that's crazy so I mean

951
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,610
the trends are the trends but you

952
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:48,860
can make them relate to your life by

953
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,450
trying them out doing the best you can

954
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,309
with it and having a good time with it

955
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:56,000
and it's like it should be something

956
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:57,829
somewhat fun so this leads beautifully

957
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,570
into my next question it's gonna be my

958
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:03,250
last one before I turn it over to you

959
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:03,250
okay good I'll keep mine

960
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:25,079
that actually having a brand for

961
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:27,710
bringing in the school the industry to

962
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,710
represent

963
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:45,220
even a game-high that we get

964
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:58,530
we're putting our team together

965
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:05,880
trying to figure out what type of intro

966
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:10,460
to use for a shirt

967
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:13,460
are we getting corporatecat or exercise

968
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,460
really

969
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:42,659
to make this and not like you know

970
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:42,660
showing booty legs like industry

971
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,590
what the heavy selling soda for the

972
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:50,670
women

973
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:55,880
so really cat-back we need more candles

974
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:55,880
those chairs as women because

975
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:32,219
I have one little thing to add to that

976
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,690
just have to consider your the brand you

977
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,980
know you are the brand how do you want

978
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:37,019
to look how do you want people to see

979
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,539
you and then you make choices

980
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:43,409
accordingly and so does your partner as

981
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:45,239
well I think an important point too is

982
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:46,829
knowing who you're marketing to I

983
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:48,659
yeah I want to talk about marketing

984
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:50,579
because like clearly that billboard that

985
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:54,089
we've addressed is not marketed towards

986
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:56,340
women but it's a huge billboard they had

987
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:58,920
the money for it and it's in their

988
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,510
interest to sell to men and that's where

989
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,059
when you're talking about having these

990
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:05,100
conversations I think it's really

991
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:08,159
important to talk about sex and talk

992
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:10,500
about how sex is utilized in marketing

993
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:15,059
so much and explaining why that's not

994
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:16,590
okay and I think that for me I I think

995
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:18,570
what we take from fashion and bring into

996
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:20,220
the space you know besides the idea of

997
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:22,289
you know not just plant we're talking

998
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:24,509
lifestyle we're talking broader context

999
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:27,300
across the board is really being able to

1000
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:29,370
target in on a demo as a business I know

1001
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,410
very clearly who an apothecary customer

1002
00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:33,839
is it's not just all women it's not just

1003
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:36,299
all men you know I'm looking at you know

1004
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:40,110
men and women who are medical users are

1005
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:43,500
urban professionals or females who are

1006
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:45,539
between 30 and 60 who are making $75,000

1007
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,489
a year more that's my target it's no

1008
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:48,779
longer you know I can just put out

1009
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:51,089
cannabis and people are just gonna run

1010
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,740
just cuz it's there so I think that in

1011
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:54,660
the same way that in fashion you know

1012
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:56,250
Forever 21's talking to somebody in H&amp;M

1013
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:58,469
talking to somebody

1014
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,940
you're starting to see that distinction

1015
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,889
within this space and I think that it's

1016
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,900
really parody what's happening in

1017
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:06,420
fashion well if you know who your

1018
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,030
customer is then your brand doesn't it's

1019
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:12,960
not about you it's about what you want

1020
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:14,880
to mean to your customer I think let's

1021
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,420
do some questions I've got more but you

1022
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,519
probably have better ones so I'm just a

1023
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:22,019
little curious because I think sexy like

1024
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:25,230
that was something that brought up a few

1025
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:27,719
times and I think sexy can be more of a

1026
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:30,269
state of being or an emotion that's

1027
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:31,649
invoked like I've seen your I've seen

1028
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:33,179
your products girl you you're killing it

1029
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:37,950
but it's something that's sexy it

1030
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:40,129
invokes something right right so how can

1031
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:43,230
you or how do you go about

1032
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:44,700
creating your personal brand as well as

1033
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,429
maybe you have something that you're

1034
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:48,809
actually selling clothing or whatever

1035
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:51,690
how do you do that without going too far

1036
00:44:48,809 --> 00:44:54,360
what what do you think is too far I also

1037
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:56,070
teach burlesque classes and I the

1038
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:59,640
brand's / my burlesque classes is called

1039
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:02,220
empowerment in heels and with that

1040
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:04,529
what's very interesting is I've found

1041
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:07,019
that a lot of my students have been more

1042
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:09,600
empowered by taking sexy photos of

1043
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:11,519
themselves and posting it on Instagram

1044
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,750
where once again it comes down to

1045
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:18,179
context they feel empowered by you know

1046
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:20,730
being a part of the burlesque show cases

1047
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:21,179
I provide to my students that's not for

1048
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,619
everyone

1049
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:25,949
not everyone wants to get up on stage

1050
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:26,880
and you know put that much sexiness out

1051
00:45:25,949 --> 00:45:31,500
there but that's what's so interesting

1052
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,150
about burlesque is really you can't go

1053
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,250
too far with it because it's based on

1054
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:39,090
your own comfort and watching a

1055
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:40,260
performer embrace that and really

1056
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:43,860
channel that through their performance

1057
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:46,080
based on their own comfort ability is

1058
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,360
amazing to see so I think with each

1059
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,429
person it's different I think we

1060
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:53,070
shouldn't criticize each other for

1061
00:45:50,429 --> 00:45:55,169
posting a sexy selfie or that sort of

1062
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:57,300
thing especially when you're

1063
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:59,880
incorporating that within your brand as

1064
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,340
long as it's a reflection of yourself

1065
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,800
and you're embracing it it won't

1066
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,870
in my opinion come off the same way as

1067
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,460
you know when they're probably deciding

1068
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:09,809
this idea for the Billboard all right

1069
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,889
what are we gonna do alright we'll get

1070
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,809
the okay yeah

1071
00:46:10,889 --> 00:46:15,839
all right let's I've been in front of

1072
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:18,150
plenty of photographers I've done plenty

1073
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,100
of shows with producers that have made

1074
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,809
me feel uncomfortable and that's a big

1075
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:25,409
reason why I decided to start producing

1076
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:27,059
my own show I'm not a female CEO but the

1077
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:32,099
nightlife industry in LA is

1078
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:34,289
predominantly male and so to produce my

1079
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:36,239
own show to make sure all my performers

1080
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:39,509
are performing in the safe environment

1081
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:42,629
is really fantastic and yeah it's sexy

1082
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:44,790
as hell but we're embracing it you know

1083
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:47,670
so I think as long as it's organic to

1084
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:50,009
you and you're not doing it for likes or

1085
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:51,150
just to sell your products like the

1086
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:53,280
billboard

1087
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:57,630
and you can't go too far as long as it's

1088
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:59,730
like organic and real I think it also

1089
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:02,579
goes back to um who your target audience

1090
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:04,050
is so it depends who and why you're

1091
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:05,849
building that brands the biggest point

1092
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:08,220
being why you're building that brand and

1093
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:10,920
who who you want to address within that

1094
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:13,139
and what your mission is is and like

1095
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,809
where is that line of sexy to achieve

1096
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:17,159
your mission in an authentic way yeah I

1097
00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:20,130
think that that's a really important

1098
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:23,429
thing to consider and I would say to

1099
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:25,860
along with your audience is who you are

1100
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:28,409
right you what and and that's true about

1101
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:30,690
all brands they're sort of entities unto

1102
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:33,389
themselves but it all starts with what

1103
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:36,329
you care about what your values are and

1104
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:40,920
then how they're going to relate to the

1105
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:44,309
external world so start here first it's

1106
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,500
a question that I'm asked a lot and have

1107
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:48,750
been recently so I'm very interested to

1108
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:52,500
sort of get all of your take on it but

1109
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:56,130
is back to the percentage I think it's

1110
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:58,079
thirty six percent of executives female

1111
00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:01,769
executives within this industry and I

1112
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,569
wanted to know why each of you thought

1113
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:05,429
that that is the case obviously we know

1114
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:06,870
this is a new industry and more

1115
00:48:05,429 --> 00:48:08,099
inclusive but I wanted to because I

1116
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:09,960
think you all come from such individual

1117
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:12,089
places that it'd be interesting to to

1118
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,280
ask why you think this is the case and

1119
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:17,820
let's just say that number has gone down

1120
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,650
to 27 percent right now personally I

1121
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,000
think there's a couple of things in play

1122
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,530
there I think that in the cannabis space

1123
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,000
right now there's a lower barrier to

1124
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:28,769
entry you know everyone knows the

1125
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,659
difficulty was regulation and license

1126
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:33,000
and all those things but on my side as

1127
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:34,469
an ancillary business there's a lower

1128
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,719
barrier to entry there's not a lot of

1129
00:48:34,469 --> 00:48:39,000
older legacy but companies that have

1130
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:41,449
been around so there was more open space

1131
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,730
for me to be able to build a brand there

1132
00:48:41,449 --> 00:48:47,129
and so that was very beneficial and and

1133
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:48,750
helped me want to get into the space I

1134
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:52,200
think that because you know the the

1135
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:56,190
industry and some ways is new there is a

1136
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:57,929
lot more opportunity for females to jump

1137
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,970
in and start their own companies in the

1138
00:48:57,929 --> 00:49:01,849
space but I think that if you look at

1139
00:48:59,969 --> 00:49:03,889
the numbers it also says that

1140
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:06,019
you know a lot more of the females are

1141
00:49:03,889 --> 00:49:08,059
on the side that don't need regulation

1142
00:49:06,019 --> 00:49:10,219
so we're doing consulting we're doing

1143
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:12,799
ancillary side businesses we're not as

1144
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:15,049
much on the on the plant side or on the

1145
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,210
dispensary owners side which is why I

1146
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:20,900
think that those numbers can be

1147
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:22,340
misleading at some times I really agree

1148
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,079
with that I think that the numbers are

1149
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:27,579
misleading in a lot of ways I know in

1150
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:30,829
Canada and for example there's one

1151
00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:34,279
publicly traded LP founded by a woman

1152
00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:36,799
that's it and I think that the number is

1153
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,390
decreasing quickly ten percent that's a

1154
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,850
huge decrease and I think that that's

1155
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:42,710
happening because we're separating

1156
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:44,150
ourselves in some capacities I don't

1157
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:46,699
mean we as in women I just mean in

1158
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:48,170
society we all of us men and women are

1159
00:49:46,699 --> 00:49:50,539
separating ourselves and not working

1160
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:52,820
towards the same common goal and also

1161
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:54,949
women in these positions we do

1162
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:57,170
experience a lot more challenges than

1163
00:49:54,949 --> 00:50:01,309
say a man would because it is a boys

1164
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:02,720
club and so often and when you come up

1165
00:50:01,309 --> 00:50:06,469
against those challenges you make a

1166
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:08,389
choice you either exit or you continue

1167
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:10,309
moving forward and you figure out how

1168
00:50:08,389 --> 00:50:12,319
you're gonna move forward and sometimes

1169
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:14,690
you have to sacrifice and in fact not

1170
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,670
sometimes you do have to sacrifice more

1171
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:19,250
than your male counterparts and that's

1172
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:21,470
challenging and it actually also and

1173
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:24,769
there's a statistic that showed that men

1174
00:50:21,469 --> 00:50:27,230
are based on their potential and women

1175
00:50:24,769 --> 00:50:31,239
are based on their performance so you

1176
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:33,559
have to continuously day in and day out

1177
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:36,079
outperform your male counterpart and

1178
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:37,820
that's tough as shit in this industry

1179
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,579
right now because this industry is

1180
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:43,130
moving so quickly it has so much capital

1181
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:47,059
behind it and so to be able to compete

1182
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:49,490
under those conditions are difficult and

1183
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:51,440
so I you know if of course some people

1184
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:54,349
are not going to want to keep up with

1185
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,510
that rap race and there's no no harm in

1186
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:58,849
that at all and but I think that it's

1187
00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:00,590
going to get to a space where women do

1188
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:02,059
have more of that funding that we're

1189
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,880
going to be able to see more women in

1190
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:07,130
that seat and we're not we this is not a

1191
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,900
great thing I think that it's and like

1192
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,820
I'm not for this it's just something

1193
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,860
that I'm observing that a lot of that

1194
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,660
funding is going to come from men

1195
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,500
because they're currently holding those

1196
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:17,659
funding because

1197
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:20,409
and so until we start working together

1198
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:23,929
and start dispersing those funds into

1199
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:25,460
more female CEO hands we're not going to

1200
00:51:23,929 --> 00:51:28,190
see that change happen and that's going

1201
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,889
to take some time and but but it's going

1202
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:33,170
to happen and I'd like to add just one

1203
00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:35,719
thing I alluded to before which I think

1204
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:39,230
this is a super historic moment in time

1205
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:41,868
never has there been such a new industry

1206
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:44,780
with the potential of this industry that

1207
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:49,280
is come along when women are super

1208
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:51,710
educated have the business acumen of a

1209
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:54,500
couple of generations now and have the

1210
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:57,920
financial wherewithal to participate so

1211
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:59,570
if we can marshal all of those resources

1212
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,740
and take advantage of this right now

1213
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:05,450
think it's a huge opportunity hello

1214
00:52:03,739 --> 00:52:06,679
thank you for this panel I think this is

1215
00:52:05,449 --> 00:52:09,649
great for all of us to hear especially

1216
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:11,329
as a man who works in female centric

1217
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:14,180
industries I own a birth center and work

1218
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:16,929
a lot with midwives so I came into Los

1219
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:19,219
Angeles making sure that my entire staff

1220
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:22,309
management wise was all female because

1221
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:24,588
I'm not trying to attract men with girls

1222
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:27,320
and booty shorts but we're also trying

1223
00:52:24,588 --> 00:52:29,449
to try trying to educate men on how to

1224
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:32,630
transition their business from a

1225
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:34,039
male-dominated one to a female centric

1226
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,450
one whether you're just trying to

1227
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:37,909
attract that marketers trying to have a

1228
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:40,608
more balanced so I'd like to hear how

1229
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:42,769
can males from this kind of standpoint

1230
00:52:40,608 --> 00:52:45,170
and in a male centric how can they

1231
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:47,300
transition better into having female

1232
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:49,400
centric kind of demographics being

1233
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,710
attract and not look disingenuous by

1234
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,900
having I mean I allow my staff to dress

1235
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:56,119
any way they want some of them dress you

1236
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,920
know in a in a way that may that might

1237
00:52:56,119 --> 00:53:00,260
reflect on me negatively saying that I'm

1238
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,490
telling them to dress this way even

1239
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,260
though that's the way they want to be

1240
00:53:01,489 --> 00:53:04,489
and I'm trying to allow them to express

1241
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,560
themselves in the way they want to

1242
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:08,659
collect tips in the way that they want

1243
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,190
to attract business in the way they want

1244
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:12,469
to and also come from a place of

1245
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,510
Education but we're talking about it

1246
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:17,539
being a male centric so how do males

1247
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:20,150
transition better and really empower if

1248
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:22,250
they have that ability to empower anyone

1249
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:23,430
to come up into this and show a better

1250
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:25,650
kind of

1251
00:53:23,429 --> 00:53:27,269
a better marketing tool that isn't just

1252
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:29,849
looked at as disingenuous to say it's

1253
00:53:27,269 --> 00:53:33,030
just about sex I think it's about being

1254
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:36,390
true to your brand and to yourself and

1255
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:39,690
to your vision and then inspiring your

1256
00:53:36,389 --> 00:53:42,739
people to join you on that journey and

1257
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:45,539
defining what it is that's my thought I

1258
00:53:42,739 --> 00:53:47,759
would you came back up okay go on I

1259
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:50,969
would say you know to make sure that

1260
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,890
your you said that your staff is mostly

1261
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:54,509
female but as you're talking about the

1262
00:53:52,889 --> 00:53:56,098
advertising play that you're going out

1263
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,300
and when you're doing your pamphlets and

1264
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:59,460
leaflets and everything that's going to

1265
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:02,160
touch that public facing that you have

1266
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:04,108
women sitting at the table with you on

1267
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:06,299
on those things being able to have those

1268
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:09,750
conversations because there's some

1269
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:12,420
things that are that you'll read that

1270
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,949
are different than how I'll read it how

1271
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,010
I read it has a mother how I read it as

1272
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:18,179
a woman and you do I completely agree

1273
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:20,460
that you want to avoid the idea of

1274
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:22,409
tokenism or you know throwing those

1275
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:26,699
little bits out without having a full

1276
00:54:22,409 --> 00:54:28,440
well-rounded idea of being a female

1277
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:32,399
focused business so I would just say

1278
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,990
make as many females welcome at that

1279
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,470
table and listen to them when they talk

1280
00:54:33,989 --> 00:54:39,479
that's the key yeah and I think it's an

1281
00:54:37,469 --> 00:54:42,358
important to mention that not all women

1282
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,429
have the same perspective um and have

1283
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:45,869
the same perspective and like let's not

1284
00:54:44,429 --> 00:54:46,949
divide ourselves further like what you

1285
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:49,829
were saying like it's really

1286
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:52,199
conversation to conversation like don't

1287
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:55,410
be afraid to ask questions I find so

1288
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:57,629
many people fearful of asking me about

1289
00:54:55,409 --> 00:55:01,078
Birla's because they're ignorant to it

1290
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:03,000
and they're like shy about it and so

1291
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:04,769
with anything like I feel like as long

1292
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,039
as you have a conversation with open

1293
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:12,000
ears and dialogue about it it will only

1294
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:15,659
benefit in general when I came to Los

1295
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,358
Angeles my patient base was 19% female

1296
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:21,409
we're currently at 63% which i think is

1297
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:23,789
a completely different switch than most

1298
00:55:21,409 --> 00:55:26,219
dispensaries not only in California but

1299
00:55:23,789 --> 00:55:28,019
in the nation because I was a track I

1300
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:29,939
was trying to attract that demographic

1301
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:31,409
cuz I felt they were underserved feel

1302
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,210
like there wasn't a safe place for them

1303
00:55:31,409 --> 00:55:34,219
to go to feel like their needs were

1304
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:36,260
being met

1305
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:38,239
and so because I come from another

1306
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:40,280
industry that is so female-centric it

1307
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,348
was like well I really wanted to embody

1308
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,690
as much of that as possible but as you

1309
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:46,760
try to go outward of just my four little

1310
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:48,920
walls and try to give like you know I

1311
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,390
they do all the marketing I mean my

1312
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,460
management staff does all the marketing

1313
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:54,500
they do all the graphic design stuff we

1314
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:56,300
decide as a group but it's mostly like

1315
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,460
they have as much veto power as I do

1316
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:00,230
over what we have for marketing you can

1317
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:02,780
tell that they've pushed more towards a

1318
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:04,400
medical model now that isn't necessarily

1319
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:07,460
attracting this kind of newer

1320
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,139
recreational user it seems like its

1321
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,670
attracting kind of an older demographic

1322
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:12,799
because that's where they think it's the

1323
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:15,200
most respectable way to come from a

1324
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,940
female to say this is what they want but

1325
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:19,879
we're also trying to bridge past this

1326
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:21,800
okay females aren't just about just

1327
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,450
about fashion they have needs of

1328
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,920
Education they have needs of kind of

1329
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:27,559
like so there's all these diverse needs

1330
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:30,170
and even trying to get the females

1331
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:32,389
inside of my own business to say well

1332
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:34,490
sometimes we do need to attract the

1333
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:36,589
fashion side of things sometimes we need

1334
00:56:34,489 --> 00:56:38,689
to draw outside of just this medical

1335
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:41,088
model so that we don't look disingenuous

1336
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:42,320
as a female run business so that's kind

1337
00:56:41,088 --> 00:56:45,289
of the balance I was trying to create

1338
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:47,539
all right so we're just at a time so

1339
00:56:45,289 --> 00:56:49,130
what we're gonna do is the panelists

1340
00:56:47,539 --> 00:56:51,829
we're gonna first we're gonna ask you to

1341
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:54,079
go onto the brittania deck after this so

1342
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:57,139
if you have more questions for specific

1343
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,848
people they'll be out there I want to

1344
