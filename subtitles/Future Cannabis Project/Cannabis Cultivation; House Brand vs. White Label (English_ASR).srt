[Music]

2
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:17,509
you have enough to put out there on the

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,460
market yeah for sure and you're out

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,000
there shopping these guys getting them

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,410
and pick it up so how much do you do as

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,099
original brand to your own versus a

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,509
white label for laughing yeah well

8
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:32,329
that's a moving target as well you know

9
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:34,759
because just coming into the compliance

10
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:36,469
legal market and form a distribution

11
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:40,218
we're still kind of getting our feet wet

12
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:42,170
so as we're opening new accounts still

13
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:45,289
small business cash flows King

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,210
so I'm outsourcing and just bulking out

15
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:48,800
and white label and selling to

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,500
manufacturers as much as I can right now

17
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,259
to keep cash flow going and to still

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,329
open doors on stores and I'd say we

19
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:57,679
probably have a pretty extensive menu

20
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,620
compared to other brands on the market

21
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:05,390
and we have over 60 SKUs Co a shelf

22
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:08,329
ready and that's still probably again

23
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,849
probably bout 25% of my production yeah

24
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:11,810
so hopefully that will change and as we

25
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:14,390
get more market share

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,609
I will provide less material or

27
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,200
specialized on material because it's

28
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:20,090
great to have good relationships it's

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,879
great to thrive with a thriving brand

30
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,380
and so I'm happy to work with you know

31
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,048
people like poplin Barclays and be one

32
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:28,670
of their tried-and-true farmers and that

33
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:30,770
helps build my brand as well because

34
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,259
they have a good brand equity so we help

35
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:35,000
build each other up and I think there

36
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,680
will always be a balance where I won't

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,560
always just be like oh I'm gonna build

38
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,549
my brand in ya know find a new supplier

39
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,740
I always want to keep those

40
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:44,659
relationships and have a good place in

41
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:47,000
the brand for me and I'd also like to

42
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:50,780
look at limited release you know I mean

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,299
this is a seasonal product you know I'm

44
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,920
not I'm just trying to be something

45
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:56,479
that's on the Shelf with the same exact

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,100
product year round it's like get it

47
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,718
while it's hot there's something there

48
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:01,908
there's a hey there's a formula there

49
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:03,408
when you make a drop people know it's

50
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:04,909
coming and they're like oh it's not

51
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:06,618
gonna be around next month so I better

52
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,000
get all I can and we're seeing that in

53
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:09,080
other industries right it's funny you

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,550
point that out because the clothing

55
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,650
industry has moved towards that like

56
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,319
just limit it no matter if it's kicks

57
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,670
acres or if it's clothing lines and it's

58
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:18,530
interesting you point that after be area

59
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,780
yeah craft beers the same way and I'm

60
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,870
like it I'm mice self-proclaimed canis

61
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:26,000
or so every time a season ends I

62
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,769
actually pull out last year's crop like

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,180
I just from hidden Prairie farm I just

64
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:32,450
took out summer blue skittles which he

65
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,519
knows a bit trendy but there was

66
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:36,018
something about her blue skittles and

67
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:37,129
it's just like I bust that out this

68
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:39,438
season and was able to obviously

69
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:41,030
preserve it thanks to the seal on mason

70
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:43,699
jars and what we put our product that we

71
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,318
put out but there are enough canisters

72
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:47,298
to your point there like that is coveted

73
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:48,888
like that's that was the strain that

74
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:50,420
worked for me that worked for my

75
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:52,849
endocannabinoid system I don't know

76
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:54,289
about how I reacted to yours so I agree

77
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:55,608
with you I could see people like this is

78
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:57,259
a limited edition I got to pick it up

79
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:59,030
and I'm all about I mean I love

80
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:01,608
supporting the farmer but yeah I'll pay

81
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,438
20 30 40 percent more over what a

82
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:05,930
typical lathe goes for typical ounce

83
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:12,048
goes for if it means getting quality

84
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:14,510
fire you know just like that bottle of

85
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:17,209
wine from 2003 it's the same thing yeah

86
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:18,698
so very cool so yeah and that's another

87
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,019
part of my strategy is trying to get

88
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:23,329
ahead on the strain releases and

89
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:25,400
hopefully we'll have a hot new strain

90
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,680
and that season before everybody has it

91
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,629
and then get that out and go that was

92
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,079
that we're on to the next one you got to

93
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:35,918
get it while it's here so hopefully well

94
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,919
it'll all work out in that way

95
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:45,740
