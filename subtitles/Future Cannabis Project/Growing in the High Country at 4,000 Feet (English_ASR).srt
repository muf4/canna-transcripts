1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,230
I would like to do clothing like like

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:18,089
work wear clothing a car hard like real

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:20,579
because the hemp is really good as far

4
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:22,740
as it lasts that's why Levi used to

5
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,389
build their Levi's out of hemp and then

6
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,579
they drive cotton because the cotton

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,980
wears out right and you can buy early

8
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,849
Tesla is using hemp in what it seats

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:36,000
your sita is it gonna imagine most sales

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:38,760
make anything so I'm gonna I'm gonna

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,039
this year I'm doing the hemp and I got

12
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,530
I'm gonna do 8 acres and I'm gonna do it

13
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,390
orchard style I'm gonna you know rather

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,280
than a lot of people are just you know

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,920
doing it you know as much as they can

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,329
fit on one acre I'm gonna try and grow

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,219
trees quality and then just process that

18
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,780
whole plant from stock you know

19
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,879
basically from route up and eight acres

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,939
like is that comparatively that's a good

21
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,649
amount yeah I mean it's a big fir for

22
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:10,048
right now if I go too big I don't have

23
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,118
the budget right and if I fail would

24
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,210
this be your so this would be your first

25
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:18,000
so be my first well no I grew some hemp

26
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:21,118
last year so just quickly what area are

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,969
you like what's the Appalachian you want

28
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,228
to end into a longer but give me

29
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:29,009
something more people like River

30
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:30,658
represents Temecula Temecula they say in

31
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,009
Riverside County because everybody's

32
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,020
like ants I know ah but this is housing

33
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,989
here Doug yeah it's a stigma to a

34
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,989
Riverside County Anne's Appalachia

35
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:52,949
Association Humboldt yeah weird outdoor

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,899
Nixon I get but you're humble or high

37
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,359
country what's it worth what's there

38
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:04,978
there's is Humboldt County Growers

39
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:09,118
Association yeah yeah there's a southern

40
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:11,430
and there's a northern HCG oh but why I

41
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,049
mean not that it's not legitimate what

42
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,819
high country

43
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:17,230
yeah and that's one of that regions kind

44
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:19,539
of high country like anything that's

45
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:21,218
coming in like the 408 so that has a

46
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:23,289
meaning people you know with it we you

47
00:02:21,218 --> 00:02:25,930
know I grow in the high country people

48
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:28,030
they know it yeah okay well then that

49
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,739
would be a legitimate part of your Apple

50
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,049
especially if you're out in that area

51
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:33,968
like all the like the 4-h club for

52
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:36,310
instance is high country 4-h the

53
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:38,438
newspaper's high country Journal okay

54
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,509
and everything's kind of this okay they

55
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:42,068
wanted to do some of the other guys were

56
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:43,539
like nah let's do high desert and I'm

57
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:45,399
like it's not really well not really

58
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:47,739
high desert right you know right and

59
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,019
that's specific you don't you wanted

60
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,180
your name to represent and it's

61
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,109
important where you're from right hmm

62
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,260
that's the whole point

63
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:58,950
yeah totally yeah that's a big part is

64
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:02,378
oh yeah this is so crazy to me because

65
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:04,839
only California like but tell afford not

66
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:07,810
only but most of all has all of these

67
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,419
local associations and in the scheme of

68
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,060
things you figure that's not gonna last

69
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:16,419
because you know as the industry matures

70
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,389
there should not be the need for so many

71
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:22,209
so many and then we'd amount God or they

72
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:24,639
really combined or they combined exactly

73
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,919
yeah but for the moment cuz I was

74
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,139
surprised because I've been covering the

75
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,939
industry for like five six years and and

76
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:32,949
I've talked to lots of people in

77
00:03:30,938 --> 00:03:37,049
different associations especially around

78
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:38,709
California goes yeah hi hi hi country

79
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,310
Growers Association

80
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:44,769
I mean every room you know I go was

81
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,810
pretty new too so that was the

82
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:50,289
interesting point to me that even now

83
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,900
kind of like after you know a little bit

84
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:53,858
of time there's still a need to create a

85
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,658
new Association

86
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:58,659
oh yeah cuz there there's a Cannella

87
00:03:55,658 --> 00:04:01,500
Valley Association Growers Association

88
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:04,269
or can't they could selling cannabis

89
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,389
associations right but they're all about

90
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:09,549
indoor well no and it's still growers

91
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:11,500
and often these associations for these

92
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,579
areas will represent not just growers

93
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,930
but the ancillary industries as well

94
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:18,788
manufacturers that's what these guys do

95
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,590
they're more retail manufacturers

96
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:21,668
distributors because they're down in

97
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,319
Coachella Valley and they're working

98
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:25,599
with all those different entities

99
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:29,829
they're so they're like all you know we

100
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,260
need to get him we kind of put heads

101
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:35,319
with them because he doesn't like us

102
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:37,569
because were the black market guys right

103
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:40,269
you know and we're the dudes that like

104
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,980
right but you wouldn't start an

105
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:45,759
association if you were kind of weren't

106
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,500
interested in going legal no that's the

107
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,719
whole reason we started it was because

108
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,370
we were getting screwed and reg reg you

109
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,050
know regulation and we're like we gotta

110
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,850
come you know we got to get like-minded

111
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,770
guys cuz up there nobody really wants to

112
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,379
expose themselves right you know there's

113
00:04:56,769 --> 00:05:01,629
20 million plus people out right around

114
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:03,670
us so there's no real reason to come out

115
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:06,069
and say hey look at me right

116
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,230
you know I grow I want to make a brand

117
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:14,019
everybody's happy because really the

118
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:16,390
reality is is people are showing up this

119
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:21,699
that and it's easy because they can fly

120

into la San Diego boom they're out there

121

I think he's actually he's got a chance

157
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:24,388
it's not that many people vote do them

158
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:26,280
no and and when when you take areas like

159
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:28,408
that to where their rural areas and it's

160
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,209
hard to get the word out there and you

161
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:31,860
know a lot of people don't really care -

162
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:33,508
like I said a lot of those people you

163
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,770
know they mind their own business right

164
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:38,370
you know they take care of themselves

165
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:40,109
they might not even vote but they might

166
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,699
vote if it's someone who will like go

167
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,348
look I understand I'm one of you I'll

168
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:46,620
leave you alone that's where I was like

169
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:48,269
I'm not a voter like I'm gonna I don't

170
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,519
believe in that it's I don't believe in

171
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:52,848
a two-party system it divides us you

172
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,139
know and so buddy's like now you got it

173
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:57,750
how about I donate a little bit of money

174
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,340
and I pump me you know I put your name

175
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,500
out there and help you out a little bit

176
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:06,060
but they're cool he's a cool family

177
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:10,348
they're uh they're from Mexico

178
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:13,439
Ensenada explain that Sidewalk the canna

179
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:14,968
gar yeah I was gonna get into making

180
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,699
these and I was like fuck that's a lot

181
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:19,889
of work to do it I'm into do them

182
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,629
handcrafted you know and hand-rolled

183
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:33,899
like you got they got these presses you

184
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:35,940
can stick them in no no I mean that one

185
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,620
time I did now I'm you know if I want to

186
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,630
smoke something's gonna be cannabis yeah

187
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,000
I would say I mean I don't see anything

188
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:42,659
just the other day a guy up here was

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,559
rolling in

190
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:50,909
but he didn't say he was rolling uh yeah

191
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:52,859
I mean I took a hit and I'm like oh good

192
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:54,689
tobacco and now yes it's kind of for me

193
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,529
it's like you're ruining it he's like

194
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:01,080
yeah yeah some people love it

195
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:06,689
that's cool for 17 years in st. Croix

196
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:12,620
and the local font and yeah I mean

197
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:14,820
obviously a boy let me drink you know

198
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,799
because obviously in Amsterdam the

199
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,050
locals do that too they mix them and

200
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,279
they always have and they go oh so cuz I

201
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:22,620
don't want to get that like but it's

202
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:26,399
like it actually adds something I'm like

203
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:29,639
no you know just cannabis alone it's not

204
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,159
that it's it's not that it adds with

205
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:34,439
what cannabis does is the answer the

206
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,120
tobacco is no I know but they think it's

207
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,860
adding something to it what it is is

208
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,379
cannabis isn't an enhancer and so

209
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,970
whatever that terpene or you know

210
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,580
flavonoid whatever's in the tobacco

211
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,889
that's giving you that high the cannabis

212
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,030
is kicking it up and so you're getting

213
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:50,970
the boats that's why they're saying yeah

214
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:53,850
we need this for the opioids because you

215
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,830
can do a little bit of cannabis and half

216
00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:18,000
the opioids you were doing before and

217
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:22,020
it's gonna be huh Jesse so why don't you

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,110
introduce us to your appellation of

219
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,149
origin and talk about what you're

220
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,800
growing there

221
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:33,449
alright the appellation of origin that

222
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:37,559
that I would like to see happen one day

223
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:43,340
is out in Riverside County out in the

224
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:48,739
Anza Valley it sits at about 4,000 feet

225
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:50,639
3,800 to 4,000 it's it's one of the

226
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,789
personally I think it's one of the best

227
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,740
places in North America because of the

228
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:58,610
micro climates

229
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,680
the dry the the way the Sun hits this

230
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:05,289
particular region it sits on the 33rd

231
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:09,079
parallel so it it duplicates the same as

232
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:11,899
a lot of these strains that come from

233
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:19,129
Morocco or Lebanon that sit in these

234
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:21,019
same regions so it's it's it it's one of

235
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:24,860
those spots that you really got it you

236
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:29,000
know it's it's small it's only 16 miles

237
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,990
by 8 miles a 60 miles long by 8 miles

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,519
wide so it's a small little region and

239
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:37,039
and cannabis has been grown there for a

240
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,789
while yeah yeah I know people have been

241
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:44,419
growing up there since the early 70s so

242
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:46,579
because that's an important element of

243
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:50,799
the creating an appellation that you can

244
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:55,370
also show you know a history of sort of

245
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:59,708
use you know and for a particular crop

246
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:04,370
for growing in the genetics then also

247
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:06,289
show there's a plant doesn't know

248
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,919
whether it's legal or not illegal you

249
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:11,990
know so the plant history is still there

250
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,370
and that's really know definitely we're

251
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,720
looking at appellation that's all

252
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,149
they're gonna need to care about

253
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,778
yeah the science as far as the genetics

254
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:23,419
and the the plant morphing back into her

255
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:25,009
you know space and knowing that oh this

256
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:27,289
is where I'm supposed to be and this is

257
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,860
where I thrive you know it's not too

258
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,929
humid

259
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,089
it's the perfect dry it's the perfect

260
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:34,729
altitude it's the perfect where the Sun

261
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:37,040
hits the plant and all these things come

262
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,200
into play there the particular strains

263
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:44,208
are in genetics very well there yeah all

264
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:46,278
the the the Afghan or endo cush strains

265
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:51,769
all those into cush strains anything

266
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:54,789
that that came from the Hindu Kush

267
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:57,828
mountain range or Afghan mountain range

268
00:12:54,789 --> 00:13:02,110
would do well in this energy because all

269
00:12:57,828 --> 00:13:03,609
your genes exactly

270
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,470
y-you know like that's how they got sent

271
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,970
on my nap when I say parallels burgundy

272
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,250
and Bordeaux and stuff and everything

273
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,959
you say just translate you right across

274
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:14,019
yeah once you start connecting that and

275
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,458
really doing the research into yeah it's

276
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:17,379
still farming but once you start

277
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:19,778
connecting those parallels and realize

278
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:22,208
oh this is why this works so good in

279
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:24,309
this region then it clicks and it's eat

280
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,958
it's easy to place that cultivar where

281
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:28,149
it needs to be and you're not you know

282
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,809
growing some sativa up there and going

283
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:30,940
wall

284
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,528
yeah it's getting huge because it's

285
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,350
getting the Sun and she's getting what

286
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:37,629
she likes but it's not producing what

287
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,820
you're looking for you know and I've

288
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:42,578
learned up there that you can mix these

289
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,709
two Tevas into some of these heavy into

290
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:48,099
cos and come up with plants that are

291
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:50,708
yielding eight pounds really simple yeah

292
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,740
do you guys have a voice at the groups

293
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:57,549
that are working on this a california

294
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:01,450
appalachian CCIA has a group you know

295
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:02,919
you gotta get in there not yet working

296
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,019
towards that it's you know like I said

297
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:07,208
it's a small region and it's taken time

298
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:09,600
to get like-minded people together and

299
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:12,549
that would increase the value if a

300
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,850
valley like that we're you know the

301
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:19,528
environment is like really conducive

302
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:22,629
mm-hmm that's why that's key is to get

303
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:24,730
well and that's the other problem is

304
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:26,289
that true it's all unincorporated it's

305
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,810
all incorporated and that's the other

306
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:30,939
problem is the the license process has

307
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:33,849
gone to where they want things to go

308
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:39,699
indoors and and to have an Appalachian

309
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:45,040
we need to have the Sun that's the huge

310
00:14:39,698 --> 00:14:47,919
problem that now the soil or wine no

311
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,659
yeah right well which which I was gonna

312
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,819
ask about because you know even up in

313
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:53,919
Humboldt in in up in the Emerald

314
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,690
triangle like they grew in pots up there

315
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,729
love but they still want the Appalachian

316
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:00,449
shit in Appalachian only apply to in

317
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:03,220
ground it smells great doesn't it I

318
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:07,328
personally for me I'm finding that the

319
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:09,459
native soil up there is fired I mean

320
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:11,979
this stuff you cannot make it up

321
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:14,528
yeah so it's up in the fort like what

322
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,909
kind of is it like no it's more of a

323
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:18,759
mineralized you

324
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:22,419
we're in a you know highly mineralized

325
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:25,629
rather than forest and so what I'm

326
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:32,319
finding his body by having soil that's

327
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:35,289
neutral high in mineral it's a lot

328
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,970
easier to to manipulate the plant when

329
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:39,399
she's in flower and he said it's

330
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,500
fungally dominant right no no i'm

331
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,419
finding that that you know when we were

332
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,399
pressing some of our material like i was

333
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:47,649
talking to the guys from sasquatch we

334
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,600
were talking and they were saying a lot

335
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:54,340
of the stuff that they're pressing from

336
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:58,269
up north has that fungal flavor in it

337
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:00,040
because of of you know there's so much

338
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:02,740
plant matter up there that's breaking

339
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:08,829
down in the soil and there's so much fun

340
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:10,930
fungus and plum you know the words that

341
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:13,540
breaks down and out plants sucking that

342
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:18,370
up into the flowers here it's a lot more

343
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:20,199
neutral to where it's you're able to

344
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,840
when it starts going into flower rather

345
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:26,200
than you know you're you're able to take

346
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:28,720
the plant and really manipulate the

347
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,330
flower process rather than some places

348
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,710
up north you get into where you're

349
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:38,560
you're stuck in that soil that's full of

350
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:39,910
broken-down fungi and the leaves and all

351
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,579
this stuff that that you don't

352
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:44,439
necessarily want the plant to uptake now

353
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,450
you're stuck with that in the flower and

354
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,530
then once you press it we're finding

355
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:52,540
that you know by pressing flower up

356
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:55,569
there and flower down here you're seeing

357
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:57,759
a huge difference in the turps

358
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,010
and the flavor and all that stuff you

359
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,169
know and i think a lot of it has to do

360
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:05,379
with the soil so you think you're

361
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:09,129
getting a pure expression of the

362
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:11,350
genetics down here yes with more of a

363
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:17,410
neutralized soil and more of a mineral

364
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:19,480
high mineral i'm mineral content so do

365
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:22,689
these minerals do they have any taste or

366
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,709
I mean do their well what they do is the

367
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:29,110
plant takes those minerals and makes

368
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,320
different terpenes and different you

369
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:30,699
know

370
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,220
all right so but that makes it just

371
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,410
unique to the area then yeah well that's

372
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,480
what makes the two are so important when

373
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,519
the soil comes into play because you

374
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,480
know you always tell flour from that

375
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:46,720
area yeah yeah there's a hue of the

376
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,819
smell yeah that's a smell and there's a

377
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,589
few little unique things that give it

378
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:58,529
away yeah if the outdoor stuffs got

379
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:58,529
these little flowers in it that blow

380
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:06,430
that blow off in the wind layers they're

381
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:08,980
Mountain layers

382
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,840
yeah it's a little cold all right so

383
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:15,610
actually start start from the top again

384
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:20,679
you're you're at 4,000 feet I'm at 38

385
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:26,309
but the valleys bout from 4,000 to 3,500

386
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:30,390
and it's you know it's got a very dry

387
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:33,849
climate to it there's certain micro

388
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:36,190
climates within the valley like my areas

389
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:37,899
a lot different than some of the areas

390
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:41,140
that are a little bit further east that

391
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,640
would be a little higher up which I get

392
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,250
kind of a little bit of a coastal Eddy

393
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,940
that comes in and kind of keeps it a

394
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:50,500
little bit warmer then some of the areas

395
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,340
that are higher up that don't get that

396
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,319
coastal Eddy

397
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,759
so I where do you get your because we

398
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:58,329
just came from this conference where do

399
00:18:54,759 --> 00:19:01,990
you get your energy and your water the

400
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:06,220
waters I sit on an aquifer so I'm on a

401
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:08,620
well so it's all groundwater is anyone

402
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,620
doing any dry farming I'm gonna try this

403
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:14,939
here if we get another you if we get

404
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:14,939
some good rain he'll turn

405
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:26,889
okay good topic what was the answer we

406
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:29,019
all I think and I think I can do it

407
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,240
because where my water table is I sit in

408
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:37,408
a little Valley with an aquifer well

409
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:40,269
that's why it has to be like that plan

410
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:42,250
totally at all and I think you can get

411
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:44,918
this if you do by seed you're gonna get

412
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,509
that tap root I personally think and you

413
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,419
know you can get a tap root to go at

414
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:52,148
least six if not deeper six feet eight

415
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:54,820
talk to some of the farmers who are

416
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:57,308
doing this up along the eel River

417
00:19:54,819 --> 00:20:00,548
mmm they have several years under their

418
00:19:57,308 --> 00:20:02,500
belt and though they'll share they'll

419
00:20:00,548 --> 00:20:05,679
share with you all day long I think if

420
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,778
you do you you start them and you starve

421
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:12,130
them what you do because I do grapes - I

422
00:20:07,778 --> 00:20:15,759
got grapes and Malbec Malbec petit petit

423
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:18,700
Sirah is what I got going right now

424
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:21,690
yeah the Malbec fire yeah same thing we

425
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,100
sit on the same parallel is that

426
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:28,390
Argentinian stuff I'm a big fan of all

427
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:34,329
that no it's just a hobby this is just a

428
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:36,250
hobby race but it's for pressing press

429
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:40,778
there wine grape yeah yeah I have some

430
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:45,599
table grapes some I'm playing with it

431
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:45,599
I'm playing with it I wouldn't you know

432
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:52,898
but it's it's a fun hobby you know it's

433
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,690
another it's another one of those

434
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:59,229
hobbies I enjoy when you grow things and

435
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:02,409
then you get to enjoy the harvest

436
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:04,659
I have eucalyptus the baby the sweet gum

437
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:06,370
eucalyptus the ones for the the forestry

438
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:09,700
arrangements are you finding that flavor

439
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:11,319
in your grapes I want to because I could

440
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,360
tell I have a terrible palette but

441
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:18,730
eucalyptus and green pepper I can tell

442
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:21,278
if there's a job well it's a great

443
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:24,669
recipe is very dominant Oh totally I've

444
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:27,429
dad the capsicum and um it's a great

445
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:34,809
pesticide though natural yeah

446
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:38,109
oh yeah no no because we're so so dry

447
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:41,288
that's why we do we can do the the oh

448
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:43,658
geez D I mean I'm pulling stuff in late

449
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:45,940
November you know when people are

450
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:47,109
panicking up north and September your

451
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,239
honor there comes the water you know

452
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:51,759
here comes the rain let's go you know

453
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:53,229
we're sitting back and just you know

454
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:57,069
it's it's definitely one of those spots

455
00:21:53,229 --> 00:22:00,489
where the future is going to be in these

456
00:21:57,069 --> 00:22:05,048
Appalachians and you know what cultivars

457
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:07,629
are coming out of them it's a it's a

458
00:22:05,048 --> 00:22:09,548
water it's a shelf it's a it's a

459
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:11,108
watershed basically oh yeah it's one of

460
00:22:09,548 --> 00:22:17,739
the most pristine water shelves in

461
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:20,378
Southern California oh yeah I mean the

462
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:25,119
good clean water is is key my water

463
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:41,189
comes out at six eight pH 7 7 oh I mean

464
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:41,189
that's perfect water down there sar DHA

465
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:47,408
you know but ya know that's the thing up

466
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:49,960
there is we got pristine water we got a

467
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:54,070
lot of it you know we sit on a water

468
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:57,159
shelf that feeds a big part of Southern

469
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:59,648
California you know and so that's that's

470
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:02,440
a big key for a lot of us is to be able

471
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:08,888
to have clean water and not have to

472
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:11,739
reverse osmosis so just quickly are

473
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:14,288
these different cultivars yes okay so

474
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:15,969
what are we what can we start with the

475
00:23:14,288 --> 00:23:23,469
category yeah that thing looks young

476
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:27,788
yeah yeah you need to be proud of that

477
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:30,999
so so III hand-make a bunch of them

478
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:33,398
every year when I harvest and so

479
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:36,190
interestingly I in my mind I thought you

480
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:39,638
would you'd cure the outer leaves first

481
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:41,380
but you actually wrap it fresh yeah then

482
00:23:39,638 --> 00:23:45,189
you cure the flowers cure

483
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:48,190
yeah and then I'll wrap it with leaf

484
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,029
that I pick and then let it cure after

485
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:53,230
the fact

486
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:57,190
those are candies yeah and then and then

487
00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:00,880
I'll use a little bit of rosin to

488
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:04,058
basically glue those on there in the

489
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,470
whole plant yeah it's the whole plant

490
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:07,149
there's even a little bit of Keef in

491
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:17,890
there to just kind of lined everything

492
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:20,320
together and kind of yeah yeah I mean

493
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:23,950
definitely I mean it's something that

494
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:26,200
men do for me it's it's a it's the aroma

495
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:34,419
it's not so much too high you know it's

496
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:39,308
more of just the aroma you will see in

497
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:41,679
one second so that's going to start

498
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:50,889
glowing in a second it'll be hot it'll

499
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:52,929
be very hot and so hot so you roll

500
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:55,179
because you got to do it kind of bet

501
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:57,220
harvest because you need you need those

502
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:59,740
fresh leaves so how many do you roll a

503
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:04,029
year and you give them in like a humidor

504
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:15,970
yeah like like a cigar yeah I'll do like

505
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:18,970
maybe a dozen yeah it's a craft thing

506
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:20,769
you know it's something yeah it's

507
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,500
something that you know there there's a

508
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:25,750
lot of guys that are making them some

509
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,308
guys are more into the craft part of it

510
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:34,140
and some guys just want to mass-produce

511
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:34,139
them how long to be what 15 20 minutes

512
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:39,700
depends sometimes I'll do them different

513
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:44,940
you know sometimes I'll put a lot more

514
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,940
keep you know keep on them each one's

515
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:52,090
yeah they take time definitely they take

516
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,930
few days - yeah definitely they take

517
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:57,769
some time

518
00:25:52,930 --> 00:26:00,849
- smokin is this thing ready Peter

519
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:00,848
[Music]

520
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:06,679
[Laughter]

521
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:24,040
what's the strain in there you know I

522
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:27,840
want to see the tangi girl which is a

523
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:27,839
tan G and Girl Scout cookie

524
00:26:34,148 --> 00:26:39,908
these are really really nice trips and

525
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:57,009
you wouldn't expect from such a really

526
00:26:39,909 --> 00:27:02,609
tight and this is rock-solid they're

527
00:26:57,009 --> 00:27:06,778
just a regular I try to over seven days

528
00:27:02,608 --> 00:27:14,608
dry and then the care process is can be

529
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:14,608
from three weeks to a month sometimes

530
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:36,189
some plant settle yield board five

531
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:38,259
pounds some that'll do you do you have

532
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:40,119
like different parcels where you're

533
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:42,399
doing different like some are bigger

534
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:43,658
plants and some you're going smaller so

535
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,768
I'm you're planting like well actually

536
00:27:43,659 --> 00:28:28,419
do you do everything from seed Dan yeah

537
00:27:46,769 --> 00:28:31,328
okay that is like a cigar so basically

538
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:36,429
just hit the yeah and then it takes like

539
00:28:31,328 --> 00:28:40,088
10 or 15 seconds alright wait so get it

540
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:43,509
getting back to everything's from seed

541
00:28:40,088 --> 00:28:46,918
and where are you getting this is it

542
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:48,909
your it's all my personal seed I've been

543
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:51,788
so you're doing the breeding what

544
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:55,239
indoors or how you keeping that one male

545
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:58,769
away from your house does not always the

546
00:28:55,239 --> 00:29:03,058
easiest thing but it just very carefully

547
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:06,038
and I do indoors and trap that Paul and

548
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:08,168
so you put it to you put a stick in the

549
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:09,939
middle right and then you fold it up so

550
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:12,729
you get that drug Jacqueline

551
00:29:09,939 --> 00:29:18,339
yeah yeah that one's not one of my

552
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:24,399
better ones I it's a decent one by used

553
00:29:18,338 --> 00:29:35,378
to own a nursery oh go I know all of

554
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:39,598
them so you've you touched most yeah my

555
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:43,418
brothers had some really good genetics

556
00:29:39,598 --> 00:29:45,638
late 90s yeah that some of it I've been

557
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:55,419
able to hold on do and some of it I've

558
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:59,048
lost right like what did you what did

559
00:29:55,419 --> 00:30:03,249
you miss Halle Oh kaleo's a hard one to

560
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:07,558
find he's got a lot of like the old

561
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:07,558
original like San Fernando Valley stuff

562
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:16,568
what's in the joint

563
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:18,608
it was tangent Angie girl alright

564
00:30:16,568 --> 00:30:20,949
thought daddy so what was this one dad

565
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:34,568
you girl but that's slate that you can

566
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:38,619
actually take yeah that's Dave you sure

567
00:30:34,568 --> 00:30:41,618
can well the microwave knocked

568
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:43,778
everything out like that mom I think the

569
00:30:41,618 --> 00:30:48,718
first they could drive hit I got off the

570
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:48,719
beginning of it yeah let's

571
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:34,420
by the way Saturday night I was all

572
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:37,720
alone back there so what what's been

573
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:41,620
kind of like the history of genetics in

574
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:45,069
the area and I mean is it like what do

575
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:49,689
you travel around like do you see do you

576
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:51,129
go up to like now I kind of see what

577
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,029
they're growing in different places my

578
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:57,370
area kind of I mean yeah problem is

579
00:31:55,029 --> 00:32:00,759
right now is there's a lot of the new

580
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:03,369
stuff that's out there and logics clone

581
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:06,490
material and so there's really nothing

582
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:08,559
that good that's that's that I would say

583
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:12,960
hey yeah this is what we need to make

584
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:15,669
sure this is known in this valley

585
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,920
haven't really found that right there's

586
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:19,990
some hogs brick that's floating around

587
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,029
out there that's that's decent but it's

588
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:24,849
and then you also had the problem of

589
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:27,670
people that are now realizing oh my

590
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:30,730
genetics nobody else has these genetics

591
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:34,240
so no I don't want anybody else to have

592
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:36,309
these genetics you know our garden yeah

593
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,339
now that's what you're finding is a lot

594
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:40,929
of people are like well you know what so

595
00:32:39,339 --> 00:32:43,299
does that imply that like 10 years ago

596
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:49,690
people were like you need seeds here you

597
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:54,069
go they didn't even care really it was

598
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:56,769
like oh you know 10 years ago there it

599
00:32:54,069 --> 00:32:58,450
wasn't you weren't thinking about

600
00:32:56,769 --> 00:33:00,549
spreading genetics the way it was up

601
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,430
north you know the way it was up north

602
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:03,349
was everybody

603
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,539
like all we need to start building up a

604
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:07,449
name with genetics and I need to be a

605
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:11,480
breeder and I need to be known for this

606
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:13,490
cultivar here it's all about money it's

607
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,680
all about what's what's making me money

608
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,509
and what's making me money now and so

609
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,539
it's about where's your market and who's

610
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:24,049
your money yeah I mean it's yeah I'm in

611
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:26,210
volume of course but it's knowing where

612
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:29,839
your market is and who your market is to

613
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:33,319
and you know right here right now is oh

614
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:36,129
geez everybody wants that gassy oh geez

615
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:39,200
you know because most likely it's going

616
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:41,120
so that's you know and so nobody's

617
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,500
really that's all people care about

618
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:47,089
right now they just want to open a bag

619
00:33:42,500 --> 00:34:02,079
and get hit by that gas rather than what

620
00:33:47,089 --> 00:34:05,359
is the cultivar what is deterring but

621
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:07,779
are you growing for the market and then

622
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:11,619
growing for kind of like what you like

623
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:14,509
and they're entirely different things

624
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:17,089
yeah I mean that's what everybody's fine

625
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:20,750
so what do you like like what do you

626
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:23,150
like I like this you know I like fruity

627
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:25,400
with I'm fine like this is fruity but

628
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:28,760
it's got that gas to it it's gonna get

629
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,349
you it's gonna kind of get to stone but

630
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,610
you're not gonna be couch lock you're

631
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:36,679
still gonna be able to have a

632
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:38,630
conversation somewhat you know markets

633
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:42,909
are like real pure markets but they're

634
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:42,910
also because they are the purest market

635
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:49,909
like blind because you really don't know

636
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,699
your end consumer at all you're growing

637
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:57,109
for yourself but in the legal market you

638
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:59,210
have it's like that you know you if it's

639
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:01,700
not selling in stores you're getting

640
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,610
labs well I'm getting laughing about it

641
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:05,230
you have to like

642
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:10,119
[Laughter]

643
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:10,119
you guys want any more this oh you can

644
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,750
we started with an aggressive pace I

645
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:21,858
find that I you know because I consume a

646
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:26,420
lot of cannabis

647
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:28,880
I want that full that full spectrum

648
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,530
flavor of all of it you know it's not

649
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,200
for me I don't want to just be knocked

650
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,519
on my ass you know I want to I want to I

651
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,589
want to function

652
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:39,800
yeah well the function but I also want

653
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:43,309
tend the farms yeah to feel you know I

654
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:46,789
get very creative I've smoked certain

655
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:48,108
cultivars so that's where I want to you

656
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:50,929
know I want I don't want to be on the

657
00:35:48,108 --> 00:35:53,299
book I'm not dying a cancer right you

658
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:55,219
know so for me it's uppity stuff you

659
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,230
know and it's and it's taken those

660
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:59,750
sativas and mixing it with different

661
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,429
things that I know okay this is gonna

662
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,730
get me pretty tough for sick people

663
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:17,329
Wow they're just for this day if you

664
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:19,250
want to be slow I prefer like the lower

665
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:22,460
alcohol wines just because that way you

666
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:24,230
can enjoy it and drink more of it as

667
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,329
opposed to like these high content high

668
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,260
alcoholic oh yeah hmm that's kind of

669
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:28,819
like that sounds like which you're

670
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,320
talking yeah I've never really met about

671
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,000
the fact that different wines of

672
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:39,170
different uh it's a tremendous

673
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:43,608
difference you and your B leagues or

674
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:45,559
more you know depending on yeah that

675
00:36:43,608 --> 00:36:47,329
makes a big difference on how look you

676
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:53,239
know if you like just wanted like you

677
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:55,159
said sense that leg whatever wine has a

678
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:56,989
higher alcohol content but it also has

679
00:36:55,159 --> 00:37:00,349
that flavor body that you just love

680
00:36:56,989 --> 00:37:01,879
you're gonna you maybe just seem a

681
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:03,799
little bit left to sip on it yeah as

682
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,858
opposed to like really it's the same

683
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:09,470
thing here I mean shirkers totally know

684
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:11,619
their modulate their I mean that's the

685
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:14,209
whole point you know my final course

686
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:16,910
mixing flowers when you're smoking them

687
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,500
in a joint is all

688
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:20,539
a way to you know when you're blending

689
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:24,710
like wines you're blending different

690
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:27,110
grapes wool same things and you get this

691
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,909
really cool effect like you just mix a

692
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:30,559
little bit of this at the tip of you

693
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:44,359
know and a little less of this that's

694
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:46,670
the end of a day while I'm working I

695
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,320
smoke a combination to Durban and ACDC

696
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,119
so you get all the focus and

697
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,250
concentration about 30 to 180 CDC

698
00:37:50,119 --> 00:38:00,889
straight but then all the uplifting you

699
00:37:52,250 --> 00:38:03,440
know go get them sativa stomp like

700
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:06,619
that's the gift when you do farms that's

701
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,510
the gift of it is is this gift of being

702
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:10,849
able to play with flowers like nobody

703
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:13,640
else does and so you can you know and

704
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:16,429
then once you start breeding it's really

705
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:19,129
cool because then you you take this this

706
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:21,769
mama and this daddy you know and you

707
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,720
sprinkle them on her and you you know

708
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:26,530
all sudden you have all these children

709
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:30,019
that start throwing these different

710
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:32,210
profiles and then it really gets

711
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:34,789
interesting because then and then when

712
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:37,190
you can sift through that one mother and

713
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:39,259
and then find some children from her

714
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:41,420
that now you're onto something and then

715
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:43,580
you take that kid you mix it with this

716
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,470
is shit that's really that's the future

717
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:48,259
of cannabis because we really don't know

718
00:38:45,469 --> 00:38:50,480
how these certain terpene profiles work

719
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:53,620
with individuals bodies so that's what

720
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,690
we're finding with all these illnesses

721
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:59,239
yeah these cannabinoid effects on on

722
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,220
these you know for instance with the the

723
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:04,309
Charlotte's Web like they're you know

724
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:06,829
and so many patients that they're

725
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:10,880
finding like oh this works for them but

726
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:13,009
this doesn't you know and so now we have

727
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,110
this this field to work with where we

728
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:18,470
can start really mixing a lot of

729
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:21,829
different cannabinoid profiles terpene

730
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:24,829
profiles flavonoid whatever works all

731
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:27,739
sudden you start doing that and then you

732
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:29,920
start mixing them into flowers also to

733
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:31,419
where whether it's you're smoking it or

734
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,548
you're blending it up in a you know a

735
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,889
shake which is phenomenal that's what

736
00:39:33,548 --> 00:39:40,000
you really said as you put them in these

737
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:41,980
fruit these smoothies yeah you want to

738
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,929
get on the level you know and you're not

739
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,059
even you're you get to a point to where

740
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:48,548
you're so homeostasis that you don't

741
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:51,280
even need to smoke because you're you're

742
00:39:48,548 --> 00:39:53,650
just you can deal with everything you're

743
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,160
just in tune because your whole body's

744
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:59,710
like through the gut and all that you

745
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:03,449
know rather than the smoking is cool but

746
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:05,650
we need to really figure out yeah

747
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:09,039
perfect you know we really need to

748
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:11,019
evolve from that into in these different

749
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,298
tinctures that we take away ya know so

750
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:19,588
what do you you have teachers here so

751
00:40:13,298 --> 00:40:26,259
what is that this is some project that

752
00:40:19,588 --> 00:40:31,869
I'm helping working out working on it's

753
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:34,869
a line of THC free so I mean this is

754
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:37,390
we're just trying to work within the

755
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:40,210
regulations of things it you know and

756
00:40:37,389 --> 00:40:43,929
for me it you're finding that a lot of

757
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:50,470
people want to go to THC free and so

758
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:51,730
that's what this line is it's mostly but

759
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:55,618
even if they're not getting high don't

760
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:59,048
you want some cheese in there your

761
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:01,539
I mean that's the balance what's what

762
00:40:59,048 --> 00:41:04,679
the plants doing is taking the iron and

763
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:12,088
it's making CBDs and it's taking

764
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:15,308
magnesium and it's making THC and and

765
00:41:12,088 --> 00:41:16,929
whatever you know when we take that so

766
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:19,180
we see there's so much we don't know but

767
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:21,909
when we take that CBD when we take that

768
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:24,639
THC we're taking essentially the plants

769
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:27,608
iron in the plants magnesium what she

770
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:30,909
did with it or he did you know that and

771
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:34,150
so when you take that into the gut we

772
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:35,920
really don't know what reaction is the

773
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,568
ones doing to the other we're finding

774
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,940
out they both play on each other and

775
00:41:37,568 --> 00:41:41,829
it's very important to have them both

776
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,420
you know flowing through the bud but we

777
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:46,539
really don't know if we have a

778
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:50,430
bunch of THC is that going to cancel out

779
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:55,239
the cb1 receptor or if we have too much

780
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:56,858
CBD is that gonna cancel out the CB - or

781
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:58,328
you know I don't really know the science

782
00:41:56,858 --> 00:42:00,369
I definitely interact with either of

783
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:01,839
those receptors of CBD doesn't it just

784
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:05,048
blocks the teaching going all the way

785
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:07,150
into all the receptors mostly yeah but

786
00:42:05,048 --> 00:42:08,639
what happens if you build up too much of

787
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:11,440
one or the other

788
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:14,858
yeah that's kind of where you know

789
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,980
drowsy so we're this is yeah this is

790
00:42:14,858 --> 00:42:26,259
this is well no this is full-spectrum

791
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:28,298
yeah so zero point three Pam full

792
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:33,970
spectrum ham full spectrum means so

793
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:35,500
little now it stinks we got to work with

794
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:38,639
what we have use these distillates

795
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,639
though when they're playing it apart

796
00:42:39,420 --> 00:43:03,579
just a low THC plan extraction you once

797
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:07,329
right those are the gummies this is the

798
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:08,680
tincture and this is the whoa but the

799
00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:18,818
beauty of this is that you can send it

800
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:20,440
out to be a blow point yeah but see

801
00:43:18,818 --> 00:43:21,849
there's a lot of moms and there's a lot

802
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,240
of parents and there's lot of people out

803
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:27,460
there that don't want to fuck with THC

804
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:29,348
for seven years you know and so it's

805
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:33,159
important to have products out there

806
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:36,910
that people can go to and start baby

807
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:41,469

which solid asking yeah there's some

843
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:57,800
indigo because the way see the plant get

844
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:00,720
you hot reduces it you know it's

845
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,430
impossible to get it to not produce it

846
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,959
it's impossible

847
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:06,480
that's the tough so everybody's

848
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,840
happiness was so much yeah seeing three

849
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,840
copies

850
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:26,769
it's 1% it would save hope you they're

851
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:30,610
gonna go to 2 - we need three three

852
00:46:26,769 --> 00:46:33,159
three and a half let's go for four five

853
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:37,210
let's just put thresholds up on okay

854
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:39,369
anything above 16 you got to be 18 above

855
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:42,490
or 9 to 20 years old buy it whatever

856
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:44,920
anything below you know you should be

857
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:47,500
able to get fucked just like Tylenol

858
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,990
yeah I just don't want them to start

859
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:56,590
doing the graduated taxation base

860
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:58,449
they're gonna do that yes here's the

861
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:01,510
thing is you can already see how they're

862
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:07,899
setting it up there there's gonna be a

863
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:11,560
lot if you're a patient tolerance

864
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:14,230
they're just it's just know already 39

865
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:16,449
percent is it's unacceptable I've told

866
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:18,610
them I mean the most powerful

867
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:21,759
constituency potentially of course is

868
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:24,280
the cannabis consumer if they realize it

869
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,430
but it's not going to happen that okay

870
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,960
but it's an excitatory or another one if

871
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:34,559
you're a patient if you like our

872
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:40,539
legitimate legitimate what's legitimate

873
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:42,960
well my definition is is I'm loose no no

874
00:47:40,539 --> 00:47:48,039
it's rather wide definition it's like

875
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:50,679
well if if you you would use it if if

876
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:53,199
you go home and you have you know

877
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:55,659
whatever you know - after work and

878
00:47:53,199 --> 00:48:04,389
you're gonna smoke a joint rather than

879
00:47:55,659 --> 00:48:17,019
you know other things one could do when

880
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:20,460
one doesn't smoke or if you just use it

881
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:25,409
to maintain homeostasis absolutely

882
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:25,409
so you know sort of like yeah

883
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:37,449

892
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:04,870
with horses and then yeah it's actually

893
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,550

901
00:51:32,110 --> 00:52:14,170
this like yes it's got all those other

902
00:51:38,199 --> 00:52:15,489
benefits we make a tincture THCA is 20

903
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:18,630
times more anti-inflammatory than an

904
00:52:15,489 --> 00:52:18,629
advil is too high

905
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:48,229
advil system now yeah right it's great

906

the CBD was great for the anxiety and

909
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:54,829
the stress that came along with that but

910
00:52:53,268 --> 00:52:56,929
then we made a wonder one with the high

911
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:59,390
CBD a and the high THC a in the same way

912
00:52:56,929 --> 00:53:00,919

00:56:13,728 --> 00:56:16,938
whole thing went down in the seventies

971
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:19,188
in there like oh how do we figure it out

972
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:21,768
would it and why doesn't this property

973
00:56:19,188 --> 00:56:24,139
play and this property does well it was

974
00:56:21,768 --> 00:56:26,618
it was all the science behind there

975
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:33,998
you know there's all the little secret

976
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:36,960
area maybe actually a science wise yes

977
00:56:33,998 --> 00:56:40,000
search me kinetics yes

978
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,858
because I never would say really Sonoma

979
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:47,798
or any of those areas are really like

980
00:56:41,858 --> 00:56:49,690
there's more like well yeah they got out

981
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:51,130
of the fucking city and you went up

982
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:52,568
there because you could hide in the

983
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:55,660
redwoods and you can hide in the hills

984
00:56:52,568 --> 00:56:58,420
up here well we're at we're open we're

985
00:56:55,659 --> 00:57:00,190
out in the open there's no hiding

986
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:02,588
there's a little bit of Redshank you can

987
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:14,769
get under that if you're lucky it's 16

988
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:23,048
feet but everything else and then cured

989
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:26,078
it yeah over time we've learned now

990
00:57:23,048 --> 00:57:42,278
you've learned that you know yeah put it

991
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:44,650
there put it there yeah for sure they

992
00:57:42,278 --> 00:57:47,108
just have to so because we were involved

993
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:52,210
in the grow off the NorCal grow up and

994
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:53,650
it's so Beijing to get like 70 70

995
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:58,900
cultivators got two clippings off the

996
00:57:53,650 --> 00:58:00,519
same plant and then grew them and we're

997
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:05,230
gonna do one of those this year where to

998
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:09,298
where we take same thing do give you

999
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:09,298
know punch cuts off one deal you

1000
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:18,940
submitted and if you told somebody there

1001
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:32,170
were 38 different buds gonna believe

1002
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:34,900
them that's why in the end you know when

1003
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:38,230
when you do encompass the outdoor to

1004
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:40,990
indoors and the markets you know

1005
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:44,318
eventually California's got to realize

1006
00:58:40,989 --> 00:58:49,629
that it's got to take advantage of its

1007
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:50,369
outdoor market yeah pretty much for the

1008
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:52,559
most part

1009
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:58,199
there's a couple different ones then

1010
00:58:52,559 --> 00:59:01,230
there's some Stratus you know but yeah

1011
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:04,679
and the light ski that light ski that

1012
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:11,789
same light cycle you know being on the

1013
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:15,559
parallels like that skis well into the

1014
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:20,059
the the the biosphere like the the

1015
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:22,139
Mediterranean kind of you know biosphere

1016
00:59:20,059 --> 00:59:24,409
it's been getting drunk and cold in

1017
00:59:22,139 --> 00:59:31,379
California that's right like right now

1018
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:35,029
it's averaging I would say 38 up north

1019
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:35,030
it was 40 last week when I was up there

1020
00:59:40,219 --> 00:59:46,529
you don't get a deep freeze for a long

1021
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:50,880
time which it does cut oh I guess snow

1022
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:54,030
oh yeah I get several storms every year

1023
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:57,420
to where I'll get at least especially

1024
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:59,970
last few years to where you know I'll

1025
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:04,110
get five inches and it'll last a day or

1026
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:06,209
two I don't know that's the thing you're

1027
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:20,130
right on that layer where you're not

1028
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:22,889
shoveling I just do a full-time Oh from

1029
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:24,210
so do most people in your area do it use

1030
01:00:22,889 --> 01:00:26,250
new life if you're in it for the money

1031
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:28,619
you're gonna do it for as much as you're

1032
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:30,179
gonna do it as quick as you can and

1033
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:31,589
you're gonna do it from clones and

1034
01:00:30,179 --> 01:00:34,559
you're gonna do it you know you're not

1035
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:37,800
gonna care how you're gonna do it bottom

1036
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:39,179
lines how much might make you know if

1037
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,400
you do it and you got love and you put

1038
01:00:39,179 --> 01:00:44,759
into it and then it's different you know

1039
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:46,289
it's a process called the marathon you

1040
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:49,710
know it's a process you know you're not

1041
01:00:46,289 --> 01:00:51,420
doing it yeah the money is great cuz we

1042
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:53,070
all got to pay bills we all go to feed

1043
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,740
ourselves but if that's why you're doing

1044
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:58,019
it you're gonna lose in this business

1045
01:00:54,739 --> 01:00:59,149
you know because this is culture in the

1046
01:00:58,019 --> 01:01:01,400
end

1047
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:03,710
you know this so many people are coming

1048
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:05,570
into it right now and like all woods new

1049
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:07,340
it's this new business and how we're

1050
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:09,230
gonna do the regulation how we're gonna

1051
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:11,539
do this and that this business has been

1052
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:14,900
around for decades centuries it's not

1053
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:17,300
new it's been around for so long you can

1054
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:19,039
do all the regulation you want people

1055
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:21,289
are still gonna do what they do

1056
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:22,909
you can put all see that's the problem

1057
01:01:21,289 --> 01:01:24,710
is you get companies that come in and

1058
01:01:22,909 --> 01:01:27,170
think I'm gonna get the first license

1059
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:29,690
and I'm gonna monopolize this area and

1060
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:30,740
I'm gonna be the guy you know fuck

1061
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:33,409
everybody else

1062
01:01:30,739 --> 01:01:36,199
I'm canopy group and I got four fucking

1063
01:01:33,409 --> 01:01:38,359
billion dollars right and and so I'm

1064
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:40,309
just gonna come in and we're gonna

1065
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,620
monopolize I'm gonna on briella you guys

1066
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:45,139
and we're gonna buy up everything we're

1067
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:47,029
buy up all the licenses and we're gonna

1068
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:48,469
monopolize it no you're not gonna

1069
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:51,140
fucking monopolize there

1070
01:01:48,469 --> 01:01:52,669
you're not going to good luck look at

1071
01:01:51,139 --> 01:01:55,190
what they tried to do in the 30s they

1072
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:58,550
tried to monopolize it you know the

1073
01:01:55,190 --> 01:02:00,710
whole petrochemical industry monopolized

1074
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:03,590
this plant and said no you can't use

1075
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:07,070
this plant because our patents are

1076
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:08,720
inferior to this plant and we can't make

1077
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:12,140
the billions of dollars and we're

1078
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:16,849
insecure oh fuck you know I'm not

1079
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:20,119
insecure about that you know and you had

1080
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:22,039
the AMA the head dude of the MAA go in

1081
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:25,099
front of Congress and say what the fuck

1082
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:27,050
are you doing for one if you weren't

1083
01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:29,329
calling it marijuana the farmers would

1084
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:32,810
be out here with the pitchforks and hang

1085

over everyone's eyes and now they're

1089
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:45,070

1090
01:02:42,769 --> 01:02:47,329
billion dollars because they're idiots

1091
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:50,050

we're gonna you know

1093
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:57,400

1112
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:53,230
whole new business like how we're gonna

and they're just trying to put food on

1123
01:04:20,619 --> 01:04:26,259
the table they don't have access because

you have yeah exactly yeah no I'm doing

1182
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:50,029
them what could stay like the vineyards

1183
01:09:47,329 --> 01:09:52,819
but but hemp to grow a lot bigger but I

1184
01:09:50,029 --> 01:09:54,469
yeah I'm hoping I get a taproot like you

1185
01:09:52,819 --> 01:10:06,710
were talking about the dry farming yeah

1186
01:09:54,470 --> 01:10:07,780
if I get an 8 6 to 8 foot tap arou about

1187
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:12,850
six feet apart

1188
01:10:07,779 --> 01:10:17,420
yeah six feet with about 8 foot yeah

1189
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:23,060
machine a lot of hand is it really a lot

1190
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:25,880
of hands yeah everybody's a lot of

1191
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:31,670
people are just doing you know straight

1192
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:33,659
you know three foot plants you know real

1193
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:36,090
bunched up and trying to fit you know

1194
01:10:33,658 --> 01:10:38,219
three four thousand plants into an acre

1195
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:39,690
you're talking about of hemp yeah yeah

1196
01:10:38,219 --> 01:10:41,698
that's what they're doing in Camarillo

1197
01:10:39,689 --> 01:10:43,619
they were all like they're all flowering

1198
01:10:41,698 --> 01:10:49,738
and they're like four feet tall your

1199
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:50,849
biggest one in two turns no well no

1200
01:10:49,738 --> 01:10:53,579
they're just they're putting them out

1201
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:55,889
there at veg yet maybe you know on a

1202
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:59,309
foot and a half two feet and then

1203
01:10:55,889 --> 01:11:02,190
they're getting another you know maybe a

1204
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:03,840
month of veg out of them and then

1205
01:11:02,189 --> 01:11:08,460
they're going into flower at four feet

1206
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:11,699
and they're getting you know pound pound

1207
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:15,600
and a half if they're lucky I'd like to

1208
01:11:11,698 --> 01:11:18,259
see is three to four pounds a flower you

1209
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:21,810
know eight pounds of biomass talking

1210
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:24,960
trunk in root and the whole this whole

1211
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:27,659
plan do you have seeds right you cut

1212
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,760
down use and you now you you're not

1213
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:32,369
using as many plants you're not using as

1214
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:39,869
much water to keep so many plants going

1215
01:11:32,369 --> 01:11:44,779
you know so there's definitely a benefit

1216
01:11:39,869 --> 01:11:44,779
in it it's a lot more labor but I think

1217
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:49,529
the best vineyards are the guys are

1218
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:52,619
walking up and down the video it's

1219
01:11:49,529 --> 01:11:55,079
playing every day how do you so choose

1220
01:11:52,619 --> 01:11:56,639
your hand like what to grow what is that

1221
01:11:55,079 --> 01:12:01,039
right now I don't know really to be

1222
01:11:56,639 --> 01:12:01,039
honest with you that's like a whole new

1223
01:12:06,139 --> 01:12:10,319
happens in this is something that you

1224
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:12,779
know we're in the new territory of what

1225
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:15,869
genetics work in your what sort of ours

1226
01:12:12,779 --> 01:12:19,948
walk in your area exactly what was hot

1227
01:12:15,869 --> 01:12:21,479
me over point three percent oh and

1228
01:12:19,948 --> 01:12:22,919
that's a fine line so what you're saying

1229
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:24,539
is if you get up to one or two percent

1230
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,859
which you're shooting for then all the

1231
01:12:24,539 --> 01:12:27,899
sudden things that were just over point

1232
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:29,339
three years Olli do you try to do in

1233
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:34,158
then you'll go right up to the line and

1234
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:34,159
so it goes yes a Weibull of that line

1235
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:40,260
[Music]

1236
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:58,880
let me see the Iran jyothi's doing

1237
01:12:57,109 --> 01:13:02,238
cheese out of it just like that you know

1238
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:36,828
you go by the bags and use just couple

1239
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:38,509
grams or whatever cuz CBD stops the tea

1240
01:13:36,828 --> 01:13:43,069
this tea even going all the way to this

1241
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:45,559
one receptor so I said yeah it's a way

1242
01:13:43,069 --> 01:13:47,210
but actually more feeling not that this

1243
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:49,699
is uncomfortable but for a lot of people

1244
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:51,020
like ever at the air old cups and all

1245
01:13:49,698 --> 01:13:53,719
the things that don't go get too high a

1246
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:55,460
couple of drops for sad make sure yeah

1247
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:57,439
it's it's a view it just started dabbing

1248
01:13:55,460 --> 01:14:02,420
yeah that's why the couch it the two are

1249
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:04,178
the two moms over there like oh yeah but

1250
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:09,920
a couple of drops of the high CBD oil

1251
01:14:04,179 --> 01:14:11,868
bring you right to fuck out of that go

1252
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:23,750
from trying to call the hospital to take

1253
01:14:11,868 --> 01:14:24,738
it a deep breath and being okay so you

1254
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,359
can get a little because this is

1255
01:14:24,738 --> 01:14:28,459
gratefully said focus and concentration

1256
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:33,198
you know like your view or driving you

1257
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:34,578
to pay attention later no it's the t-shi

1258
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:37,250
from going all the way into the cb1

1259
01:14:34,578 --> 01:14:39,828
receptor okay so teams block the

1260
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:41,359
receptors blog they can add lie from

1261
01:14:39,828 --> 01:14:42,710
going into the receptor I don't think I

1262
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:44,269
could find none they don't think it

1263
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:45,920
blocks a receptor I think it blocks the

1264
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:46,480
cannabinoid from going to other partisan

1265
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,750
have annoyed

1266
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:51,579
because they've already gotten to the

1267
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:54,100
reset that does it pulls it out it stops

1268
01:14:51,579 --> 01:15:11,069
it yeah interesting that's why you're

1269
01:14:54,100 --> 01:15:11,070
too high quite a tool you've got here

1270
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:21,760
his client came out Carol is like I want

1271

1273
01:15:34,289 --> 01:15:44,010
between the paper wool I work with

by uh-huh so he started out doing co2

1278
01:15:52,329 --> 01:16:01,090
extraction so he got a PhD in analytical

1279
01:15:56,739 --> 01:16:02,590
chemistry in the late 90s and then he's

1280
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:05,470
been doing extraction like ever since

1281
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:07,690
and started like it's cool yeah so he's

1282

of other people in business you know

1286
01:16:15,189 --> 01:16:20,439
yeah doing that kind of stuff but but

1287
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:22,449
yeah so it's like thank you to kind of

1288
01:16:20,439 --> 01:16:25,210
know but it's interesting to talk to you

1289
01:16:22,449 --> 01:16:26,470
guys with seitan you know like learning

1290
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:27,939
all about like the different

1291
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:28,810
cannabinoids I mean there's so many out

1292
01:16:27,939 --> 01:16:30,639
there what you were talking about

1293
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:32,560
earlier it's like you everyone's

1294
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,600
learning about how different

1295
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,400
cannabinoids can affect different things

1296
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,810
and they're gonna and we're all we're

1297
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:39,219
still learning about which there's so

1298
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:41,380
many of them and we're still learning

1299
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:43,119
about what's gonna help one because one

1300
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:46,210
thing helps one thing but that is

1301
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:49,479
another part of the pharmaceutic

1302
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:51,279
is already in cannabis they own all the

1303
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:53,199
magnets all those guys on and that's why

1304
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:56,259
the patents the things that you know

1305
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:59,639
that you make dinner you know staying

1306
01:16:56,260 --> 01:17:02,079
away from small farmers are now starting

1307
01:16:59,639 --> 01:17:04,690
see that's the problem I'm having with

1308
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:06,279
with local government and stuff there's

1309
01:17:04,689 --> 01:17:08,829
a lot of people and along with

1310
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:11,559
California they're missing out on this

1311
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:13,179
opportunity of these small farms and

1312
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,119
getting these patents in these

1313
01:17:13,179 --> 01:17:17,770
Appalachians start any lawyers or that I

1314
01:17:16,118 --> 01:17:19,149
mean yeah you know and then people were

1315
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:21,280
holding on to them but even with

1316
01:17:19,149 --> 01:17:23,259
Appalachians at some point no matter

1317
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,939
what protect because you get it you have

1318
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:28,900
to protect it you have to go out there

1319
01:17:24,939 --> 01:17:30,669
and protect it yeah totally and I agree

1320
01:17:28,899 --> 01:17:32,829
with Rhodes and I agree with you but I

1321
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:36,399
don't have that gateway and people

1322
01:17:32,829 --> 01:17:39,460
companies like Bayer and you know do not

1323
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:41,888
I mean yeah but but but but but smaller

1324
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:44,560
operations are starting to realize that

1325
01:17:41,889 --> 01:17:47,230
that but ultimately that's their only

1326
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:49,119
route to protection those others they're

1327
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:51,069
doing good that's the key to my survival

1328
01:17:49,118 --> 01:17:53,589
Robert that's the key to my survival

1329
01:17:51,069 --> 01:17:53,979
nobody else can do what I can do on my

1330
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:56,159
land

1331
01:17:53,979 --> 01:17:58,629
no one else can say that they're growing

1332
01:17:56,158 --> 01:18:01,089
with your Appalachian this will this

1333
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:03,670
certain hold the var that this only

1334
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:05,020
these scenes that were genetically see

1335
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:07,329
that's what I was trying to get out of

1336
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:10,830
earlier is what happened so Champaign is

1337
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:14,109
like and when you go to the top raped

1338
01:18:10,829 --> 01:18:16,090
raped and they lost time after time

1339
01:18:14,109 --> 01:18:17,859
after time and loss actually in the

1340
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:19,630
ports of their Appalachian and now it's

1341
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:23,289
too late there's no putting the asshole

1342
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:26,109
back in the body no the next Champaign

1343
01:18:23,289 --> 01:18:28,810
and that's a learning point for people

1344
01:18:26,109 --> 01:18:32,439
one of Asians right that's totally a

1345
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:35,110
learning spot I think the appellation is

1346
01:18:32,439 --> 01:18:37,629
part of the key to the Appalachian the

1347
01:18:35,109 --> 01:18:40,960
cultivar the farm the farmer you know

1348
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:43,600
and you know anybody can kind of be the

1349
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:46,750
farmer once that techniques taught but

1350
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:49,090
nobody can be the land and nothing can

1351
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:51,399
be the cultivar except for that genetic

1352
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:54,069
strain and so if you hold on to that

1353
01:18:51,399 --> 01:18:56,408
bear can't duplicate that you know bear

1354
01:18:54,069 --> 01:18:58,479
come you want to duplicate that and a

1355
01:18:56,408 --> 01:19:01,210
lot of companies can try and get pretty

1356
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:04,868
close to duplicating it but in the end

1357
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:09,158
if you do it right and that Appalachians

1358
01:19:04,868 --> 01:19:12,189
protected then you know numbers go a

1359
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:12,969
long way you know and so if you got

1360
01:19:12,189 --> 01:19:16,059
enough people

1361
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:17,980
behind you you know and I think that's

1362
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:20,680
in the end that's what's gonna protect a

1363
01:19:17,979 --> 01:19:22,269
small farmer is you know being in the

1364
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:24,940
right area you know the people that

1365
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:27,430
aren't in the right area you know and

1366
01:19:24,939 --> 01:19:29,589
want a future in farming probably aren't

1367
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:33,610
gonna have one thing about Appalachians

1368
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:35,140
it's not just the soil and it's not just

1369
01:19:33,609 --> 01:19:35,679
that you that it's the history of the

1370
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:38,950
region

1371
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:41,980
it's the technique it's all of those

1372
01:19:38,949 --> 01:19:43,840
little nuances and it is the grower you

1373
01:19:41,979 --> 01:19:46,389
know that's like a part of all of those

1374
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,860
that mix that magic you guys all had to

1375
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:49,690
use the same technique because I feel

1376
01:19:47,859 --> 01:19:52,299
like with champagne don't they all have

1377
01:19:49,689 --> 01:19:54,039
to do the same technique and all like do

1378
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:57,610
things at the exact same time as each

1379
01:19:54,039 --> 01:20:04,810
other you know what's more important

1380
01:19:57,609 --> 01:20:08,559
into the terre law guaranteeing is a

1381
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:10,420
product that is consistent you know and

1382
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,980
so you're getting when you're getting a

1383
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:14,670
certain cheese or you're getting a

1384
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:18,869
certain wine or certain you know

1385
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:22,779
whatever it may be but you know tequila

1386
01:20:18,869 --> 01:20:25,149
that globby comes that grows in tequila

1387
01:20:22,779 --> 01:20:26,829
a certain way you know and so you're

1388
01:20:25,149 --> 01:20:28,750
getting a certain guaranteed of a

1389
01:20:26,829 --> 01:20:31,510
product and so that's what important

1390
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:33,850
about establishing appellations and

1391
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:36,699
cannabis is establishing the cultivar

1392
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:39,789
also along with it you know and what's

1393
01:20:36,699 --> 01:20:41,529
gonna thrive there for everybody and

1394
01:20:39,789 --> 01:20:45,100
then the practices you know standards

1395
01:20:41,529 --> 01:20:48,489
elected what what cultivars are on the

1396
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:51,760
table for were you I think I think you

1397
01:20:48,489 --> 01:20:58,329
know heavy indicas are going to be the

1398
01:20:51,760 --> 01:21:01,840
dominant stuff that stuff that works

1399
01:20:58,329 --> 01:21:04,210
with that parallel in time and in

1400
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:06,970
history you know and not trying to

1401
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:09,730
reinvent the wheel going you know

1402
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:11,949
working with what what is there and I

1403
01:21:09,729 --> 01:21:15,039
know that you know heavy indicas are

1404
01:21:11,949 --> 01:21:18,130
what's gonna thrive there you know and

1405
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:21,819
then from there is as a matter of

1406
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:23,760
figuring out what works best there will

1407
01:21:21,819 --> 01:21:25,979
there be better years for

1408
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,690
is just like with the grapes definitely

1409
01:21:25,979 --> 01:21:30,029
definitely definitely definitely

1410
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:31,409
definitely I think dad's gonna be like

1411
01:21:30,029 --> 01:21:35,639
we were talking earlier about doing the

1412
01:21:31,409 --> 01:21:37,859
cigars doing some you know having us you

1413
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:40,260
know something that's that time capsule

1414
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:42,799
from that farm and that you know that so

1415
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:45,930
if you made one let's say you have made

1416
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:50,130
50 of these and they were marked as

1417
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:52,409
coming from 2024 and they were made a

1418
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:54,480
certain way over time they would have

1419
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:57,750
value I think so

1420
01:21:54,479 --> 01:22:03,659
well I think you know what and if enough

1421
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:05,909
people smoked it - well you but but the

1422
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:08,880
value would be earned but oh yeah either

1423
01:22:05,909 --> 01:22:10,229
it would happen it would have value you

1424
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,600
knows what we're appreciated you know

1425
01:22:10,229 --> 01:22:16,409
but it's also my TV show yeah with

1426
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:18,360
increasing value just like just like the

1427
01:22:16,409 --> 01:22:22,349
template it would be you guys know like

1428
01:22:18,359 --> 01:22:27,899
wine right yeah like red wine if you get

1429
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:31,070
too late the guards change I mean you

1430
01:22:27,899 --> 01:22:31,069
can keep a cigar humidor

1431
01:22:32,539 --> 01:22:40,859
what tobacco doesn't degrade from THCA

1432
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:43,409
to THC to Delta a to CBS so if you don't

1433
01:22:40,859 --> 01:22:47,069
changing cannabinoids over time back oh

1434
01:22:43,409 --> 01:22:48,988
just but perhaps in a less tobacco so if

1435
01:22:47,069 --> 01:22:52,500
you create the temple bowl and Frenchy

1436
01:22:48,988 --> 01:22:58,109
you know if you're keeping it like

1437
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:58,619
temperature-wise still oldy carbs yeah I

1438
01:22:58,109 --> 01:23:00,420
got you

1439
01:22:58,619 --> 01:23:02,010
time heat and pressure but he said

1440
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:04,079
there's no it should slow it down but

1441
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,940
you said they improve so the temple

1442
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:09,569
balls difference is good news you know I

1443
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:14,159
like to use the human how as a person

1444
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:18,059
I think there's some character there but

1445
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:21,029
the the health of the product isn't

1446
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:23,130
quite there and so yes there's a lot of

1447
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:24,710
character there and so it depends if

1448
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:27,930
it's something that you're smoking

1449
01:23:24,710 --> 01:23:29,730
possibly it could be a different effect

1450
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:33,329
it can be a different you know because

1451
01:23:29,729 --> 01:23:34,229
it's suppression spiritual whatever just

1452
01:23:33,329 --> 01:23:36,600
in you know

1453
01:23:34,229 --> 01:23:38,729
whatever it may be for you yes but I

1454
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:41,820
think as a product as a you know it

1455
01:23:38,729 --> 01:23:44,429
loses its hole by it Peaks out that gets

1456
01:23:41,819 --> 01:23:45,869
to a point to where it so it won't be so

1457
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:48,510
we did the three different Durbin's the

1458
01:23:45,869 --> 01:23:52,140
other day the 2019 was this bright you

1459
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:55,920
know vibrant go get them the 2018 was a

1460
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:57,750
more like full-body complex and the 2017

1461
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,520
you could tell had aged didn't quite

1462
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:02,250
have the terpenes didn't quite have the

1463
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:04,230
flavor coming through it but the nuances

1464
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:06,390
of the 2017 we're really neat

1465
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:07,829
it wasn't our favorite one but you got

1466
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:09,090
to smoke the you each kind of cannabis

1467
01:24:07,829 --> 01:24:10,829
another one like that people people he

1468
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:11,340
refreshed I want fresh leaf fresh isn't

1469
01:24:10,829 --> 01:24:13,229
always better

1470
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:15,720
you know it's got an aged into things

1471
01:24:13,229 --> 01:24:17,250
you know the friggin right core fill all

1472
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:19,440
the stuff gotta come out of it like not

1473
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:21,090
one cures their cannabis properly that's

1474
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:22,589
one people rush it to market you know

1475
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:23,909
it's really nice to see how kind of his

1476
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:27,210
ages and right

1477
01:24:23,909 --> 01:24:27,630
furro we haven't been a part of that

1478
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:29,310
process

1479
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:31,109
ever before so it was really neat to

1480
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:35,850
finally see there was early because I

1481
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:38,460
said to be able to go back to that 2017

1482
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:43,470
and deal the you know so oh wow there is

1483
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:45,239
this difference to say no I'll be added

1484
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:47,760
no it's just in jars just you know but

1485
01:24:45,238 --> 01:24:49,500
it been in jar for three years now yeah

1486
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,670
but you say we open it up and the

1487
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,738
terpenes are still there you can

1488
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:55,279
definitely tell it's Durbin you know it

1489
01:24:52,738 --> 01:24:58,019
wasn't quite as poppy as the 2018-2019

1490
01:24:55,279 --> 01:24:59,309
you know but it oxidized a little bit

1491
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:01,170
you know there was a little desk color

1492
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:03,180
into it but think about the temple balls

1493
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:05,970
was the coating gets hard so he inside

1494
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:07,590
scraps is preserved yeah yeah that's why

1495
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:09,119
I don't make the hash so it so they

1496
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:10,949
could travel with it you know it's about

1497
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:12,420
that when you manipulate by the process

1498
01:25:10,949 --> 01:25:16,439
so no I think it's a great in a

1499
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:18,539
different way yeah things that need to

1500
01:25:16,439 --> 01:25:19,799
be explored more yeah once they start

1501
01:25:18,539 --> 01:25:21,000
letting us study that you know and you

1502
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:24,650
can start studying the individual

1503
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,359
terpenes and cannabinoids and shit you I

1504
01:25:24,649 --> 01:25:29,309
mean I the reason I was asking was

1505
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:33,149
because you know so he works with

1506
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:35,789
aficionado and so and surround us yeah

1507
01:25:33,149 --> 01:25:38,279
and they were but now actually has his

1508
01:25:35,789 --> 01:25:40,979
own stuff on the market so would Willy

1509
01:25:38,279 --> 01:25:44,309
would we see one day like like that my

1510
01:25:40,979 --> 01:25:46,409
father's eighteen year old you're likely

1511
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:48,270
to see aged hashed and you are aged

1512
01:25:46,409 --> 01:25:51,119
cannabis is no idle people ever CH

1513
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:52,770
cannabis people for what you yeah not

1514
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:55,859
like that I mean it go back but like

1515
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:57,750
wine some wines have 20 year life some

1516
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:59,250
wines only have a five year life some

1517
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:01,439
weird ones haven't we really you know

1518
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:03,750
it's different it's a great past there

1519
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:05,359
but it might be that you grew something

1520
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:08,670
where one season it was like

1521
01:26:05,359 --> 01:26:11,460
exceptionally it's like oh it's always

1522
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:13,409
like that wouldn't him it's always been

1523
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:15,720
like that when something is exceptional

1524
01:26:13,409 --> 01:26:20,189
that and whenever it hit the LA County

1525
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:23,460
line it was bombed I was like because

1526
01:26:20,189 --> 01:26:27,409
people knew you know so and so it might

1527
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:29,130
was born fast but the met your memories

1528
01:26:27,409 --> 01:26:31,050
it's plenty the parallels between

1529
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:33,210
cameras and wine every time I keep

1530
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:36,420
talking about just seems yeah there's

1531
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:39,109
well it's just the product the to where

1532
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:42,800
there's a lot of parallels definitely

1533
01:26:39,109 --> 01:26:48,269
but to it's kind of two different worlds

1534
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:53,750
you know ones pre annual ones the annual

1535
01:26:48,270 --> 01:27:00,620
and the cycles are a lot different but

1536
01:26:53,750 --> 01:27:09,960
definitely for culture yeah yeah yeah I

1537
01:27:00,619 --> 01:27:12,479
would say so yeah right that's when you

1538
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:15,390
get on that next level is when you start

1539
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:17,909
mixing those two just at the cannabis

1540
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:20,130
cafe now you can there's a back porch

1541
01:27:17,909 --> 01:27:22,710
you can get food have wine and beer now

1542
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:24,690
and then you can go inside smoke and eat

1543
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:26,279
inside but you can't know it's there's a

1544
01:27:24,689 --> 01:27:29,399
door but you can't smoke outside you

1545
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:31,199
can't drink inside what fuck ya add an

1546
01:27:29,399 --> 01:27:33,119
appetizer and a glass of wine came

1547
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:35,789
inside and had dinner and dessert and

1548
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:36,989
smoked all the pots so that's fuckin

1549
01:27:35,789 --> 01:27:40,560
great that's great

1550
01:27:36,989 --> 01:27:42,800
is so fun plans everywhere the few more

1551
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,800
years

1552
01:27:42,949 --> 01:27:47,809
yeah wheels right to be

1553
01:27:49,179 --> 01:27:53,498
there should be at least that option but

1554
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:58,328
also that was that was the great thing

1555
01:27:53,498 --> 01:28:00,819
about the the Emerald exchange is being

1556
01:27:58,328 --> 01:28:04,389
able to go up and see all these

1557
01:28:00,819 --> 01:28:10,688
different farmers and their product at

1558
01:28:04,389 --> 01:28:22,389
the same place was my first my first big

1559
01:28:10,689 --> 01:28:25,420
event to see their horn it's a different

1560
01:28:22,389 --> 01:28:27,489
culture the desert growing culture

1561
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:29,170
different those two that's the whole

1562
01:28:27,488 --> 01:28:32,129
problem right now with the two different

1563
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:34,899
worlds you know a lot of the northern

1564
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:38,069
those farms up there look down here and

1565
01:28:34,899 --> 01:28:40,268
don't respect the farms down here and

1566
01:28:38,069 --> 01:28:43,840
you know there's something good going

1567
01:28:40,269 --> 01:28:46,900
down down here and we all got to work

1568
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:49,090
together and understand

1569
01:28:46,899 --> 01:28:52,208
California's two are as a whole needs to

1570
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:54,130
be protected you know well you have a

1571
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:56,828
really good story to tell

1572
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:58,989
yeah a lot of us do up there you know a

1573
01:28:56,828 --> 01:29:03,938
lot of a lot of these farmers in SoCal

1574
01:28:58,988 --> 01:29:05,589
and NorCal in general market down here

1575
01:29:03,939 --> 01:29:07,389
you're not allowed to grow outdoor

1576
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:09,610
flower you can only get into our

1577
01:29:07,389 --> 01:29:11,139
licenses yes what hinders that I think

1578
01:29:09,609 --> 01:29:12,969
that's part of the problem between North

1579
01:29:11,139 --> 01:29:14,920
Cal and SoCal is if they believe in the

1580
01:29:12,969 --> 01:29:17,078
Sun in NorCal and they want help in the

1581
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:19,118
legal market they're not allowed to use

1582
01:29:17,078 --> 01:29:20,828
the Sun like they should be able to done

1583
01:29:19,118 --> 01:29:22,509
your flock and it's not necessarily

1584
01:29:20,828 --> 01:29:25,179
anyone's fault except for the lawmakers

1585
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:27,550
you know it's bad well as the money is

1586
01:29:25,179 --> 01:29:29,559
creating that dichotomy the money too

1587
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:30,939
many greedy people look at it like oh

1588
01:29:29,559 --> 01:29:32,559
we're gonna make money here and we're

1589
01:29:30,939 --> 01:29:35,679
gonna make money you know we're gonna do

1590
01:29:32,559 --> 01:29:38,769
it our way don't look at how just let

1591
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:42,630
things be and let let it be agriculture

1592
01:29:38,769 --> 01:29:42,630
let the plant thrive where she thrives

1593
01:29:43,349 --> 01:29:49,659
all hemp is is a war dramatic word for

1594
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:52,328
cannabis you know so when you use hemp

1595
01:29:49,658 --> 01:29:56,259
it's like what about hemp will happen is

1596
01:29:52,328 --> 01:29:58,960
be farmed in a responsible manner you

1597
01:29:56,260 --> 01:30:00,640
know and it's not lately it hasn't

1598
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:03,159
you know it says all sun is being turned

1599
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:31,750
into this mono crop let's fucking blue

1600
01:30:03,159 --> 01:30:34,059
eco I'm 208-908-7815 I'm not trying to

1601
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:36,430
hate on that but at the same time let's

1602
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:40,150
just ease into it yeah let's do as much

1603
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:42,789
as we can but responsibly responsibly

1604
01:30:40,149 --> 01:30:44,409
you know and that's the thing is there's

1605
01:30:42,789 --> 01:30:46,840
a lot a lot of people losing their ass

1606
01:30:44,409 --> 01:30:48,130
right now in the hemp industry that jump

1607
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,260
didn't do it thinking they're gonna make

1608
01:30:48,130 --> 01:30:51,850
a lot of money and a lot of promises not

1609
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:53,980
if you were somebody that got into some

1610
01:30:51,850 --> 01:30:56,410
stock and got out quit you know knew the

1611
01:30:53,979 --> 01:30:58,299
game but you know if you're a farmer and

1612
01:30:56,409 --> 01:31:01,300
you thought oh wow this is what's gonna

1613
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:03,190
finally bail me out you know and it

1614
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:07,210
didn't bail you out you know you're

1615
01:31:03,189 --> 01:31:09,519
thinking what the fuck there's so many

1616
01:31:07,210 --> 01:31:12,039
people coming into this game 20 years

1617
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:15,370
too late looking for that money that

1618
01:31:12,039 --> 01:31:17,829
isn't there anymore you know and and

1619
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:19,300

1620
01:31:17,829 --> 01:31:22,300
are you know losing their ass in this

1621
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:24,219
industry and they don't need to because

1622
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:26,440
it is in all what it is it's agriculture

1623
01:31:24,219 --> 01:31:28,930
you know and you got all this new

1624
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:30,699
inventions of lights and all this shit

1625
01:31:28,930 --> 01:31:33,579
you know yeah if I'm on the East Coast

1626
01:31:30,699 --> 01:31:36,189
and I can't use the god-given Sun that's

1627
01:31:33,579 --> 01:31:39,519
wonderful you know from my trying to

1628
01:31:36,189 --> 01:31:41,409
make some specific medicine strain that

1629
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:43,090
just needs to you know that I want to do

1630
01:31:41,409 --> 01:31:45,849
in a controlled environment and I don't

1631
01:31:43,090 --> 01:31:47,770
I don't discipline passive solar like

1632
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:49,780
greenhouses like you know there's

1633
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:52,750
certain passive solar greenhouses that

1634
01:31:49,779 --> 01:31:56,369
are regenitive and you're not sucking

1635
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:59,380
off the grid or awesome yeah you know

1636
01:31:56,369 --> 01:32:01,569
yeah the basic greenhouse you know but

1637
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:05,170
you're using the Sun in a way that you

1638
01:32:01,569 --> 01:32:06,859
know you're not normal greenhouse yeah

1639
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:10,359
you got a lot more control yeah

1640
01:32:06,859 --> 01:32:14,000
you need to have control coz of pests

1641
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:17,210
well that's a thing what I learned

1642
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:20,560
breeding I've learned to be able to

1643
01:32:17,210 --> 01:32:23,329
breed certain genetics that work and

1644
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:25,130
that don't okay I get a certain amount

1645
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:27,170
of pests in this region all right let's

1646
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:30,949
let's get a little more limonene in

1647
01:32:27,170 --> 01:32:32,719
there you know or the eucalyptus you

1648
01:32:30,948 --> 01:32:35,178
know there's certain Terps that you can

1649
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:38,090
get into the plant that you don't see

1650
01:32:35,179 --> 01:32:39,590
that are pests yeah that's the shit that

1651
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:41,480
people don't understand and why I'm

1652
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:42,800
growing this shit here and and I don't

1653
01:32:41,479 --> 01:32:44,959
and they're wondering why they're

1654
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:47,360
getting infestation you know because

1655
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:50,779
you're attracting it you know and in

1656
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:52,609
whatever cultivars growing yeah and so

1657
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:55,158
once people start learning all I put

1658
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:57,649
this here then that's when shit starts

1659
01:32:55,158 --> 01:32:59,569
clicking you know and and the real ad

1660
01:32:57,649 --> 01:33:02,089
comes out see people are trying to use

1661
01:32:59,569 --> 01:33:05,090
the old twenty year model of hiding it

1662
01:33:02,090 --> 01:33:07,550
indoors when it was illegal and that's

1663
01:33:05,090 --> 01:33:09,619
what the regs going to okay now we need

1664
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:13,429
to put it indoors cuz we need to control

1665
01:33:09,618 --> 01:33:16,519
it because it's marijuana and you know

1666
01:33:13,429 --> 01:33:19,069
like it doesn't make sense it's just

1667
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:21,260
like you got fuck these are super

1668
01:33:19,069 --> 01:33:23,779
structures being built and Coachella and

1669
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:26,239
out and out along tow I mean literally

1670
01:33:23,779 --> 01:33:31,939
like fucking warehouses and in these

1671
01:33:26,238 --> 01:33:33,919
places are the carbon footprint they're

1672
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:35,839
gonna cause I don't care if they're

1673
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,760
they're making their own energy they're

1674
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:39,679
just gonna be dissing general i'ma just

1675
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:42,079
be in there and what they're gonna

1676
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:43,969
create a few jobs you know put that in

1677
01:33:42,079 --> 01:33:46,010
an area to where the plant grows good

1678
01:33:43,969 --> 01:33:47,630
and if those people really truly love

1679
01:33:46,010 --> 01:33:50,119
being in the industry they'll move there

1680
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:52,310
you know and though you know that's what

1681
01:33:50,118 --> 01:33:55,549
they'll do just like in the grape

1682
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:59,929
industry you know or the avocados or

1683
01:33:55,550 --> 01:34:05,779
oranges it sounds like you don't use a

1684
01:33:59,929 --> 01:34:08,639
lot of power no I can't afford it

1685
01:34:05,779 --> 01:34:12,719
it's I don't have it in my budget

1686
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:13,618
you know ya know I uses less power you

1687
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:19,139
know shit

1688
01:34:13,618 --> 01:34:21,839
maybe when the TV's on yeah I don't you

1689
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:23,730
know just doesn't make sense

1690
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:28,560
for me yeah I mean when I'm trying to

1691
01:34:23,729 --> 01:34:30,539
veg I'll do a little bit but I try to

1692
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:34,170
stay where I try to use as much Sun as

1693
01:34:30,539 --> 01:34:35,969
possible why not you know it's there I'm

1694
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:38,219
getting that full spectrum of you v's

1695
01:34:35,969 --> 01:34:42,539
that the plant knows that the plant

1696
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:44,969
needs she's not getting you know robbed

1697
01:34:42,539 --> 01:34:46,198
of something that needs to be that's

1698
01:34:44,969 --> 01:34:48,029
that's the thing that's where the future

1699
01:34:46,198 --> 01:34:49,888
is gonna be we're all gonna get cannabis

1700

1724
01:36:12,569 --> 01:36:17,859
a two-year wait

1725
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:21,639

01:36:55,599 --> 01:36:59,288
of power

1734
01:36:56,729 --> 01:37:02,738

1735
01:36:59,288 --> 01:37:03,939
that cost more you know and that's work

1736
01:37:02,738 --> 01:37:06,189
with some of those guys that have been

1737
01:37:03,939 --> 01:37:08,288
going through that whole deal that's sad

1738
01:37:06,189 --> 01:37:10,748
you know talking about how people have

1739
01:37:08,288 --> 01:37:12,759
been bent over backwards you know some

1740
01:37:10,748 --> 01:37:17,859
people had high hopes down there you

1741
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:19,480
know it's finally reality you know like

1742
01:37:17,859 --> 01:37:24,219
I said you don't push something that's

1743
01:37:19,479 --> 01:37:28,029
not natural you know and that those type

1744
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:31,960
of deals are gonna work and the Midwest

1745
01:37:28,029 --> 01:37:34,929
and on the East Coast where it's cold as

1746
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:36,819
I you know it's super cold you know

1747
01:37:34,929 --> 01:37:41,469
right now you can't grow much and

1748
01:37:36,819 --> 01:37:43,868
there's still a supply there and a huge

1749
01:37:41,469 --> 01:37:45,519
demand and so you got this little you

1750
01:37:43,868 --> 01:37:48,639
know warehouse could that can supply

1751
01:37:45,519 --> 01:37:50,980
enough that it's gonna make a good mint

1752
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:53,498
and it can keep the power on you know

1753
01:37:50,979 --> 01:37:56,888
but here I don't see the shit like down

1754
01:37:53,498 --> 01:37:58,238
on the desert working no the more reason

1755
01:37:56,889 --> 01:38:00,639
we need to be able to ship cannabis

1756
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:02,529
across state lines because there's been

1757
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:03,849
an avocado is over they're not trying to

1758
01:38:02,529 --> 01:38:06,248
grow spinach over there cuz it doesn't

1759
01:38:03,849 --> 01:38:08,349
grow Bo doesn't roll over jack roll

1760
01:38:06,248 --> 01:38:09,969
where it grows the best and you ship it

1761
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:12,699
to the rest of the country it's how

1762
01:38:09,969 --> 01:38:14,439
farming works like for some reason that

1763
01:38:12,698 --> 01:38:15,158
loop has been cut off I can't get it

1764
01:38:14,439 --> 01:38:17,049
back right now

1765
01:38:15,158 --> 01:38:19,509
certainly because it will ship that shit

1766
01:38:17,050 --> 01:38:21,519
these cousins always have it that's the

1767
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:24,699
thing you're never gonna stop that part

1768
01:38:21,519 --> 01:38:27,248
of it until you you know I hate to say

1769
01:38:24,698 --> 01:38:28,339
it but I don't know if the the current

1770
01:38:27,248 --> 01:38:31,250
person in

1771
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:34,340
office right now he kind of sees it he

1772
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:36,649
sees that oh you know they're gonna get

1773
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:39,170
it regardless you know they're gonna get

1774
01:38:36,649 --> 01:38:41,210
a ditch in is gonna be out there they're

1775
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:43,880
gonna get their product regardless and

1776
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:46,430
prohibition doesn't work you know

1777
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:48,890
regardless upon his emotion if he thinks

1778
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:53,900
he met you may sound stupid it makes you

1779
01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:55,940
sound stupid sometimes it does if you

1780
01:38:53,899 --> 01:38:57,589
know whatever his thoughts on what it

1781
01:38:55,939 --> 01:38:59,419
does to an individual don't really

1782
01:38:57,590 --> 01:39:01,190
matter it comes down to a business sense

1783
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:03,710
and California is making a lot of money

1784
01:39:01,189 --> 01:39:06,619
on cannabis and all California really is

1785
01:39:03,710 --> 01:39:08,869
is a renter in the United States right

1786
01:39:06,619 --> 01:39:11,390
in one of the states so eventually the

1787
01:39:08,869 --> 01:39:14,769
feds coming for its money you know and

1788
01:39:11,390 --> 01:39:18,560
organs money and Washington's money and

1789
01:39:14,770 --> 01:39:20,930
Colorado's money you know eventually

1790
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:22,490
that's how it's gonna go down and that's

1791
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:24,500
why we're doing this is they're getting

1792
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:25,939
their dry run on they're seeing one

1793
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:27,439
how's this working what's happened with

1794
01:39:25,939 --> 01:39:29,389
the farmers where's the money

1795
01:39:27,439 --> 01:39:32,750
oh it's fuckin California those

1796
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:34,880
cocksuckers they're sittin on it problem

1797
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:36,289
is there's no money in health and that's

1798
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:39,260
what's being held that oh there's no

1799
01:39:36,289 --> 01:39:41,029
money in hell they start teaching the

1800
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:43,310
endocannabinoids system people get help

1801
01:39:41,029 --> 01:39:46,189
yeah there's no there's no money in

1802
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:47,810
education or health because if you don't

1803
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:49,609
the reason they make money is cuz you

1804
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:51,110
get sick and they give you pills if you

1805
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:51,619
don't get sick and they can't give you

1806
01:39:51,109 --> 01:39:53,479
pills

1807
01:39:51,619 --> 01:39:55,819
it changes medicine back to before the

1808
01:39:53,479 --> 01:39:57,589
30s when that's how it was plant-based

1809
01:39:55,819 --> 01:39:59,359
medicine but that Jeff is the face of

1810
01:39:57,590 --> 01:40:01,819
medicine again and for people to make a

1811
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:03,529
lot of money run the government that's

1812
01:40:01,819 --> 01:40:05,299
holding you back right now you know so

1813
01:40:03,529 --> 01:40:09,109
even if the picture that does understand

1814
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:10,699
that what big fine it's petrochemical

1815
01:40:09,109 --> 01:40:13,399
it's not just Pharma

1816
01:40:10,699 --> 01:40:18,500
it's talk a plastic textile fucking fuel

1817
01:40:13,399 --> 01:40:21,469
a man we're talking you know the plant

1818
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:23,149
is gonna change the world eventually you

1819
01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:29,170
know eventually people will wake up to

1820
01:40:23,149 --> 01:40:33,159
this thing oh oh oh

1821

1823
01:40:34,510 --> 01:40:43,860

1824
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:43,859
this shit will click with people and

1825
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:52,500
[Laughter]

1826
01:40:47,189 --> 01:40:52,500
it's gonna take time I guess you know we

1827
01:40:57,659 --> 01:41:04,269

1828
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:06,670
uses him saying that in the Tesla cars

1829
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:09,850
but then he gets reamed for smoking you

1830
01:41:06,670 --> 01:41:12,039
joined Joe Rogan show yeah so you have

1831

1832
01:41:12,039 --> 01:41:15,550
him but he could have said how you

01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,949
motherfuckers yeah I smoked the joint

1834

1835
01:41:17,948 --> 01:41:21,549

1840
01:41:48,630 --> 01:41:56,170
work has gone up right Tesla stock price

1841
01:41:53,469 --> 01:41:59,140
Cano having a car I rock it in my theory

1842
01:41:56,170 --> 01:42:00,730
is a lot of their stuff in-house in this

1843
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:02,140
whole China thing's gonna fuck the car

1844
01:42:00,729 --> 01:42:03,459
industry because everything you know you

1845
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:05,650
want a pair of breaks it's gonna be the

1846
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:08,859
main turn but they do a lot of shit up

1847
01:42:05,649 --> 01:42:11,519
there in California there are up there

1848

and we're we're fucking NorCal there

1849
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:28,000
that's a whole nother state we should

1850
01:42:13,539 --> 01:42:29,859
get separate but no they that factory

1851
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,640
does everything in-house for the most

1852
01:42:29,859 --> 01:42:32,639
part yeah

1853
01:42:32,859 --> 01:42:42,229

01:43:50,539 --> 01:43:58,130
in place in Riverside County Cole there

1870
01:43:52,430 --> 01:44:00,440
is no logic we had an ad hoc which is

1871
01:43:58,130 --> 01:44:02,810
you know to to build like-minded people

1872
01:44:00,439 --> 01:44:05,509
come together and you know hash out what

1873
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:07,610
should have been talked about and they

1874
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:10,100
expunge that and said now or kick that

1875
01:44:07,609 --> 01:44:11,929
to the curb and so with everything at

1876
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:13,910
the county level yeah because it's

1877
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:15,710
unincorporated so either that either

1878
01:44:13,909 --> 01:44:18,529
they incorporate over there

1879
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:21,350
ananza or they keep getting screwed by

1880
01:44:18,529 --> 01:44:22,729
the county and the thing is is that you

01:46:23,729 --> 01:46:27,868
it in there they news in there so it

1922
01:46:25,590 --> 01:46:36,360
might occurred ya know correct naturally

1923
01:46:27,868 --> 01:46:38,639
all that arsenic yeah so water water is

1924
01:46:36,359 --> 01:46:40,679
key for people you know and that's a

1925
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:43,529
watershed so that's one thing that

1926
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:51,630
people should realize is they're still

1927
01:46:43,529 --> 01:46:53,778
and Tom could be your neighbor

1928
01:46:51,630 --> 01:46:58,128
Sammy watch come on

1929
01:46:53,779 --> 01:47:00,100
oh yeah you could turn it into the next

1930
01:46:58,128 --> 01:47:03,809
Swami you could grow the beard

1931
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:03,810
[Laughter]

1932
01:47:05,019 --> 01:47:22,208
country a country swarming yeah not too

1933
01:47:20,509 --> 01:47:25,849
shabby

1934
01:47:22,208 --> 01:47:27,318
but it's the regulation needs to change

1935
01:47:25,849 --> 01:47:29,929
because the Appalachian you know if

1936
01:47:27,319 --> 01:47:33,139
we're in somewhere down in San Diego

1937
01:47:29,929 --> 01:47:37,939
you say what the current regulations are

1938
01:47:33,139 --> 01:47:39,708
it's indoor and so it doesn't allow all

1939
01:47:37,939 --> 01:47:42,109
throughout the county they will not

1940
01:47:39,708 --> 01:47:45,259
allow any outdoor cultivation except for

1941
01:47:42,109 --> 01:47:47,539
your six or your 25 so if it's only

1942
01:47:45,259 --> 01:47:50,328
indoor then you guys can't create the

1943
01:47:47,538 --> 01:47:52,458
basis for Appalachia you can create the

1944
01:47:50,328 --> 01:47:54,438
framework for when you lose they can be

1945
01:47:52,458 --> 01:47:57,519
amazing I'm trying to tell you the

1946
01:47:54,439 --> 01:48:00,319
people there look at me like I'm crazy

1947
01:47:57,519 --> 01:48:05,838
other crops within the county well yeah

1948
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:07,819
there's grapes there's all the macula

1949
01:48:05,838 --> 01:48:11,649
has all types of Appalachians that are

1950
01:48:07,819 --> 01:48:11,649
through the avian in or whatever

1951
01:48:12,338 --> 01:48:18,828
American visitor ABA so fuck they call

1952
01:48:16,309 --> 01:48:20,929
these other sure in this state could say

1953
01:48:18,828 --> 01:48:22,878
no Appalachians are real cannabis

1954
01:48:20,929 --> 01:48:24,949
Appalachians are reeling you should list

1955
01:48:22,878 --> 01:48:31,548
well we'll just let up north do it and

1956
01:48:24,948 --> 01:48:34,009
then I'll get you hey science all from a

1957
01:48:31,548 --> 01:48:38,328
science up science scientists

1958
01:48:34,009 --> 01:48:41,930
yes you we want one it's only fair and

1959
01:48:38,328 --> 01:48:46,609
we want the the social equity to

1960
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:51,159
thank you we deserved it so you know

1961
01:48:46,609 --> 01:49:02,539
that's why I came down and visit woodsy

1962
01:48:51,159 --> 01:49:03,829
yes we we have many Wow oh yes there are

1963
01:49:02,539 --> 01:49:04,130
new neighbors so we got to get used to

1964
01:49:03,829 --> 01:49:07,309
it

1965
01:49:04,130 --> 01:49:10,369
the own property so it is what it is you

1966
01:49:07,310 --> 01:49:13,820
know it they started migrating in about

1967
01:49:10,369 --> 01:49:16,369
five years ago heavily and now bought a

1968
01:49:13,819 --> 01:49:19,069
good portion of the Appalachian and

1969
01:49:16,369 --> 01:49:20,809
they're there to stay is you know they

1970
01:49:19,069 --> 01:49:23,259
grow a good catalyst yeah that's the

1971
01:49:20,810 --> 01:49:25,730
problem is they don't know what good Kim

1972
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:27,170
listen you know they're all you they get

1973
01:49:25,729 --> 01:49:33,019
their hands on some clones and I

1974
01:49:27,170 --> 01:49:36,050
sprained the shit cars and trucks and

1975
01:49:33,020 --> 01:49:41,480
they know every year and it's driving

1976
01:49:36,050 --> 01:49:57,159
the hillbilly people crazy country folk

1977
01:49:41,479 --> 01:49:59,839
crazy out there enjoyed country folk

1978
01:49:57,159 --> 01:50:02,300
well we're all country folk out there

1979
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:03,949
you know and so these country people are

1980
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:05,690
like who are these people aren't they're

1981
01:50:03,949 --> 01:50:08,179
coming in and they're raiding you know

1982
01:50:05,689 --> 01:50:10,519
like and so they'll fight and then

1983
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:12,800
eventually you know what happened was is

1984
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:14,810
the you know the the big money finally

1985
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:17,090
came in last couple years and that's who

1986
01:50:14,810 --> 01:50:18,680
got the sheriff's route up and all the

1987
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:19,940
everybody else share out up there

1988
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:21,560
they're like we're investing in this

1989
01:50:19,939 --> 01:50:23,719
fucking shit so you guys better come out

1990
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:33,890
and crack down on these fuckers black

1991
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:36,110
market motherfuckers except for now you

1992
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:38,869
have this whole new culture here yes

1993
01:50:36,109 --> 01:50:40,579
these people look different but people

1994
01:50:38,869 --> 01:50:44,349
get alike understand there's there's

1995
01:50:40,579 --> 01:50:44,350
there's armors and they're hard workers

1996
01:50:45,970 --> 01:50:52,190
yes yes and they don't like that side so

1997
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,079
that makes it bad for the growers though

1998
01:50:52,189 --> 01:50:57,109
also because now you have that stigma

1999
01:50:54,079 --> 01:50:58,670
now you know oh you're you know rather

2000
01:50:57,109 --> 01:51:01,969
than looking upon you or you're bringing

2001
01:50:58,670 --> 01:51:03,859
like back in the early 70s 80s 90s it

2002
01:51:01,970 --> 01:51:06,260
was quiet money but it was the money

2003
01:51:03,859 --> 01:51:10,159
that kept the community going sure you

2004
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:12,579
know but nobody talked about it and now

2005
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:16,099
it's out and everybody's fucking face

2006
01:51:12,579 --> 01:51:19,000
hydro shops and fucking new halls going

2007
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:19,000
up and down the road

2008
01:51:25,539 --> 01:51:30,859
up and down that you know it's gotten

2009
01:51:28,069 --> 01:51:33,289
everybody stirred up and it's gotten you

2010
01:51:30,859 --> 01:51:37,130
know it's gotten it's gotten a lot of

2011
01:51:33,289 --> 01:51:39,289
people stirred up now but that's you

2012
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:42,590
know a part that the community needs to

2013
01:51:39,289 --> 01:51:44,750
learn how to accept and work with flow

2014
01:51:42,590 --> 01:51:46,480
with work with rather than work against

2015
01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:49,159
because these people are digging in

2016
01:51:46,479 --> 01:51:51,349
these are the same people wrote the back

2017
01:51:49,159 --> 01:51:55,789
of the US military with the Ho Chi Minh

2018
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:57,740
Trail DNA they will break these fucking

2019
01:51:55,789 --> 01:51:59,750
Riverside County Sheriff's and they will

2020
01:51:57,739 --> 01:52:02,719
break any people up there they're done

2021
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:04,850
it they're backed by the Chinese deep

2022
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:09,079
money and deep pockets people that

2023
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:10,940
realize no people who realize that the

2024
01:52:09,079 --> 01:52:13,159
Appalachian way before people like me

2025
01:52:10,939 --> 01:52:15,710
probably did and realize where do we put

2026
01:52:13,159 --> 01:52:18,139
that you know money buy land up there

2027
01:52:15,710 --> 01:52:19,210
put these farmer guys in you know let

2028
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:22,010
them do their thing

2029
01:52:19,210 --> 01:52:24,920
yeah exactly you know people who realize

2030
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:26,659
this shit way before others do and buy

2031
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:28,730
into this area kind of like the

2032
01:52:26,659 --> 01:52:30,380
Coachella thing a few years ago all this

2033
01:52:28,729 --> 01:52:33,409
fucking desert land all of a sudden

2034
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:35,569
turning into huge warehouses and once

2035
01:52:33,409 --> 01:52:37,489
was going for five thousand acre that's

2036
01:52:35,569 --> 01:52:40,759
now going for a hundred thousand an acre

2037
01:52:37,489 --> 01:52:45,099
shit like that you know you look into

2038
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:45,100
that and then you realize okay that's

2039
01:52:45,850 --> 01:52:49,610
there shit's fallen apart real quick I

2040
01:52:48,229 --> 01:52:52,069
was down there not too long ago and

2041
01:52:49,609 --> 01:52:57,319
there was a lot of industrial and

2042
01:52:52,069 --> 01:52:59,359
commercial Lots up for sale or you know

2043
01:52:57,319 --> 01:53:01,130
rent whatever but people had pulled out

2044
01:52:59,359 --> 01:53:03,170
I know a lot of companies that were

2045
01:53:01,130 --> 01:53:05,619
doing the same thing you're doing that

2046
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:09,460
pulled up shop and went up two or

2047
01:53:05,619 --> 01:53:12,550
and shut down fired everybody you know

2048
01:53:09,460 --> 01:53:17,819
and bounced out of that little area and

2049
01:53:12,550 --> 01:53:17,820
out of that situation you know so that's

2050
01:53:17,909 --> 01:53:22,569
you know eventually that'll come back to

2051
01:53:20,619 --> 01:53:24,220
the table but I think you know in the

2052
01:53:22,569 --> 01:53:25,929
next several especially with this new

2053
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:28,390
thing that's going on with the market

2054
01:53:25,930 --> 01:53:30,070
and how things will happen with this I

2055
01:53:28,390 --> 01:53:33,280
think that's really gonna go on the

2056
01:53:30,069 --> 01:53:34,779
shelf for a while it's gonna be on the

2057
01:53:33,279 --> 01:53:40,869
show from yeah there's a lot of it I

2058
01:53:34,779 --> 01:53:43,179
mean it's their time to and they're

2059
01:53:40,869 --> 01:53:44,890
starting to already yeah because like

2060
01:53:43,180 --> 01:53:47,740
you said earlier people aren't

2061
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:48,760
understanding like it's a huge market

2062
01:53:47,739 --> 01:53:51,429
and it's going to be a huge market

2063
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:54,340
place's it's gonna continue to be but

2064
01:53:51,430 --> 01:53:55,840
they're they don't understand how to do

2065
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:57,310
it yet or like you said it like

2066
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:59,319
different strains work different places

2067
01:53:57,310 --> 01:54:01,240
and different things so it's like people

2068
01:53:59,319 --> 01:54:03,009
are buying spending a lot of money on

2069
01:54:01,239 --> 01:54:04,329
seeds and they're just throwing it out

2070
01:54:03,010 --> 01:54:07,090
there but they're not throwing them in

2071
01:54:04,329 --> 01:54:08,619
the right place yep so it's it's

2072
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:09,970
problematic because it's there's a huge

2073
01:54:08,619 --> 01:54:13,029
learning curve on that and what you're

2074
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:16,329
talking about on top of and that's where

2075
01:54:13,029 --> 01:54:18,189
it all starts and that's you know that's

2076
01:54:16,329 --> 01:54:20,109
where it all starts is with the farmer

2077
01:54:18,189 --> 01:54:23,649
because what we produce is what you

2078
01:54:20,109 --> 01:54:25,779
extract or you know what so there's so

2079
01:54:23,649 --> 01:54:28,659

and you'll do it and do your thing you

2126
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:56,619
know that's important I think and a lot

2127
01:56:53,829 --> 01:56:58,989
of people have and are in good places

2128
01:56:56,619 --> 01:57:00,399
and aren't set up you know it's license

2129
01:56:58,989 --> 01:57:02,619
and are doing their thing and making

2130
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:04,779
money but you know it seems like this

2131
01:57:02,619 --> 01:57:08,439
business is always changing and so you

2132
01:57:04,779 --> 01:57:10,119
know what you're doing now is that gonna

2133
01:57:08,439 --> 01:57:11,979
be working in five years look at what

2134
01:57:10,119 --> 01:57:14,319
happened to you know med man like it

2135
01:57:11,979 --> 01:57:15,869
what happened to canopy you know

2136
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:22,679
throwing it till

2137
01:57:15,869 --> 01:57:25,500
all these companies that was everybody I

2138
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:27,270
think so I think I think it's not

2139
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:29,970
necessary craft growers I think somebody

2140
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:31,110
if you look into who the brands kinda re

2141
01:57:29,970 --> 01:57:32,340
if you look at somebody like you were

2142
01:57:31,109 --> 01:57:36,479
mentioning Frenchie somebody like that

2143
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:38,340
for instance he's built uh he's got a

2144
01:57:36,479 --> 01:57:41,489
good brand he's got a good product he's

2145
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:44,250
found his niche but he's he's he's

2146
01:57:41,489 --> 01:57:47,309
culture he's entertaining he's Swami

2147
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:49,710
there these are people that are exactly

2148
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:51,240
they have you know they have a niche to

2149
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:53,909
them a certain something that people are

2150
01:57:51,239 --> 01:57:55,920
interested drawn to and so those are the

2151
01:57:53,909 --> 01:57:58,229
guys who will probably survive in the

2152
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:01,730
end you know and and and the guys who

2153
01:57:58,229 --> 01:58:04,859
have the money who do it as a hobby

2154
01:58:01,729 --> 01:58:07,739
create the cultivars and create the

2155
01:58:04,859 --> 01:58:10,079
appellations with the cultivars and and

2156
01:58:07,739 --> 01:58:11,760
do it as a passion will be the dudes

2157
01:58:10,079 --> 01:58:14,869
that will be remembered it won't be the

2158
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:18,270
guy with fucking four billion dollars

2159
01:58:14,869 --> 01:58:21,420
who is he's forgot about now now fired

2160
01:58:18,270 --> 01:58:25,350
like a guy strikes or a Volvo of

2161
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:29,369
cannabis yeah I think I think I think I

2162
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:32,579
think I think yeah because corporate

2163
01:58:29,369 --> 01:58:35,250
there's no killing that no but I think

2164
01:58:32,579 --> 01:58:37,920
we are the last industry as small

2165
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:42,510
farmers and you know craft guys and that

2166
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:47,310
have this passion that can kind of niche

2167
01:58:42,510 --> 01:58:49,380
out something special that awakens

2168
01:58:47,310 --> 01:58:51,960
people and causes consciousness and

2169
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:54,949
causes people to realize all fuck maybe

2170
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:58,680
the way I'm living and I was not

2171
01:58:54,949 --> 01:59:02,720
regenitive and in a in a manner that I'm

2172
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:05,280
just taking advantage of everything and

2173
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:06,990
we and we caused something to say oh

2174
01:59:05,279 --> 01:59:09,509
well the farming that we're doing back

2175
01:59:06,989 --> 01:59:11,159
east isn't healthy you know and the food

2176
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:12,869
that we're eating isn't healthy and the

2177
01:59:11,159 --> 01:59:15,170
way we're going about it is it healthy

2178
01:59:12,869 --> 01:59:17,970
for the rest of the world and it's not

2179
01:59:15,170 --> 01:59:19,649
you know hopefully but that's the last

2180
01:59:17,970 --> 01:59:21,810
product and that's the last industry

2181
01:59:19,649 --> 01:59:23,849
that'll do it you know it's not gonna be

2182
01:59:21,810 --> 01:59:25,710
some electronic bullshit that all Sun

2183
01:59:23,850 --> 01:59:26,789
causes consciousness and people are like

2184
01:59:25,710 --> 01:59:29,909
oh

2185
01:59:26,789 --> 01:59:34,019
when yes it'll be a plant and then most

2186
01:59:29,909 --> 01:59:42,960
likely that plan yeah some about

2187
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:45,180
economics there's something in an area

2188
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:48,390
where you know especially up in that

2189
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:51,329
region up there it's very opened so at

2190
01:59:48,390 --> 01:59:58,430
night you can see all the the galaxies I

2191
01:59:51,329 --> 02:00:00,989
mean you see all the colonies I mean I

2192
01:59:58,430 --> 02:00:05,420
brought I brought a half outside no

2193
02:00:00,989 --> 02:00:05,420
other lights and sums up to Alaska

2194
02:00:08,149 --> 02:00:14,969
that's important ya know it's important

2195
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:15,720
to be and the plant should be a part of

2196
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:17,970
that too

2197
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:19,230
you know you should be taking that in

2198
02:00:17,970 --> 02:00:21,000
and that's what I'm talking about

2199
02:00:19,229 --> 02:00:23,669
cousin you know that people start

2200
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:26,699
realizing the food clothes you know the

2201
02:00:23,670 --> 02:00:30,949
stuff that they're putting on themselves

2202
02:00:26,699 --> 02:00:34,800
and in themselves is having an impact

2203
02:00:30,949 --> 02:00:45,029
big time all over the world and all over

2204
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:47,300
themselves work and like work clothing

2205
02:00:45,029 --> 02:00:50,969
Oh work clothing

2206
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:51,810
basic thing that's great yeah that's

2207
02:00:50,970 --> 02:00:54,720
awesome

2208
02:00:51,810 --> 02:00:56,070
you make jeans well that's what leave

2209
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:58,829
are used to that's where they first

2210
02:00:56,069 --> 02:01:00,059
started out with the ham and then went

2211
02:00:58,829 --> 02:01:03,899
the cotton so you can make more money

2212
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:21,900
because you got ones were out hemp ones

2213
02:01:03,899 --> 02:01:24,989
did no that's a whole nother debate

2214
02:01:21,899 --> 02:01:27,899
Washington's him when he was talking

2215
02:01:24,989 --> 02:01:30,329
about plant the Indian hemp because at

2216
02:01:27,899 --> 02:01:31,920
the time everybody knew Indian hemp was

2217
02:01:30,329 --> 02:01:35,880
the hemp that got you stoned

2218
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:38,579
it wasn't the pimp 200 years prior to

2219
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:40,109
even Washington hemp was being grown in

2220
02:01:38,579 --> 02:01:43,019
the colonies

2221
02:01:40,109 --> 02:01:46,849
European hemp hemp for fiber and sails

2222
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:50,870
for oil and things like that

2223
02:01:46,850 --> 02:01:53,640
yeah they pay their taxes with him

2224
02:01:50,869 --> 02:01:56,010
compared to during wartime you had that

2225
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:57,960
you had the girls yeah you and you could

2226
02:01:56,010 --> 02:02:00,480
pay your taxes with it at one time but

2227
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:09,600
he was the guy right now Indian have

2228
02:02:00,479 --> 02:02:12,959
this shit's good stuff it's for rope at

2229
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:13,770
that time Indian hemp was the hemp that

2230
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:21,329
was medicine

2231
02:02:13,770 --> 02:02:23,520
it wasn't European hem right in front of

2232
02:02:21,329 --> 02:02:25,199
our face the history's right there I

2233
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:27,930
mean you can look it up and it's like

2234
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:30,569
they're the guys quoting it you know and

2235
02:02:27,930 --> 02:02:35,070
he's panicking he writes a deal do as

2236
02:02:30,569 --> 02:02:38,159
was I think it's you know the guy who

2237
02:02:35,069 --> 02:02:40,469
runs is his Foreman of his garden he's

2238
02:02:38,159 --> 02:02:42,420
panicking where those seeds the seeds

2239
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:44,730
need to be planted make sure those

2240
02:02:42,420 --> 02:02:55,859
Indian hemp seeds are planted make sure

2241
02:02:44,729 --> 02:02:58,079
it's the Indians later it's like no yeah

2242
02:02:55,859 --> 02:03:00,329
well that's the fight you know that's

2243
02:02:58,079 --> 02:03:03,689
supposedly the father of the revolution

2244
02:03:00,329 --> 02:03:05,189
you know that's wire like there's a lot

2245
02:03:03,689 --> 02:03:07,979
of crazy here so there's a guy who was

2246
02:03:05,189 --> 02:03:10,349
it crisp and and I think a guy who goes

2247
02:03:07,979 --> 02:03:13,589
into a lot of like the biblical history

2248
02:03:10,350 --> 02:03:17,460
and a lot of like like you know deep

2249
02:03:13,590 --> 02:03:19,260
into the history of the plant yeah and

2250
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:21,680
you'll find that a lot of you know the

2251
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:24,720
Revolutionary dudes we're you know

2252
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:27,350
messing with some type of a she should

2253
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:33,380
be some type of cannabis you know

2254
02:03:27,350 --> 02:03:36,390
especially the writers and people like

2255
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:40,529
read she says it's an extruder you about

2256
02:03:36,390 --> 02:03:44,070
a hatch every morning really doesn't

2257
02:03:40,529 --> 02:03:46,979
like but like all of it like a bomb I

2258
02:03:44,069 --> 02:03:48,299
was it seemed like it would kill the

2259
02:03:46,979 --> 02:03:55,099
average human being

2260
02:03:48,300 --> 02:04:06,150
his presence tell me about good for you

2261
02:03:55,100 --> 02:04:08,430
like a Clif Bar size right yeah that's

2262
02:04:06,149 --> 02:04:10,799
how I met Peter it was through that hole

2263
02:04:08,430 --> 02:04:14,220
yeah I was I was interviewing a friend

2264
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:18,300
she was screaming he was like his face

2265
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:20,400
he was like spitting in his face and I

2266
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:32,670
was on mushrooms and it was a it was a

2267
02:04:20,399 --> 02:04:34,469
Desert Hot Springs end of August I kept

2268
02:04:32,670 --> 02:04:37,800
going inside because it was like

2269
02:04:34,470 --> 02:04:39,750
ice-cold cool and then you come and then

2270
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:42,090
I get cold and I come back outside and I

2271
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:43,979
get like super hot yeah I kept having to

2272
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:46,770
go back back you

2273
02:04:43,979 --> 02:04:49,619
but even medium units we were just going

2274
02:04:46,770 --> 02:04:54,150
at it about his toes about three through

2275
02:04:49,619 --> 02:04:55,739
parallel parallel yeah that screamin

2276
02:04:54,149 --> 02:04:56,629
nose good conversation you know he's

2277
02:04:55,739 --> 02:04:59,579
French

2278
02:04:56,630 --> 02:05:01,680
they were sitting like where these two

2279
02:04:59,579 --> 02:05:07,039
are and I was sitting here in base

2280
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:07,039
enough now

2281
02:05:09,859 --> 02:05:15,469
he possibly shat on their appellation

2282
02:05:13,859 --> 02:05:18,210
because nobody's ever heard of it

2283
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:21,060
he's like nobody knows about you so you

2284
02:05:18,210 --> 02:05:22,739
must be Mary who are you basically you

2285
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:26,610
don't have no genetics and I was like I

2286
02:05:22,739 --> 02:05:28,469
agree 100% like but that's what I'm here

2287
02:05:26,609 --> 02:05:34,199
that's what I'm trying you know like

2288
02:05:28,470 --> 02:05:35,909
somebody's got it yeah I know totally

2289
02:05:34,199 --> 02:05:37,170
like where he's coming from and that's

2290
02:05:35,909 --> 02:05:41,489
what I said hey buddy you got the

2291
02:05:37,170 --> 02:05:47,369
culture but I got the science does go

2292
02:05:41,489 --> 02:05:49,889
way back it's not you don't have to be

2293
02:05:47,369 --> 02:05:51,779
here you know who's over you know

2294
02:05:49,890 --> 02:05:53,700
there's a lot of culture up there that's

2295
02:05:51,779 --> 02:05:56,279
come out of the closet because they've

2296
02:05:53,699 --> 02:05:57,840
had to it's a survival technique you

2297
02:05:56,279 --> 02:06:05,069
know I got to start building a brand I

2298
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:07,350
got to start getting early sixties to

2299
02:06:05,069 --> 02:06:11,210
probably fuck it's not the Avenger

2300
02:06:07,350 --> 02:06:11,210
because it's a part of it part of

2301
02:06:11,869 --> 02:06:15,930
Appalachian I know I'm just talking

2302
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:17,340
about bringing something I'm not I'm

2303
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:18,510
just trying to bring attention to

2304
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:21,000
something that's already there I'm not

2305
02:06:18,510 --> 02:06:23,940
trying to create anything yeah bring the

2306
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:27,390
oil is that yeah thanks true oh that's

2307
02:06:23,939 --> 02:06:28,979
good you know that but you know and

2308
02:06:27,390 --> 02:06:31,740
seeing that the way I can do it is

2309
02:06:28,979 --> 02:06:35,309
through the Appalachian system yeah you

2310
02:06:31,739 --> 02:06:37,229
know yeah I don't that because I see it

2311
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:39,060
and that's what's gonna do it's a little

2312
02:06:37,229 --> 02:06:42,619
area you know there's a lot of Aryan

2313
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:45,620
salmonidae know and and San Diego

2314
02:06:42,619 --> 02:06:45,619
Riverside

2315
02:06:46,559 --> 02:06:52,650
so anytime I love that is something that

2316
02:06:50,819 --> 02:06:57,479
you have opportunity to get back in the

2317
02:06:52,649 --> 02:06:58,799
dry part yeah no I totally agree no see

2318
02:06:57,479 --> 02:07:00,029
on the dry farm there's some areas you

2319
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:02,550
couldn't drive farm up there though

2320
02:07:00,029 --> 02:07:04,229
but there's a lot areas there's also

2321
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:07,260
some so the Appalachian would encompass

2322
02:07:04,229 --> 02:07:09,718
also San Diego if I was to you know if

2323
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:13,020
it was up to me yeah it would encompass

2324
02:07:09,719 --> 02:07:15,719
a little bit of San Diego County North

2325
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:19,530
County there and probably a little bit

2326
02:07:15,719 --> 02:07:21,630
of South County salmonidae yeah exactly

2327
02:07:19,529 --> 02:07:29,460
it's all that high country it's all that

2328
02:07:21,630 --> 02:07:31,429
you know that is weighted or that yeah

2329
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:33,989
yeah

2330
02:07:31,429 --> 02:07:35,550
Morocco anything along the 33rd parallel

2331
02:07:33,988 --> 02:07:39,468
all that stuff that's through the

2332
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:42,480
Mediterranean all that Moroccan Lebanon

2333
02:07:39,469 --> 02:07:44,010
Golan Heights all the way to New Year's

2334
02:07:42,479 --> 02:07:48,269
to create something that you can throw

2335
02:07:44,010 --> 02:07:50,820
right back in Friday's not about that

2336
02:07:48,270 --> 02:07:53,280
it's about just bringing light I think

2337
02:07:50,819 --> 02:07:55,139
he sees it I think now I think people

2338
02:07:53,279 --> 02:07:57,599
are starting to see it like when I

2339
02:07:55,139 --> 02:08:00,420
mention it you can bring it up I mean

2340
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:03,599
you can research you can google it it's

2341
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:05,670
called a Mediterranean biome and it and

2342
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:07,800
there's only goes along the third is

2343
02:08:05,670 --> 02:08:10,230
basically like the United States would

2344
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:12,960
you find a matter of Terry nowhere else

2345
02:08:10,229 --> 02:08:15,718
except on the west coast it goes up a

2346
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:18,960
little bit to Central some of northern

2347
02:08:15,719 --> 02:08:22,469
some of those areas but the hub of it

2348
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:24,359
would be more subtle well yeah well the

2349
02:08:22,469 --> 02:08:37,649
Temecula Valley's producing some of the

2350
02:08:24,359 --> 02:08:40,469
a lot of people

2351
02:08:37,649 --> 02:08:42,960
most people like all this fucking guys

2352
02:08:40,469 --> 02:08:45,000
yeah and like this look at the fucking

2353
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:46,618
science of it you know follow the pin

2354
02:08:45,000 --> 02:09:05,488
you know follow the history follow the

2355
02:08:46,618 --> 02:09:07,259
culture like it to give me know when you

2356
02:09:05,488 --> 02:09:08,549
do look at it there's other places

2357
02:09:07,260 --> 02:09:10,650
there's a lot of play you know there's

2358
02:09:08,550 --> 02:09:12,510
some but then when you still really

2359
02:09:10,649 --> 02:09:14,399
start opening it up and you say okay

2360
02:09:12,510 --> 02:09:16,530
where this where did the sativas work

2361
02:09:14,399 --> 02:09:18,868
because that's some of your in because

2362
02:09:16,529 --> 02:09:21,750
you know and and and so and then you

2363
02:09:18,868 --> 02:09:23,729
start going into metric turbid yeah and

2364
02:09:21,750 --> 02:09:26,039
then you start exactly some of the mechs

2365
02:09:23,729 --> 02:09:27,689
you know Mexico some of these different

2366
02:09:26,039 --> 02:09:29,069
you know regions to where you can

2367
02:09:27,689 --> 02:09:31,500
produce some fire

2368
02:09:29,069 --> 02:09:34,408
Stephen different growing regions will

2369
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:35,698
you find in the high country probably

2370
02:09:34,408 --> 02:09:38,368
there's many different microclimates

2371
02:09:35,698 --> 02:09:40,500
maybe many different microclimates and

2372
02:09:38,368 --> 02:09:42,509
many different soils and different you

2373
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:47,189
know there's a couple different aquifers

2374
02:09:42,510 --> 02:09:49,560
and the ABA yeah exactly so within that

2375
02:09:47,189 --> 02:09:51,839
let's say like how the whole the the

2376
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:53,670
whole Mendo projects going is there's

2377
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:55,560
several different areas up in that

2378
02:09:53,670 --> 02:09:57,199
appellation and the same thing that's

2379
02:09:55,560 --> 02:10:00,750
why I was saying it's probably gonna

2380
02:09:57,198 --> 02:10:03,029
eventually it would be multiple counties

2381
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:05,039
it wouldn't just be the and valley

2382
02:10:03,029 --> 02:10:07,649
you know maybe starting out the ends of

2383
02:10:05,039 --> 02:10:12,269
valleys such as how Temecula does in

2384
02:10:07,649 --> 02:10:13,939
these oh and it's spreading actually

2385
02:10:12,270 --> 02:10:18,000
people that are working on this

2386
02:10:13,939 --> 02:10:20,759
particular climate elsewhere in other

2387
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,560
counties that you know no I don't think

2388
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:24,630
so I don't think there is anybody

2389
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:27,690
because I mean there there's really not

2390
02:10:24,630 --> 02:10:31,489
a lot of people reaching out in SoCal to

2391
02:10:27,689 --> 02:10:34,529
do that so there may be a handful if

2392
02:10:31,488 --> 02:10:36,419
some work work during the day too cuz

2393
02:10:34,529 --> 02:10:39,210
it's all about gathering data and

2394
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:40,710
nothing but that do in order to create

2395
02:10:39,210 --> 02:10:42,599
your organization that well that's just

2396
02:10:40,710 --> 02:10:46,670
work that has to start at some point

2397
02:10:42,599 --> 02:10:46,670
this farmers coming together yeah

2398
02:10:46,939 --> 02:10:50,789
sharing information chain hey this is

2399
02:10:49,529 --> 02:10:52,979
what's working for me over here

2400
02:10:50,789 --> 02:10:57,029
the only way you do it is go you're

2401
02:10:52,979 --> 02:10:59,519
either dead or you try which was like

2402
02:10:57,029 --> 02:11:05,880
five robots that came together as one

2403
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:07,470
giant robot our bar up in Occidental you

2404
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:08,940
walk in and every single person there's

2405
02:11:07,470 --> 02:11:10,980
a cultivator and you know I used to kind

2406
02:11:08,939 --> 02:11:12,509
of keep to yourself now if you have an

2407
02:11:10,979 --> 02:11:14,939
issue you ask a question you need to

2408
02:11:12,510 --> 02:11:16,980
answer right now and it's coming

2409
02:11:14,939 --> 02:11:17,969
exponentially faster now because we're

2410
02:11:16,979 --> 02:11:20,279
out in the open and we're allowed to

2411
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:22,260
share information and it's okay to

2412
02:11:20,279 --> 02:11:24,899
finally grow cannabis up there you know

2413
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:28,500
I got screwed from the trees that's the

2414
02:11:24,899 --> 02:11:30,359
biggest industry information you know

2415
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:32,520
sharing information and now we're coming

2416
02:11:30,359 --> 02:11:34,799
in that stage to where IPS are so

2417
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:36,420
important well ironically then but then

2418
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:45,750
people get into IP that all of a sudden

2419
02:11:36,420 --> 02:11:46,739
they go I see it as either either you

2420
02:11:45,750 --> 02:11:48,750
got it or you don't

2421
02:11:46,739 --> 02:11:51,000
and then that's it life either you got

2422
02:11:48,750 --> 02:11:52,800
it or you don't you know and you can

2423
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:54,659
fake it all you want and you can have

2424
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:57,060
all the money in the world than you want

2425
02:11:54,659 --> 02:11:58,920
but either you got it or you don't you

2426
02:11:57,060 --> 02:12:02,580
know and that comes with cannabis and

2427
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:05,670
that's gonna come with having an IP that

2428
02:12:02,579 --> 02:12:08,220
somebody in a product that goes along

2429
02:12:05,670 --> 02:12:10,020
with that that somebody wants but you

2430
02:12:08,220 --> 02:12:12,659
know that's so true and that's true with

2431
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:14,490
genetics once once the genetics are on

2432
02:12:12,659 --> 02:12:16,319
the market they can't be patented anyway

2433
02:12:14,489 --> 02:12:20,039
I mean once and people put their clones

2434
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:23,759
out and those clones can no longer be

2435
02:12:20,039 --> 02:12:27,239
patented but but so but whatever someone

2436
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:30,150
can now that's right now future who

2437
02:12:27,239 --> 02:12:34,139
knows how that's all going to change the

2438
02:12:30,149 --> 02:12:36,409
law you know look at corn there Zoe I

2439
02:12:34,140 --> 02:12:39,360
mean look at these seeds that are

2440
02:12:36,409 --> 02:12:41,849
patented you've got to go to somebody

2441
02:12:39,359 --> 02:12:43,649
and you got to sign a contract won't get

2442
02:12:41,850 --> 02:12:45,420
any patents for all this stuff in the

2443
02:12:43,649 --> 02:12:48,119
patents may be broad and we'll see what

2444
02:12:45,420 --> 02:12:50,970
happens in court anyway but having the

2445
02:12:48,119 --> 02:12:52,800
appellation just that separates yeah

2446
02:12:50,970 --> 02:12:54,329
that separate that gets you away from

2447
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:56,039
all that mulching because that's what's

2448
02:12:54,329 --> 02:12:59,069
gonna happen to those hemp growers and

2449
02:12:56,039 --> 02:12:59,720
Midwest that are you know Kentucky you

2450
02:12:59,069 --> 02:13:01,340
know what

2451
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:05,750
Jinyan those dudes that are doing money

2452
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:07,850
like my hemp impregnating to be - a

2453
02:13:05,750 --> 02:13:09,979
because their God Mon center Mon

2454
02:13:07,850 --> 02:13:12,140
syndrome seriously just dissolved away

2455
02:13:09,979 --> 02:13:20,899
you know it's gonna be somebody else I

2456
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:23,630
will come a little organic compound see

2457
02:13:20,899 --> 02:13:26,989
that's where that's where the expression

2458
02:13:23,630 --> 02:13:30,470
of the soil and the cultivar and that

2459
02:13:26,989 --> 02:13:32,059
area is going to expect was nuts

2460
02:13:30,470 --> 02:13:33,650
so actually one of the most interesting

2461
02:13:32,060 --> 02:13:37,430
things she would this one was talking

2462
02:13:33,649 --> 02:13:40,759
about was that wine growers are noticing

2463
02:13:37,430 --> 02:13:42,500
when they test their wine new terpenes

2464
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:45,890
appearing in their wine that had never

2465
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:48,140
been there and like if you guys at

2466
02:13:45,890 --> 02:13:52,910
Sonoma growing down the street being

2467
02:13:48,140 --> 02:13:56,300
like sorry dude that's better than us

2468
02:13:52,909 --> 02:13:59,329
getting equal twenty one thing is that

2469
02:13:56,300 --> 02:14:02,480
whole industry so fucking poison over

2470
02:13:59,329 --> 02:14:04,340
the years was they need the cannabis but

2471
02:14:02,479 --> 02:14:15,649
but they're ready to see if people like

2472
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:17,090
that or like a separate farmer just

2473
02:14:15,649 --> 02:14:18,859
decides to throw it easy like you know

2474
02:14:17,090 --> 02:14:20,390
what I'm just gonna fuck him throw a few

2475
02:14:18,859 --> 02:14:22,189
males on the edge of my fucking field

2476
02:14:20,390 --> 02:14:23,450
here oh it's coming let's fucking go

2477
02:14:22,189 --> 02:14:26,589
because then they'll just yeah that's

2478
02:14:23,449 --> 02:14:29,359
what I do because a lot of people are

2479
02:14:26,590 --> 02:14:33,829
you know the cannabis growers and now

2480
02:14:29,359 --> 02:14:35,420
that I'm on the 0.3 side if they if if I

2481
02:14:33,829 --> 02:14:37,789
were the government and I were watching

2482
02:14:35,420 --> 02:14:44,630
this right now I would oh they are I

2483
02:14:37,789 --> 02:14:47,000
would throw out the male plants talk to

2484
02:14:44,630 --> 02:14:48,619
the commissioner in Riverside County and

2485
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,729
kind of discuss like hey what do you

2486
02:14:48,619 --> 02:14:51,500
guys think about that would be my

2487
02:14:49,729 --> 02:14:55,039
sportsman strategy what's a moratorium

2488
02:14:51,500 --> 02:14:58,479
on half in Sonoma County additional does

2489
02:14:55,039 --> 02:14:58,479
it there that's what they're planning

2490
02:14:58,779 --> 02:15:03,239
especially with the Asian

2491
02:15:00,989 --> 02:15:07,079
good luck everyone well they're all

2492
02:15:03,239 --> 02:15:09,029
outdoor water catcher so and so that's

2493
02:15:07,079 --> 02:15:10,649
what they're hoping is like Oh we'll

2494
02:15:09,029 --> 02:15:12,439
just fucking hopefully these hemp

2495
02:15:10,649 --> 02:15:14,969
brokers I've already talked to them and

2496
02:15:12,439 --> 02:15:16,859
see that's the thing is I'm not gonna be

2497
02:15:14,970 --> 02:15:18,789
I'm gonna do a little bit of breeding

2498
02:15:16,859 --> 02:15:23,500
but I'm not gonna be partying with Paul

2499
02:15:18,789 --> 02:15:23,500
[Laughter]

2500
02:15:41,130 --> 02:15:44,229
[Music]

2501
02:15:47,359 --> 02:15:55,219
knew that you're doing or the weather

2502
02:15:50,399 --> 02:15:57,629
sucks but that's what they're hoping is

2503
02:15:55,220 --> 02:15:59,670
pollinate those dudes that are just

2504
02:15:57,630 --> 02:16:02,489
illegally growing shit out there just

2505
02:15:59,670 --> 02:16:05,940
yeah they're just like fuck we hope that

2506
02:16:02,489 --> 02:16:11,789
you pollinate everything now like that

2507
02:16:05,939 --> 02:16:14,609
but I did somebody's gonna buy your

2508
02:16:11,789 --> 02:16:16,380
seeds all guarantee to be feminized no I

2509
02:16:14,609 --> 02:16:17,849
have some stock that I'm doing from

2510
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:20,250
guaranteed and then I have some other

2511
02:16:17,850 --> 02:16:25,530
stuff but I'll go out yeah you're right

2512
02:16:20,250 --> 02:16:29,550
around that's all new hurdles I've never

2513
02:16:25,529 --> 02:16:32,100
done that much and you know yeah you

2514
02:16:29,550 --> 02:16:34,050
know I've done decent amount but never

2515
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:36,180
you know and that's gonna be a whole new

2516
02:16:34,050 --> 02:16:39,029
way of harvesting and and what's gonna

2517
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:40,950
work what's gonna be you it's got to

2518
02:16:39,030 --> 02:16:42,841
come down to dollar and I don't want it

2519
02:16:40,950 --> 02:16:44,430
to ever really come down to that but

2520
02:16:42,841 --> 02:16:47,760
that's gonna come down to where you know

2521
02:16:44,430 --> 02:16:50,341
can I afford to have flour hand trimmed

2522
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:55,319
when I'm only getting yeah you know an X

2523
02:16:50,341 --> 02:16:57,329
amount for it yeah yeah just like you

2524
02:16:55,319 --> 02:16:59,909
know that you know we'll see

2525
02:16:57,329 --> 02:17:02,039
you know if I'm drawing it up and I'm

2526
02:16:59,909 --> 02:17:03,421
getting X amount for it then yeah I got

2527
02:17:02,040 --> 02:17:06,990
a market for it that's the big thing

2528
02:17:03,421 --> 02:17:10,110
what I'm realizing is is where is your

2529
02:17:06,989 --> 02:17:11,459
market you know where is where where is

2530
02:17:10,110 --> 02:17:13,739
your market and then

2531
02:17:11,459 --> 02:17:17,549
did you find you or do you find it you

2532
02:17:13,738 --> 02:17:19,948
have to find it yeah out there Carmen

2533
02:17:17,549 --> 02:17:27,478
I'm gonna find you that's the biggest

2534
02:17:19,949 --> 02:17:37,920
problem with farming you gotta go do

2535
02:17:27,478 --> 02:17:39,869
something with that now the problem with

2536
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:42,779
a lot you know this whole industry got

2537
02:17:39,870 --> 02:17:44,880
so broken in so many ways there's so

2538
02:17:42,779 --> 02:17:47,159
many people get me gimme gimme

2539
02:17:44,879 --> 02:17:49,619
I got you know the fingers are out

2540
02:17:47,159 --> 02:17:52,978
everybody you know and in the end it

2541
02:17:49,620 --> 02:17:55,500
there's no industry without flour so you

2542
02:17:52,978 --> 02:17:57,448
gotta respect your farmer because if he

2543
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:59,459
can't produce then what the fuck do you

2544
02:17:57,449 --> 02:18:01,559
have in the end whether you're a lawyer

2545
02:17:59,459 --> 02:18:03,898
whether you're whether you're a law

2546
02:18:01,558 --> 02:18:06,079
maker what laws are you gonna make the

2547
02:18:03,898 --> 02:18:09,448
mutant people can't pay your their taxes

2548
02:18:06,079 --> 02:18:11,039
you know in the end like why'd you make

2549
02:18:09,449 --> 02:18:15,449
laws that people aren't breaking them

2550
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:16,830
well that's another thing but that's the

2551
02:18:15,449 --> 02:18:19,469
thing is a lot of people don't realize

2552
02:18:16,829 --> 02:18:21,299
like you know these products in the end

2553
02:18:19,468 --> 02:18:23,579
they come from a farmer and they come

2554
02:18:21,299 --> 02:18:26,429
from a farm and you know there's a

2555
02:18:23,579 --> 02:18:28,709
there's a life behind that that's like

2556
02:18:26,429 --> 02:18:32,129
what you're sort of things like seed a

2557
02:18:28,709 --> 02:18:34,768
shelf is like sort of that's a I mean a

2558
02:18:32,129 --> 02:18:37,259
performer or a grow up business that's a

2559
02:18:34,769 --> 02:18:40,318
huge deal - oh yeah because if you're

2560
02:18:37,260 --> 02:18:42,689
putting product out like this no no you

2561
02:18:40,318 --> 02:18:44,579
can actually do from here to here and in

2562
02:18:42,689 --> 02:18:46,769
house you know that's the thing is

2563
02:18:44,579 --> 02:18:48,959
you're not outsourcing we do all that

2564
02:18:46,769 --> 02:18:53,099
in-house and what's nuts now is from

2565
02:18:48,959 --> 02:18:55,799
clone to out the distro microphone yeah

2566
02:18:53,099 --> 02:18:58,318
from clone out to distro it gets tagged

2567
02:18:55,799 --> 02:19:00,808
eleven times through metric in and out

2568
02:18:58,318 --> 02:19:02,549
of the buzzer system 11 times it's nuts

2569
02:19:00,808 --> 02:19:05,148
so if you're not vertically integrated

2570
02:19:02,549 --> 02:19:05,148
becomes a whole

2571
02:19:12,689 --> 02:19:18,489
it's gonna break down what because what

2572
02:19:16,269 --> 02:19:22,030
it goes international national not ain't

2573
02:19:18,489 --> 02:19:25,138
gonna work fucking systems yeah alright

2574
02:19:22,030 --> 02:19:28,360
its hat yeah

2575
02:19:25,138 --> 02:19:29,949
far away can that be you know there's a

2576
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:31,900
lot of shit that's breaking down in the

2577
02:19:29,950 --> 02:19:33,790
state that people need to step back and

2578
02:19:31,899 --> 02:19:39,968
say well suck being the first all these

2579
02:19:33,790 --> 02:19:50,620
things I use this that's the luckiest

2580
02:19:39,968 --> 02:19:51,879
thing I've been is not wait what's

2581
02:19:50,620 --> 02:19:53,470
driving on credit

2582
02:19:51,879 --> 02:19:54,789
Travis tanning crazy being the first

2583
02:19:53,469 --> 02:19:56,709
everything you know she had the first

2584
02:19:54,790 --> 02:19:59,320
outward cultivation permit in Sonoma

2585
02:19:56,709 --> 02:20:00,938
County she was the first people to go

2586
02:19:59,319 --> 02:20:02,469
through the whole process in Santa Rosa

2587
02:20:00,939 --> 02:20:04,149
getting warehouses and things like that

2588
02:20:02,469 --> 02:20:06,219
you know it is one of the first people

2589
02:20:04,149 --> 02:20:10,239
to get into metric and she's always been

2590
02:20:06,219 --> 02:20:27,809
ahead of the curve but the first one off

2591
02:20:10,239 --> 02:20:27,809
the boat shot the history that people

2592
02:20:28,020 --> 02:20:37,899
most of those people don't make it the

2593
02:20:35,709 --> 02:20:40,569
ones that you are like argh all these

2594
02:20:37,899 --> 02:21:00,689
years accompanies to not die yeah that's

2595
02:20:40,569 --> 02:21:00,689
our goal yeah

2596
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:15,818
that's why I hunt I hide under the

2597
02:21:06,790 --> 02:21:18,550
appellation the problems like rising

2598
02:21:15,818 --> 02:21:21,068
structure you know I'm from this from

2599
02:21:18,549 --> 02:21:23,139
this journey is a BA we demand this

2600
02:21:21,068 --> 02:21:24,908
price from will go below this and as a

2601
02:21:23,139 --> 02:21:26,709
group you're stronger they just started

2602
02:21:24,908 --> 02:21:29,350
the first era cannabis-based Grange oh

2603
02:21:26,709 --> 02:21:30,669
it's in Sonoma County it's really

2604
02:21:29,350 --> 02:21:32,318
started to build that I always tell

2605
02:21:30,670 --> 02:21:34,600
Peter I think there's about two billion

2606
02:21:32,318 --> 02:21:36,430
that's coming out of that region imagine

2607
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:41,318
if that grouped up and started

2608
02:21:36,430 --> 02:21:43,059
controlling yeah it's flour how you know

2609
02:21:41,318 --> 02:21:49,469
if once it goes across the states its

2610
02:21:43,059 --> 02:21:49,469
game in the desert we're coming up there

2611
02:21:51,478 --> 02:21:55,738
you do it then once that ran out

2612
02:22:03,180 --> 02:22:11,408
tell that to orchid extract all of it in

2613
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:13,719
order because if it's just sitting there

2614
02:22:11,408 --> 02:22:15,250
in warehouses like you said it's gonna

2615
02:22:13,719 --> 02:22:17,049
gather this is gonna all these bad

2616
02:22:15,250 --> 02:22:18,908
things it's like alright well what do we

2617
02:22:17,049 --> 02:22:21,009
do we want to make any money I guess we

2618
02:22:18,908 --> 02:22:23,170
extract it that's one dish and then like

2619
02:22:21,010 --> 02:22:25,568
at least have like the oils and the

2620
02:22:23,170 --> 02:22:26,978
candle cannabinoids and just you know

2621
02:22:25,568 --> 02:22:29,079
stuff to work with it's got something to

2622
02:22:26,978 --> 02:22:33,818
work with it is valuing CBN because it

2623
02:22:29,079 --> 02:22:36,629
has the agent I think eventually the

2624
02:22:33,818 --> 02:22:38,709
desert is gonna be the hub for

2625
02:22:36,629 --> 02:22:41,738
extraction because of the climate

2626
02:22:38,709 --> 02:22:43,868
because the dryness and the facilities

2627
02:22:41,738 --> 02:22:45,309
that they have and what they'll do once

2628
02:22:43,869 --> 02:22:46,720
you've got international going and

2629
02:22:45,309 --> 02:22:49,299
national you can just start pulling from

2630
02:22:46,719 --> 02:22:51,068
everywhere and and that's when you start

2631
02:22:49,299 --> 02:22:53,198
blended you know that's when you start

2632
02:22:51,068 --> 02:22:57,068
blending some of these extractions that

2633
02:22:53,199 --> 02:22:58,540
people emulate Wow life well you know

2634
02:22:57,068 --> 02:23:00,818
you're talking about like with the CVD

2635
02:22:58,540 --> 02:23:02,500
like that's how you get your that's how

2636
02:23:00,818 --> 02:23:04,988
you use your brand out there

2637
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:07,000
you get national nationwide then you can

2638
02:23:04,988 --> 02:23:09,039
go worldwide however there's one Great

2639
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:11,200
Lakes and once it flips over like you

2640
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:14,950
know you're already there that's what

2641
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:18,670
you were asked for me because eventually

2642
02:23:14,950 --> 02:23:21,579
the Appalachian whatever plant it's it's

2643
02:23:18,670 --> 02:23:26,200
whether it's a 0.3 or not it's gonna

2644
02:23:21,579 --> 02:23:30,010
have to thrive on being able to coat the

2645
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:31,270
cultivate X amount of acres it's not

2646
02:23:30,010 --> 02:23:33,609
gonna be able to be able to small farm

2647
02:23:31,270 --> 02:23:35,200
like what like sorry has it kind of with

2648
02:23:33,609 --> 02:23:36,399
some of those people are saying like oh

2649
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:38,920
we're gonna put together these small

2650
02:23:36,398 --> 02:23:43,659
little you know into you know 10,000

2651
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:45,010
foot be these collective word yeah

2652
02:23:43,659 --> 02:23:47,439
there'll be different places for that

2653
02:23:45,010 --> 02:23:50,590
but what I'd like to see is where I can

2654
02:23:47,439 --> 02:23:52,779
do those 1020 internet so what on the

2655
02:23:50,590 --> 02:23:56,529
global market you're also completing

2656
02:23:52,779 --> 02:23:59,560
with the exactly was a pentagram out of

2657
02:23:56,529 --> 02:24:02,290
Thailand you will reduce data planning

2658
02:23:59,559 --> 02:24:07,510
of Graham wool it's a Thailand product

2659
02:24:02,290 --> 02:24:11,920
yes it's a Thailand product yes see on a

2660
02:24:07,510 --> 02:24:13,148
global market but it can only grow a

2661
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:15,040
Thailand product

2662
02:24:13,148 --> 02:24:17,139
see that's the thing that's that's the

2663
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:20,529
whole thing see Thailand can't do

2664
02:24:17,139 --> 02:24:23,619
tequila and that's what the pencil II

2665
02:24:20,529 --> 02:24:26,560
people are gonna eventually people are

2666
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:28,979
gonna realize that it's only good brands

2667
02:24:26,559 --> 02:24:31,359
are gonna come out of the Appalachians

2668
02:24:28,978 --> 02:24:38,679
what's good in Thailand what there's got

2669
02:24:31,359 --> 02:24:43,229
to be what know the suit in Thailand

2670
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:47,920
what's to get oh good Thai soup fuck

2671
02:24:43,228 --> 02:24:49,688

2672
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:52,689
court you know what I'm saying that it

2673
02:24:49,689 --> 02:24:54,488
that what it's a different ice thickness

2674
02:24:52,689 --> 02:24:56,260
was the salmon needs you're not gonna

2675
02:24:54,488 --> 02:25:01,539
fucking so if I got Thai stick right

2676
02:24:56,260 --> 02:25:03,870
here but no I hear what you're saying

2677
02:25:01,540 --> 02:25:06,510
and and know that there it was

2678
02:25:03,870 --> 02:25:08,910
there is a market there but I don't I

2679
02:25:06,510 --> 02:25:10,889
don't see us you know I don't see you

2680
02:25:08,909 --> 02:25:13,079
see people like cash market so

2681
02:25:10,889 --> 02:25:15,149
California will still rule on this oh by

2682
02:25:13,079 --> 02:25:20,489
far by far

2683
02:25:15,149 --> 02:25:22,619
that's what French is always there you

2684
02:25:20,489 --> 02:25:25,829
dumb fuckers you don't know what you

2685
02:25:22,620 --> 02:25:27,450
have well it has to start that's why it

2686
02:25:25,829 --> 02:25:29,489
doesn't make any sense for him to argue

2687
02:25:27,450 --> 02:25:31,800
about the this valley

2688
02:25:29,489 --> 02:25:33,780
you know Valley has the characteristic

2689
02:25:31,799 --> 02:25:37,279
so and you're just arguing for

2690
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:37,280
argument's sake but that's right it

2691
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:45,149
doesn't have the hype yet it doesn't

2692
02:25:43,139 --> 02:25:47,879
have the name nor how my Internet

2693
02:25:45,149 --> 02:25:49,680
Explorer through any Morocco ok well how

2694
02:25:47,879 --> 02:25:51,629
dare do I compare it to the Emerald

2695
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:53,521
triangle either you know there's a lot

2696
02:25:51,629 --> 02:25:55,770
of people that if if I would say I

2697
02:25:53,521 --> 02:25:58,980
personally think that the cannabis that

2698
02:25:55,771 --> 02:26:09,570
comes out of my range or better than any

2699
02:25:58,979 --> 02:26:12,000
of fucking rivals it you know when you

2700
02:26:09,569 --> 02:26:14,879
really look at it and and you put it in

2701
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,110
some nobody there's some somebody's up

2702
02:26:14,879 --> 02:26:18,629
there that don't want to expose

2703
02:26:16,110 --> 02:26:20,700
themselves that do have fucking

2704
02:26:18,629 --> 02:26:23,159
beautiful genetics that people will

2705
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:30,150
eventually realize all shallow they over

2706
02:26:23,159 --> 02:26:34,260
yeah can you bring me some of that plant

2707
02:26:30,149 --> 02:26:37,260
speeded life here but yeah I think

2708
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:38,729
because of the dryness and the two are

2709
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:41,639
that like I was talking about the soil

2710
02:26:38,729 --> 02:26:44,310
the fungi the the different you know the

2711
02:26:41,639 --> 02:26:46,829
acidity to the alkaline we had a

2712
02:26:44,310 --> 02:26:48,539
bacterias and alkaline and acidity we

2713
02:26:46,829 --> 02:26:50,670
have a lot more alkaline we're in that

2714
02:26:48,540 --> 02:26:55,320
mineral with mineral high mineralization

2715
02:26:50,670 --> 02:26:58,049
that the soul the the silicon and some

2716
02:26:55,319 --> 02:27:00,510
of the other minerals in it are you know

2717
02:26:58,049 --> 02:27:02,549
we had the crystallization there and so

2718
02:27:00,510 --> 02:27:06,450
that's what the plant when she's making

2719
02:27:02,549 --> 02:27:09,179
those cannabinoids those CBN you know

2720
02:27:06,450 --> 02:27:14,670
from that CBN that starts to break down

2721
02:27:09,180 --> 02:27:17,310
in that flour and and that uses the iron

2722
02:27:14,670 --> 02:27:17,699
he was saying is that iron so if you can

2723
02:27:17,310 --> 02:27:19,738
you just

2724
02:27:17,699 --> 02:27:22,109
when iron and war of magnesium into your

2725
02:27:19,738 --> 02:27:25,259
soil to provoke those things yeah oh

2726
02:27:22,109 --> 02:27:27,930
yeah but she's only gonna use as much as

2727
02:27:25,259 --> 02:27:29,668
the Sun and that she can work with as a

2728
02:27:27,930 --> 02:27:32,488
process you know and that come first

2729
02:27:29,668 --> 02:27:34,770
stage - if it's too moist you want that

2730
02:27:32,488 --> 02:27:37,408
dryness and you want that bright UV that

2731
02:27:34,770 --> 02:27:40,229
UVB light you know and that really

2732
02:27:37,408 --> 02:27:41,878
starts to create something in that wall

2733
02:27:40,228 --> 02:27:44,068
you know she's pulling these different

2734
02:27:41,879 --> 02:27:46,169
minerals you know when we know the iron

2735
02:27:44,068 --> 02:27:49,528
and the magnesium are the two important

2736
02:27:46,168 --> 02:27:52,378
you know the magnesium the tilts all of

2737
02:27:49,529 --> 02:27:57,060
these factors coming together yes

2738
02:27:52,379 --> 02:27:58,770
with mother nature did make mistakes and

2739
02:27:57,059 --> 02:28:01,048
that's what we're gonna find like with

2740
02:27:58,770 --> 02:28:03,779
these different profiles and cannabinoid

2741
02:28:01,049 --> 02:28:05,129
profiles is certain things work for

2742
02:28:03,779 --> 02:28:09,109
certain people let's say you got the

2743
02:28:05,129 --> 02:28:09,109
arthritis or you got whatever it may be

2744
02:28:13,609 --> 02:28:33,658
Malbec flinty you know it dries your

2745
02:28:31,228 --> 02:28:35,458

2746
02:28:33,658 --> 02:28:36,898
a hard environment like most denied you

2747
02:28:35,459 --> 02:28:42,600

2749
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:47,039
to get out of there as quick as possible

2750
02:28:43,850 --> 02:28:53,119
because it's a harsh environment you

2751
02:28:47,039 --> 02:28:55,379
know it's not a fun place to be that

2752

2765
02:29:31,069 --> 02:29:36,770

2766
02:29:32,899 --> 02:29:47,690
but the plant thrives it's Roger and

2767
02:29:36,771 --> 02:29:50,390

you know your jugga-jugga choice me you

2769
02:29:50,389 --> 02:29:56,299
know that's a bad one Fox people's

2770
02:29:52,629 --> 02:29:57,799
doesn't number on people but essentially

2771
02:29:56,299 --> 02:29:59,959
these people there's a lot in the city

2772
02:29:57,799 --> 02:30:02,239
you know but essentially they kind of

2773
02:29:59,959 --> 02:30:05,029
stick out there but it is a harsh

2774
02:30:02,239 --> 02:30:09,100
environment you know and that's the kind

2775
02:30:05,030 --> 02:30:09,100
of people who go to those places to work

2776
02:30:09,610 --> 02:30:14,239
hanging out at the beach doing a bunch

2777
02:30:11,750 --> 02:30:16,729
of drugs so you went from Huntington

2778
02:30:14,239 --> 02:30:19,521
Beach climbing all over California I've

2779
02:30:16,729 --> 02:30:23,350
been I used to live up in Mammoth and I

2780
02:30:19,521 --> 02:30:25,850
was a patroller up in June I had

2781
02:30:23,350 --> 02:30:28,909
disappeared snowboard up there I did

2782
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:31,399
both it was a patroller at Jun for a few

2783
02:30:28,909 --> 02:30:33,680
years so I had to learn how to ski

2784
02:30:31,399 --> 02:30:35,779
because you because you started as a

2785
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:38,210
snowboarder yeah well I snowboard since

2786
02:30:35,780 --> 02:30:40,370
I was a young kid yeah in our local

2787
02:30:38,209 --> 02:30:42,770
mountains I skied first and then sort of

2788
02:30:40,370 --> 02:30:45,710
snow or into my first ski when I was

2789
02:30:42,771 --> 02:30:46,579
super young like 89 and I was like I

2790
02:30:45,709 --> 02:30:48,139
don't like that now has been

2791
02:30:46,579 --> 02:30:52,489
snowboarding was just getting cool like

2792
02:30:48,139 --> 02:30:54,949
you know mid eighties snowboard thing

2793
02:30:52,489 --> 02:30:56,810
you know it looks way funner and so I

2794
02:30:54,950 --> 02:30:59,990
never went back at times I snowboard

2795
02:30:56,810 --> 02:31:02,090
once and got hurt so bad and went back

2796
02:30:59,989 --> 02:31:03,949
to skis for like two or three years and

2797
02:31:02,090 --> 02:31:08,569
it took a lesson and once I take a

2798
02:31:03,950 --> 02:31:10,311
lesson I will never put skis on I hurt

2799
02:31:08,569 --> 02:31:12,170
myself pretty good on skis but they're

2800
02:31:10,310 --> 02:31:15,020
both fun you know

2801
02:31:12,170 --> 02:31:18,860
this skis definitely blow apart yardsale

2802
02:31:15,021 --> 02:31:20,040
it's all I could dig what he goes this

2803
02:31:18,860 --> 02:31:28,319
way

2804
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:31,160
or catches like you like rip your it

2805
02:31:28,319 --> 02:31:34,110
hurts until you learn that's the same

2806
02:31:31,159 --> 02:31:41,420
that's life though that should be learn

2807
02:31:34,110 --> 02:31:43,800
these companies coming in for billion

2808
02:31:41,420 --> 02:31:45,809
pay your dues and that's the truth

2809
02:31:43,799 --> 02:31:49,349
that's just like snowboard skiing

2810
02:31:45,809 --> 02:31:50,670
baseball whatever whatever maybe acting

2811
02:31:49,350 --> 02:31:54,271
these actors don't become active

2812
02:31:50,670 --> 02:31:56,159
overnight burn rates though for

2813
02:31:54,271 --> 02:31:57,630
marketing dollars and like I don't know

2814
02:31:56,159 --> 02:31:59,159
how its sustainable to put a five

2815
02:31:57,629 --> 02:32:00,779
thousand dollar kiosk can do it

2816
02:31:59,159 --> 02:32:06,271
dispensary every month well you're not

2817
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:08,460
selling five thousand crazy how are you

2818
02:32:06,271 --> 02:32:10,079
which one mighty confidence let's be

2819
02:32:08,459 --> 02:32:12,359
specific which companies are doing that

2820
02:32:10,079 --> 02:32:14,430
well so for example at urbe here down

2821
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:18,390
the street they have a model where they

2822
02:32:14,430 --> 02:32:21,360
have like probably 12 or 13 now yeah

2823
02:32:18,389 --> 02:32:23,909
nice job paying between five and ten or

2824
02:32:21,360 --> 02:32:28,260
fifteen thousand dollars her booth then

2825
02:32:23,909 --> 02:32:31,680
I'm and eight by sellers from that you

2826
02:32:28,260 --> 02:32:36,360
know pay to me I was done now which

2827
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:40,771
brands are in there so Cresco yeah

2828
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:44,460
so yes select I think I'll in this got a

2829
02:32:40,771 --> 02:32:45,720
thing in there yeah can't craft cuz

2830
02:32:44,459 --> 02:32:47,489
there's a handful of alright it's the

2831
02:32:45,719 --> 02:32:48,840
same ones you've seen every dispensary

2832
02:32:47,489 --> 02:32:50,850
in SoCal you know but some of them

2833
02:32:48,840 --> 02:32:52,380
they've taken this model and they put it

2834
02:32:50,850 --> 02:32:54,090
out there and it's the pay for play

2835
02:32:52,379 --> 02:32:55,679
space it's tricky because it's working

2836
02:32:54,090 --> 02:32:57,540
out eventually if everyone starts

2837
02:32:55,680 --> 02:33:02,069
pay-for-play you're gonna be save twenty

2838
02:32:57,540 --> 02:33:05,370
customers the same twenty every state

2839
02:33:02,069 --> 02:33:08,549
did and the local municipal did with

2840
02:33:05,370 --> 02:33:10,710
permits you know here pay gonna spot

2841
02:33:08,549 --> 02:33:11,069
paying this spot how much money you

2842
02:33:10,709 --> 02:33:13,199
gonna pay

2843
02:33:11,069 --> 02:33:23,279
well it's up to you how good the spot

2844
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:25,140
you get no becoming at breaks they've a

2845
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:26,521
million dollars a year to spend on

2846
02:33:25,139 --> 02:33:29,149
marketing because that's what their

2847
02:33:26,521 --> 02:33:29,150
budget was

2848
02:33:32,049 --> 02:33:35,420
where else are you gonna go you know

2849
02:33:34,068 --> 02:33:37,010
they're trying to get mortgage chair

2850
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:42,100
knows what everything else gets stripped

2851
02:33:37,010 --> 02:33:44,719
away baby something why they're doing it

2852
02:33:42,100 --> 02:33:48,380
you know to be an anchor brand and one

2853
02:33:44,719 --> 02:33:53,898
of these brands but they're still just

2854
02:33:48,379 --> 02:33:55,099
throwing away that's it for little

2855
02:33:53,898 --> 02:33:57,439
companies to fight against those

2856
02:33:55,100 --> 02:33:59,780
marketing dollars I think we ask all of

2857
02:33:57,439 --> 02:34:02,180
them alligator you know the we got some

2858
02:33:59,780 --> 02:34:03,829
put them on the spot you know the

2859
02:34:02,180 --> 02:34:05,540
retailer's about whether they're paying

2860
02:34:03,829 --> 02:34:07,760
to play and paying for placement and

2861
02:34:05,540 --> 02:34:10,609
forcing people to you know to do that

2862
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:17,389
and they don't really talk about don't

2863
02:34:10,609 --> 02:34:21,260
we ask that question do you have people

2864
02:34:17,389 --> 02:34:22,818
pay for pretty lucky cuz we're a small

2865
02:34:21,260 --> 02:34:25,130
company that some of the places they do

2866
02:34:22,818 --> 02:34:27,289
paver play haven't charged us for spot

2867
02:34:25,129 --> 02:34:29,629
cuz they respect the small farmers they

2868
02:34:27,290 --> 02:34:32,090
want to try cuz those people the buyers

2869
02:34:29,629 --> 02:34:35,750
in the displeasure of their tokens yeah

2870
02:34:32,090 --> 02:34:37,939
yeah because they like their can make

2871
02:34:35,750 --> 02:34:40,728
her kill though if your craft come

2872
02:34:37,939 --> 02:34:43,148
Fiddler's greens digest abusive make up

although based okay no I think sure okay

2874
02:34:43,148 --> 02:34:47,180
but you know they allow because they

2875
02:34:45,950 --> 02:34:48,920
know they can make or break the small

2876
02:34:47,180 --> 02:34:51,109
farmer you know if they always just go

2877
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:53,478
to pay and play it's over for the small

2878
02:34:51,109 --> 02:34:55,579
craft products well I would take a smart

2879
02:34:53,478 --> 02:34:58,309
way for a retailer even if you're doing

2880
02:34:55,579 --> 02:35:00,859
the token brand that represents the

2881
02:34:58,309 --> 02:35:04,250
number of farmers or something lad like

2882
02:35:00,859 --> 02:35:08,479
that at least fucking have that and you

2883
02:35:04,250 --> 02:35:10,340
charge the edible company you know what

2884
02:35:08,478 --> 02:35:12,318
last year I forget where we were back

2885
02:35:10,340 --> 02:35:15,590
east but we went into a little wine shop

2886
02:35:12,318 --> 02:35:18,228
and in there it was an independent like

2887
02:35:15,590 --> 02:35:20,420
wine shop not a huge chain and they had

2888
02:35:18,228 --> 02:35:22,279
like there was a basket with this wine

2889
02:35:20,420 --> 02:35:25,549
in it and we were looking for some wine

2890
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:28,609
and they had a whole description of the

2891
02:35:25,549 --> 02:35:30,379
wine and how it was grown and the people

2892
02:35:28,609 --> 02:35:31,909
that I read the whole fucking thing you

2893
02:35:30,379 --> 02:35:34,608
know and if I don't know why I read it

2894
02:35:31,909 --> 02:35:36,079
and but I did and it was a whole long

2895
02:35:34,609 --> 02:35:40,059
sheet and they've gone to that trouble

2896
02:35:36,079 --> 02:35:42,609
and there was a story there about

2897
02:35:40,059 --> 02:35:44,920
Vineyard you now and the person growing

2898
02:35:42,609 --> 02:35:46,750
these grapes in this wine and it's and

2899
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:49,059
cannabis has to do Center you buy the

2900
02:35:46,750 --> 02:35:51,520
wine we did get wine from there I could

2901
02:35:49,059 --> 02:35:52,840
get a bottle one and they had a club and

2902
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:55,060
they who I had a whole thing and I think

2903
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:56,799
we might have been in Orlando where my

2904
02:35:55,059 --> 02:35:58,478
brother lives so I think he was a member

2905
02:35:56,799 --> 02:36:00,849
of it yeah no there's got to be a story

2906
02:35:58,478 --> 02:36:02,408
behind it you know just saying you know

2907
02:36:00,850 --> 02:36:04,420
but they're allowed to do more things

2908
02:36:02,408 --> 02:36:07,420
where you can do a wine clothing you can

2909
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:08,738
do uh you know so when you know I'm

2910
02:36:07,420 --> 02:36:10,779
telling you there's money to be made

2911
02:36:08,738 --> 02:36:13,658
when you know and we've thought about

2912
02:36:10,779 --> 02:36:15,908
this about curating you know and and

2913
02:36:13,658 --> 02:36:17,920
wait if you can go not everyone can go

2914
02:36:15,908 --> 02:36:20,590
to the Emerald cup but if you can go to

2915
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:23,049
the Emerald cup and act as a curator for

2916
02:36:20,590 --> 02:36:25,389
that seasons for other people like

2917
02:36:23,049 --> 02:36:26,828
around the run and be able to curate for

2918
02:36:25,389 --> 02:36:29,379
them in the pre-op to provide that for

2919
02:36:26,828 --> 02:36:31,779
them it's a fucking business model yeah

2920
02:36:29,379 --> 02:36:34,448
it has legs on it and when you can

2921
02:36:31,779 --> 02:36:36,880
deliver that product freshly within a

2922
02:36:34,449 --> 02:36:38,859
couple of days or whatever yeah now

2923
02:36:36,879 --> 02:36:41,259
you're talking now this long farm or

2924
02:36:38,859 --> 02:36:43,960
hazard Iraq eventually when the

2925
02:36:41,260 --> 02:36:46,300
International National you know can and

2926
02:36:43,959 --> 02:36:48,519
that and that and that does require a

2927
02:36:46,299 --> 02:36:53,858
level of cure a because not everyone can

2928
02:36:48,520 --> 02:36:55,720
go there to smell and to see two years

2929
02:36:53,859 --> 02:36:57,550
in a row killing it no and to be able to

2930
02:36:55,719 --> 02:36:59,738
do those things that have none of those

2931
02:36:57,549 --> 02:37:02,198
had to understand I look at it this way

2932
02:36:59,738 --> 02:37:04,118
if you had clients around you're going

2933
02:37:02,199 --> 02:37:04,540
I'm gonna pick ten strains and I'm in

2934
02:37:04,119 --> 02:37:08,350
the village

2935
02:37:04,540 --> 02:37:10,649
if you were right half the time you hit

2936
02:37:08,350 --> 02:37:10,649
a home run

2937
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:14,109
it's pretty subjective that what will

2938
02:37:12,969 --> 02:37:16,269
you take it just so that was cool but

2939
02:37:14,109 --> 02:37:18,130
they grow off was there was the same to

2940
02:37:16,270 --> 02:37:20,140
save strength everybody so you to see

2941
02:37:18,129 --> 02:37:22,389
the exact same terpene you never

2942
02:37:20,139 --> 02:37:25,180
denominations but the different levels

2943
02:37:22,389 --> 02:37:28,180
of the baby was it was a great a v8

2944
02:37:25,180 --> 02:37:30,158
experiment to show how different one

2945
02:37:28,180 --> 02:37:32,050
strongly yeah based on separate

2946
02:37:30,158 --> 02:37:34,328
microclimate that really has to be done

2947
02:37:32,049 --> 02:37:37,420
within the Appalachians year after year

2948
02:37:34,328 --> 02:37:39,068
I think you know to really start joking

2949
02:37:37,420 --> 02:37:40,449
and figuring things out

2950
02:37:39,068 --> 02:37:42,459
that's the whole thing I mean this

2951
02:37:40,449 --> 02:37:46,180
thing's this whole process dates data

2952
02:37:42,459 --> 02:37:47,919
prize data aggregate but how do you you

2953
02:37:46,180 --> 02:37:49,270
know when the data is being held up by

2954
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:50,680
the regulation

2955
02:37:49,270 --> 02:37:52,869
that's the fuck thing right now you know

2956
02:37:50,680 --> 02:37:54,818
the data and then in the science people

2957
02:37:52,869 --> 02:37:57,220
do yeah they also hold on to their data

2958
02:37:54,818 --> 02:37:59,828
data ain't there's so much in Canada if

2959
02:37:57,219 --> 02:38:02,648
I could protect my data I would release

2960
02:37:59,828 --> 02:38:06,359
it all but right now okay I give you

2961
02:38:02,648 --> 02:38:06,358
know I like what happened with the whole

2962
02:38:07,949 --> 02:38:14,078
I don't know much about files I just

2963
02:38:11,109 --> 02:38:20,380
know some people feel they got the bad

2964
02:38:14,078 --> 02:38:26,260
in the file of stick the galaxy watch

2965
02:38:20,379 --> 02:38:28,389
too and you know looking back now you

2966
02:38:26,260 --> 02:38:29,949
know look like some oh yeah rat I want

2967
02:38:28,389 --> 02:38:31,809
to be a part of that I want to log into

2968
02:38:29,949 --> 02:38:37,300
that and now thinking about it like I

2969
02:38:31,809 --> 02:38:39,278
would be like oh fuck because it is my

2970
02:38:37,299 --> 02:38:42,639
DNA comes from my BOB now you can

2971
02:38:39,279 --> 02:38:44,170
duplicate whatever that particular you

2972
02:38:42,639 --> 02:38:46,750
know and if that was the fire that

2973
02:38:44,170 --> 02:38:48,250
everybody wants now you have that code

2974
02:38:46,750 --> 02:38:50,228
to it and that's the whole thing about

2975
02:38:48,250 --> 02:38:51,850
the IP is it protects that code it

2976
02:38:50,228 --> 02:38:54,519
protects that creates a lot of feeling

2977
02:38:51,850 --> 02:38:55,720
people well yeah now I can go up against

2978
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:57,550
the Giants that's what's so beautiful

2979
02:38:55,719 --> 02:38:58,840
when you really start looking at this

2980
02:38:57,549 --> 02:39:00,698
whole thing and you start connecting

2981
02:38:58,840 --> 02:39:03,068
dots with the appalachian because with

2982
02:39:00,699 --> 02:39:04,720
only it's only take the only thing the

2983
02:39:03,068 --> 02:39:06,939
appalachian will work is because the

2984
02:39:04,719 --> 02:39:09,129
government's gonna realize oh yeah there

2985
02:39:06,939 --> 02:39:10,359
is two billion dollars in this little

2986
02:39:09,129 --> 02:39:12,188
hub right here that's why the hillock

2987
02:39:10,359 --> 02:39:13,359
copters are flying around and then

2988
02:39:12,189 --> 02:39:15,880
looking at the shit and they're going

2989
02:39:13,359 --> 02:39:17,590
holy shit how do we we just fucking

2990
02:39:15,879 --> 02:39:20,139
rainy them for a year straight and look

2991
02:39:17,590 --> 02:39:21,880
at their even more you know like they're

2992
02:39:20,139 --> 02:39:23,139
trying to figure it all out eventually

2993
02:39:21,879 --> 02:39:25,448
they're gonna go we'll listen quick

2994
02:39:23,139 --> 02:39:28,719
let's make it let's try and work with it

2995
02:39:25,449 --> 02:39:31,119
and that's when the whole thing will

2996
02:39:28,719 --> 02:39:33,158
start being protected what do you mean

2997
02:39:31,119 --> 02:39:34,720
fucking India you're doing this or what

2998
02:39:33,158 --> 02:39:36,219
do you mean you know this other states

2999
02:39:34,719 --> 02:39:38,879
fucking with our little bread and butter

3000
02:39:36,219 --> 02:39:41,288
over here eventually I hope to see that

3001
02:39:38,879 --> 02:39:43,599
kind of come out of it and that the

3002
02:39:41,289 --> 02:39:45,460
little small that that particular read

3003
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:47,738
it's not just a small farmer but it's

3004
02:39:45,459 --> 02:39:49,269
all that the the whole and compass of

3005
02:39:47,738 --> 02:39:52,500
farmers within the region that are

3006
02:39:49,270 --> 02:39:54,250
protected under those IPS in that

3007
02:39:52,500 --> 02:39:56,289
Appalachian origin that they're

3008
02:39:54,250 --> 02:39:58,059
protecting that product we want that

3009
02:39:56,289 --> 02:39:59,859
standard and we want to make that money

3010
02:39:58,059 --> 02:40:01,710
off that now you get people to realize

3011
02:39:59,859 --> 02:40:03,810
that like oh shit

3012
02:40:01,710 --> 02:40:07,560
Wow there's a lot of money here all we

3013
02:40:03,810 --> 02:40:08,970
got to do is make it work then it starts

3014
02:40:07,560 --> 02:40:10,770
clicking and some standards and

3015
02:40:08,970 --> 02:40:13,710
practices to it you know something

3016
02:40:10,771 --> 02:40:16,950
that's fucking sustainable you know

3017
02:40:13,710 --> 02:40:17,520
let's not eat the whole place up spit it

3018
02:40:16,950 --> 02:40:19,591
out

3019
02:40:17,521 --> 02:40:25,351
that would be and then I'd be kind of

3020
02:40:19,591 --> 02:40:29,851
happy to die after that one someone

3021
02:40:25,351 --> 02:40:35,161
maybe a couple screenplays definitely

3022
02:40:29,851 --> 02:40:36,841
tell stories but now that would be cool

3023
02:40:35,161 --> 02:40:38,729
you know be one of the old guys look

3024
02:40:36,841 --> 02:40:41,190
back 20 years from now and go yeah that

3025
02:40:38,729 --> 02:40:43,350
was the dude that was thinking out side

3026
02:40:41,190 --> 02:40:45,751
the box with the other people you know

3027
02:40:43,351 --> 02:40:51,751
up north that made something out of this

3028
02:40:45,751 --> 02:40:52,440
area now it's just tourists yeah yeah

3029
02:40:51,751 --> 02:40:54,149
whatever

3030
02:40:52,440 --> 02:40:56,101
do you know those oh geez that we're

3031
02:40:54,149 --> 02:40:58,350
planting in Temecula you know same with

3032
02:40:56,101 --> 02:41:00,271
Sonoma you know that had that dream hey

that's a lot of people ask me like how

3062
02:42:37,590 --> 02:42:41,790
do you choose certain you know like when

3063
02:42:40,049 --> 02:42:43,799
you're going through your clones or your

3064
02:42:41,790 --> 02:42:45,030
planets or whatever I don't fuck with

3065
02:42:43,799 --> 02:42:46,920
clones because they don't make it out

3066
02:42:45,030 --> 02:42:49,920
there so much I mean no doubt but you

3067
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:51,510
don't do what my seeds do and and I and

3068
02:42:49,920 --> 02:42:55,500
I they're like this is a little too

3069
02:42:51,510 --> 02:42:58,170
tough for me yeah things out pretty

3070
02:42:55,500 --> 02:42:59,250
young because it hardens them up you

3071
02:42:58,170 --> 02:43:01,200
know and a lot of people are like well

3072
02:42:59,250 --> 02:43:02,850
you know I want to keep it so I'm like

3073
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:04,230
it's almost like character if you keep a

3074
02:43:02,850 --> 02:43:11,550
good person in a bubble of their whole

3075
02:43:04,229 --> 02:43:13,260
life yeah clothes under things it builds

3076
02:43:11,549 --> 02:43:14,909
this character and that's what happens

3077
02:43:13,260 --> 02:43:16,979
in the flower you know that's what those

3078
02:43:14,909 --> 02:43:19,110
terpenes are they're they're they're

3079
02:43:16,979 --> 02:43:21,209
expressions of character yeah you know

3080
02:43:19,110 --> 02:43:23,940
they're expressions of personality and

3081
02:43:21,209 --> 02:43:29,789
and that's what you get when you expose

3082
02:43:23,940 --> 02:43:37,200
that flower to those elements like if

3083
02:43:29,790 --> 02:43:38,400
you call someone how she chose her males

3084
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:40,200
and she said just tell them all out in

3085
02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:41,159
the woods and you come back looking a

3086
02:43:40,200 --> 02:43:47,100
month later though well this is all

3087
02:43:41,159 --> 02:43:48,389
alive to take a feat you take a male and

3088
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:49,920
you got them in a pot and you put them

3089
02:43:48,389 --> 02:43:51,869
out with the females right before it he

3090
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:55,409
bursts and it makes them go fucking and

3091
02:43:51,870 --> 02:43:57,180
the females nuts and that's what that's

3092
02:43:55,409 --> 02:44:01,100
when you really start getting into

3093
02:43:57,180 --> 02:44:01,100
male/female and really start unlocking

3094
02:44:02,129 --> 02:44:10,079
science yeah
