2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:20,460
there seems to be a disconnect in this

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,618
industry we have we seem to have a weird

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,868
line just going down the middle of this

5
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:27,839
industry we seem to have people that are

6
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:29,849
fighting the fight working on the regs

7
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,920
working on the policy working on the

8
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,710
ordinances spending time with state

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,960
county city officials trying to make

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,030
sure that we all have fair equitable and

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,070
inclusive cannabis policy going forward

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,079
because let's remember this is the first

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,500
and only time California will do this

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,259
the first time so it's really up to us

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,869
to make sure that we get it right as

16
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,640
right as we possibly can given the

17
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,399
limitations and circumstances that may

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,649
happen in you know with everything going

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,219
on what I wanted to try to do tonight is

20
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,170
sort of shine a light on the advocates

21
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,469
and the nonprofit's because here's the

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,849
deal those are the people who are making

23
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:11,239
all this happen those are the people who

24
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:14,158
are working hard with all of the

25
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:17,429
government to make sure that there is a

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,030
solid foundation for businesses to sit

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,920
on top of and actually make money we the

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,570
other side of the coin is those people

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,200
who are in it for the money only or

30
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:26,819
they're in it for their own

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,299
self-interest and they're not

32
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,639
contributing back so we have a problem I

33
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,229
think we need to talk about it it really

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,228
hasn't been talked about that much I

35
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:39,060
really just want to commend everybody in

36
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:42,539
this room for showing up tonight we have

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,359
so many amazing people and organizations

38
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,240
that are out there every single day

39
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,769
making sure that there's good policy

40
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,789
when you're talking to your friends and

41
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:53,578
you're talking to other businesses

42
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,810
cannabis businesses encourage them after

43
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:56,188
tonight after you listen to what's

44
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,320
happening encourage them to get out

45
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:59,639
there and support encourage them to get

46
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,349
out there and volunteer and curse them

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,790
together go speak to a city council and

48
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:04,949
Curson to get out there and put money in

49
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,270
if they have money in to support some of

50
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,039
these funders with these foundations I

51
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:09,959
mean MPP is here in the house tonight

52
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,089
Marijuana Policy Project drug policy

53
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,409
Alliance is here tonight I know that

54
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,180
these organizations

55
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:17,969
who are really doing some of the heavy

56
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,890
lifting they're struggling for financing

57
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:22,139
they're struggling for funding why is

58
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:24,839
that these are the people who help carry

59
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,309
the baton over the line and get us to

60
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,200
legalization and yet we can't seem to

61
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,909
get them funded so and it's not just

62
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,919
them there's a lot of people who work in

63
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:35,159
this industry every day who get no

64
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,479
dollars $0 but they're still going and

65
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,520
doing it because they believe that it's

66
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,349
the right thing to do so that's what

67
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,990
we're going to talk about tonight so I

68
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:45,150
want to start with a couple of quotes

69
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,159
from the people that are not here

70
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,539
tonight and also one that I'm going to

71
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:53,099
read to you right now so there's this

72
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,349
amazing woman her name's Susan Burton

73
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,509
some of you may or may not know her okay

74
00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:00,569
got becoming Miss Burton I know some

75
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:02,419
people in the room know this is so Suman

76
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:04,620
has this amazing folks she does a

77
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:06,599
re-entry for women that have been

78
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,689
incarcerated and are trying to go back

79
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:17,490
into their real life she has a quote in

80
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:19,650
this book that I want to read so so

81
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,200
she's actually quoting somebody else

82
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:25,469
telling her this story a long time ago

83
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,089
and here's the quote she said they said

84
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:29,550
there was this book I read as a child it

85
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,370
was called The Little Red Hen where a

86
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,680
hen finds a grain of wheat and goes

87
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,200
around asking all the other farm animals

88
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,379
to help make it into bread but no one

89
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,969
will help finally when the hen manages

90
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,430
all on her own to make the bread

91
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:47,789
everyone who wouldn't help shows up to

92
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:54,840
eat the bread welcome to the cannabis

93
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:57,659
industry all right I'm going to read you

94
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,830
three quotes there fact so some of you

95
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,469
in the house are familiar with some of

96
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,090
these people so Diane Goldstein from

97
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:04,500
leap which is law enforcement used to be

98
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,590
law Enforcement Against Prohibition now

99
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,389
it's law enforcement Action Partnership

100
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,860
Diane Kyne made an interesting comment

101
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:14,458
here she said the Greek playwright

102
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:17,489
Aeschylus once wrote in war truth is the

103
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,048
first casualty his president summary of

104
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:20,759
the nature of conflict and power has

105
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,129
played out on American soil over the

106
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,800
last 40 years as we have strived to make

107
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:27,329
our country drug-free it's clear that

108
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,639
the industry needs to rep

109
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:31,050
knives but they are not just

110
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,750
entrepreneurs but that they are drug

111
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,579
policy reform errs and advocates as well

112
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,769
and can help by continuing to support

113
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,658
drug policy reform organizations that

114
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:40,948
have been instrumental in rolling back

115
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:43,430
the harms of the drug war while

116
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:45,990
protecting all of our civil liberties ok

117
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,418
Lynn Lyman state director for drug

118
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,800
policy Alliance you're walking you're

119
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,779
walking in today to this whole nice

120
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,460
legal world where everybody can wear a

121
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,619
name tag that says there with some

122
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,959
cannabis association whereas five years

123
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,209
ago even people were still doing federal

124
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,279
time for having a dispensary the advice

125
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:03,448
I give to all of those people to come in

126
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,598
who's coming into the cannabis industry

127
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:08,580
is understands a history there is the

128
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:10,860
sense that people are just wait waltzing

129
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:12,959
in as if it's just any other industry

130
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,699
I want to discourage that and reminded

131
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,859
of you that a lot of people have died

132
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,169
people have been incarcerated they've

133
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,639
had their families destroyed making sure

134
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:22,079
you're a good neighbor and you're

135
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,740
working with the communities that you

136
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,448
are based in and finally Kris didn't of

137
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,740
it all who some of you may know in the

138
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:29,908
room Kristen is a chair of the

139
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,819
International cannabis Farmers

140
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:34,740
Association in NorCal Chris DeRose

141
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,598
donations from Canada businesses at

142
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,519
Humboldt have built a community center

143
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:40,889
km UD radio the Civil Liberties

144
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,288
monitoring project local volunteer fire

145
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:45,060
departments technical rescue in sports

146
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:47,519
and art programs that are rural schools

147
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,199
that's a farming community for you she

148
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,848
encourages folks to get involved with

149
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,560
their local community by supporting and

150
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:54,418
volunteering our schools Fire

151
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,689
Department's parks and so much more need

152
00:05:54,418 --> 00:06:00,718
time and donations so we are strong as a

153
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:02,490
group but we need to continue further

154
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:05,159
onto that

155
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,810
as we're talking about advocacy there

156
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,250
are people who've been doing a really

157
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,530
long time and they have lots of stories

158
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,300
and there are people that have are new

159
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:14,279
like myself I'm only a couple years in

160
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,900
but some of these people on this stage

161
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,589
here have been doing this for a really

162
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:18,149
long time

163
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:20,250
so if I'd be really good to be able to

164
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:22,409
ask them some questions listen to their

165
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,269
stories and then figure out how this

166
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,210
conversation so we could figure out what

167
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:28,258
we do going forward so first thing I'm

168
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:30,388
going to do is just have everybody

169
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,250
quickly introduce themselves and tell

170
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,930
you just a short story about their

171
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:42,389
background okay so here we go with Mary

172
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:44,668
Pat thank you I started as an activist

173
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:48,150
of the 80s when Ronald Reagan was still

174
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:49,709
president and back then there wasn't a

175
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:51,629
whole lot of different organizations to

176
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,279
sign up with it was mostly grassroots

177
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:57,569
people you know maybe new in your

178
00:06:53,279 --> 00:07:01,679
community do it normal that was pretty

179
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:04,080
much it and so what we do is organize

180
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,180
with people we knew in our community and

181
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:10,740
we did a lot of wiring and we did a lot

182
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,810
of meeting and events and eventually you

183
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,120
know I started with moving to Seattle

184
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,829
and lit up with this group of people

185
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,418
called the P seasons and we started this

186
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:20,218
little event called the Seattle Hempfest

187
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:23,490
which is now the largest in the country

188
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:28,168
or probably the world 20-some years

189
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:30,329
later we may be myself but take it a

190
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:32,609
long time we've seen a lot of momentum

191
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:34,109
so for me I'm always the optimist like

192
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,180
you know every time they try to throw

193
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,069
some kind of Jeff Sessions at us or

194
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,310
something like that I'm like whatever I

195
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:42,520
lived through Reagan okay I have a

196
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,649
friend

197
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,060
we've come a long way I'm really excited

198
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:47,709
about the progress that we've made with

199
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,089
the problem that I'm starting to see and

200
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:52,180
that certainty in the last couple years

201
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:54,459
is when the culture clash started

202
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,800
happening the suits and the stoners or

203
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:58,839
the activists and capitalists and they

204
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,300
weren't getting along and like water and

205
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,589
oil press just about always getting

206
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,389
along because they just didn't

207
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:05,948
understand each other and I don't think

208
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:08,228
you have to be one or the other you

209
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,699
really can find a way to do both and I

210
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:11,379
think that that's part of what we're

211
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,030
trying to do right now is remember that

212
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:15,699
this was a movement that started out of

213
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:18,549
compassion and it started as a movement

214
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:20,889
about freedom not about money I mean

215
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,680
money we all of course want to make a

216
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:25,689
living and and have a good livelihood

217
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,900
and we're excited and privileged to be

218
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:31,810
able to do that in this industry now but

219
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:35,129
we have a lot of work to do so 25 years

220
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:38,200
later here we are

221
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:39,549
great Howell you want to go now breath I

222
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,390
don't care which one even hell's going

223
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:46,629
alright sure I'll go okay my name is Hal

224
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:49,028
Lewis I know a lot of you in this room

225
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:52,750
which it's really cool

226
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:54,480
I want to take a poll real quick how

227
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,708
many people have been in industry for

228
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,089
the last five years raise your hand

229
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:04,500
excellent how about ten years

230
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:13,029
raise your hand excellent

231
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:15,129
15 years nice 20 years 30 years cool

232
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:19,570
there's a few people in here that have

233
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:21,309
paid their dues okay and somebody's

234
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,400
raising their hand instead saying 50

235
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:26,739
okay the first thing I want to say is my

236
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,970
first detainment was in Los Angeles the

237
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:33,490
Federal Building and Wilshire in 1978

238
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:36,459
petitioning for normal okay I was with

239
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,950
Jack and Steve and a few other people

240
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:41,109
and we were all smoking at 20 on a

241
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,470
federal building grass feeling really

242
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:46,750
good and they came over and he came desk

243
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,490
and I'll never forget it because they

244
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,220
said we could arrest you but we're not

245
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,100
going to because there's a lot of you

246
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:57,269
and some of us believe

247
00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:00,000
you're doing and Jack said no I want to

248
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:02,850
be arrested he was arrested he was sent

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,440
to Lancaster for that week in 1978 I'll

250
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,420
never forget it because we ended up

251
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,490
bailing him out finally and he went in

252
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:11,309
from the judge and then he took the band

253
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:15,029
down to Venice and talked about him

254
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:17,969
see what got me into this was hemp back

255
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:19,860
in the day and was medicine because I

256
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:24,120
lost both my mother and my father to

257
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:26,550
cancer and UCLA was studying it then the

258
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:31,470
one thing that I look at now is where

259
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:33,889
we've come from 1978 to today everybody

260
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:39,120
is fighting for a piece of the pie and

261
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:43,019
the problem is there is no pie in the

262
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,389
oven yet okay bottom line and that pie

263
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,509
is really a cake and that's what it is

264
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:50,730
in the oven okay and there's enough to

265
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:52,409
go around for everybody but it's

266
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,629
something I saw that happened in Nevada

267
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:57,089
a couple years ago when everybody was

268
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:58,919
fighting for licensing and I started a

269
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,840
company there called Las Vegas kind of

270
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:02,339
its information center because I do

271
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,740
things like this to bring the people

272
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:07,170
together and we didn't party every three

273
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,970
months and what we did was we brought

274
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:11,129
all the license people that were out

275
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,710
waiting for application so he said all I

276
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:16,200
want you to do is find a common bond

277
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,570
with somebody else in the room reach

278
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,060
your hand out your neighbors not that

279
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:23,550
bad and in this room I could tell you

280
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:25,679
the same thing there's a lot of people

281
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:28,289
in this room some of them are really

282
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:31,349
good some of them have ulterior motives

283
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:34,319
but they're not all bad it's up to us to

284
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,710
find the good in each and individual

285
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,660
person out there right now you know

286
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,490
advocates we've lost a lot of advocates

287
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:46,740
that a lot of us know over the last

288
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:48,240
couple years okay and some of them bring

289
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,129
it here to my because some of them were

290
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,820
called crazy before they passed away

291
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:54,299
because of their ideas they Jeff rest in

292
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,190
peace

293
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:58,359
Jeff and I went to battle all the time

294
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,430
on Prop 64 I was an advocate

295
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,379
and I worked my ass off for prop 64

296
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:06,549
because of the hemp part in there and

297
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:08,860
for to help people get out of jail but I

298
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:10,209
had a lot of people hate on me because I

299
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,519
was that old hippie

300
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:16,230
that's what taught me that there is a

301
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:18,309
big divide right now in this room

302
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,980
there's still a divide

303
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:23,439
you know and it's cannabis and back in

304
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,050
78 there wasn't really a divide it was

305
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,490
like okay can't we all just get along

306
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:29,589
but can we just smoke a joint

307
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,509
just really help each other and you know

308
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,310
if you needed help your brother or

309
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:36,850
sister would help you no matter what and

310
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:39,429
right now the questions I get on a daily

311
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,610
basis are how can I get in this business

312
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:44,769
what will it take how much money can I

313
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,050
make can you help me get that done over

314
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:49,899
there because I want to get to the next

315
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:52,269
level in business and that goes against

316
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:54,730
everything I was taught about in the

317
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:58,210
cannabis sector the chemical sector

318
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:01,120
first and foremost is medicine okay if

319
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:03,730
we forget about the patient you should

320
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,450
not be in this room or in this industry

321
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:10,990
period the patient is the number one

322
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:15,190
thing period okay that comes from all

323
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:19,480
forms of cannabis marijuana hemp all

324
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:21,160
forms okay I'm sorry I'm going on myself

325
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,320
ahead if I get Brad an opportunity right

326
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:25,000
introduce themselves enough those are

327
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,650
law all of our panelists are very

328
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,049
enthusiastic these are all passing to

329
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:31,059
people and sorry I thought were just

330
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:34,870
introducing ourselves but I guess I was

331
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:37,000
wrong my name is Brad Lane I producer of

332
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:42,039
a television show called cannabis planet

333
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,279
I created that show back in 2009 and I

334
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:48,219
am a cannabis activists and my activism

335
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:51,539
of like this gentleman stems from jack

336
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:57,250
harries work I was in the Haight Ashbury

337
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:57,870
in 1986 or seven at a debt show and I

338
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,539
ran across

339
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,730
book the ever wears no clothes and I've

340
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,860
looked at this book and I thought oh my

341
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,330
god look at this thing and it was

342
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,339
amazing because you didn't have to read

343
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,680
it in linear form like most books it

344
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,810
just was filled with vast voids about

345
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:15,329
cannabis and how hemp could save the

346
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:16,739
planet what the fuck is HAP so I read

347
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:20,070
this book on the airplane on the way

348
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,570
home and it was just it was amazing

349
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,790
much like a Grateful Dead show it was

350
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,010
you know coming of own in my life and

351
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:27,389
and enlightenment so I took that book

352
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:30,059
and I gave it to every member of my

353
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:34,350
family for Christmas because I wanted to

354
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:36,539
show them that hey this proves that my

355
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,060
ideology and using cannabis is not wrong

356
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:40,709
it was kind of a hard sell but that's

357
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:41,939
where my activists have started does

358
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:47,129
anyone in this room know what the

359
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:49,890
three-foot rule is no one the three-foot

360
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:52,470
rule anyone ever heard that it's a

361
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,269
multi-level marketing term and anybody

362
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,430
within three feet of you you're chatting

363
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,838
up about your downline have you heard

364
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,549
about have heard about cannabis it's

365
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,290
pretty amazing stuff hey funny

366
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:03,269
so that was my activism it was the

367
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:05,759
three-foot rule and any by had read the

368
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:08,220
Emperor wears no clothes and anybody

369
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,500
that came within three feet of me I was

370
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,589
explaining about cannabis and the reason

371
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,110
was most activists have an axe to grind

372
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:18,930
and I realized my axe to grind was I

373
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,509
wasn't taken seriously in life because

374
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:23,129
of my cannabis use I was an athlete I

375
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:28,319
played football call it on a scholarship

376
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:30,000
if I lost my keys on the stoner if the

377
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,459
Academy was key is it so you know

378
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,690
mindful so I've often taken seriously in

379
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:38,579
life so I fast forward I have retired

380
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,500
early but some other you know the German

381
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,300
business ideas I had was snowboarding in

382
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,250
the mountains and every year I go to

383
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:45,870
Europe and I would go to Amsterdam

384
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,429
because cannabis was like you were

385
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,240
treated like a normal person there was

386
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:50,879
like paradise

387
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,209
my father got ill when I came back out

388
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:56,220
of the mountains to Long Beach prop 215

389
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:57,319
against of momentum and Long Beach oh my

390
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,210
gosh it was like

391
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,920
Amsterdam had nothing on long beach it

392
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:03,379
was like what the hell happened was gone

393
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:05,919
to the mountains so I decided to bring

394
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,879
that three-foot rule to television and

395
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,099
originally I thought you know what

396
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:11,689
I was already producing some booty TV

397
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,639
and I went through the OC Weekly to get

398
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,010
ads for the sports programming I was

399
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,889
doing and there was all these cannabis

400
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:23,210
ads I was like oh my god I need to

401
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:24,350
produce a show about weed so it was so

402
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,570
the first instinct wouldn't make money

403
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,180
but when I started doing my research I

404
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,280
realized no way we're like the Jackie

405
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:33,829
Robinson breaking the color barrier and

406
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,689
so we were active as a base and we

407
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:39,860
became an extension of jack harries work

408
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:42,410
food fuel fiber medicine we produced 36

409
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,419
episodes around it for 13 weeks we ran

410
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:47,240
them for 13 weeks and that will be

411
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:49,159
season one rent three seasons we went to

412
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,450
a little bit of a hiatus we've been in

413
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:56,929
hiatus the marketplace is caught up our

414
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:59,390
show is coming back and we're one Jeff

415
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:02,479
Sessions memo away from there not being

416
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:05,000
a PI to be bait I was just denied going

417
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,920
on Direct TV last week we don't show

418
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,410
anyone smoking we don't show you

419
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,170
recreational use of the plant it's like

420
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:15,800
what equipment you're broadcasting vice

421
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:18,170
land that shows Bon Appetit and we two

422
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:20,869
kids but oh that's okay you're taking

423
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,250
their big money from the network but if

424
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:24,198
I want to make a paid programming by

425
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,650
your standards and practices says it's

426
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,500
illegal

427
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,420
we can't Bank is an industry whoo it's

428
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,769
just an article today I said that some

429
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,250
Senate bill where they're going to

430
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:38,839
prohibit marketing on t-shirts so the

431
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:41,450
point is this it is a plant the plant

432
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:43,849
comes first if that wants to be medicine

433
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,380
and patients for sure but the whole

434
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:47,029
reason Canada's was prohibited had

435
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,850
nothing to do with the medicine it with

436
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:51,829
the industrial applications so today

437
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:55,029
those industrial parents don't give a

438
00:17:51,829 --> 00:18:00,099
shit because it's so far antiquated

439
00:17:55,029 --> 00:18:00,099
sands burst pearl Owens no D quarter

440
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:07,160
the point is is that tobacco alcohol and

441
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:09,500
big farm that's the money trail they're

442
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,110
the ones pushing back right now but it

443
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,650
was industry they'd be pushing back - it

444
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:19,119
was paper or nylon who do we think

445
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:22,190
should be giving to us the industry and

446
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,409
simultaneously who should we be giving

447
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,450
to and when I say giving again I'm not

448
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,740
necessarily only speaking about money

449
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,690
I'm speaking about your time I'm

450
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,130
speaking about your brain and I was

451
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,340
speaking about anything that you can

452
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:38,540
give so it's not just financial so that

453
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:41,689
would be the question I would say oh the

454
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:43,879
suits showing up one of us said to me

455
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,490
what do you think of all of us coming

456
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,540
into your industry now and I said that's

457
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,670
what I've been trying to build the

458
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:51,409
biggest army I can build for my entire

459
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,390
life I've been waiting for you what took

460
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,390
you so long I'm glad you're here this

461
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,830
industry is open to everyone and every

462
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,380
characteristic a STONER a Deadhead or

463
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:02,720
whatever there's a place for you but I

464
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,610
just have one request and that is to

465
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,009
remember everybody that made this

466
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:09,909
possible for you to be here and to quit

467
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:13,279
stoner shaming all the people that have

468
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:15,440
paved the way for you to be here all

469
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,269
these so-called stupid stoners or the

470
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,799
reason every one of you is here today

471
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:20,799
they did something right

472
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,429
you know and then we'll we'll welcome

473
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:28,720
you into our industry and happily we

474
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:30,940
want you here

475
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,940
but you know there's so there's that and

476
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,380
then also I always say to every business

477
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,259
that I'm working with I do a lot of

478
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,630
consulting that it's vulgar and obscene

479
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:42,190
for you to try to profit from this

480
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,919
industry if you're not willing to

481
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:47,528
actually contribute to moving the needle

482
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,509
and if you're not willing to have a gift

483
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:50,919
back planned and I don't even want to

484
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:53,798
buy what you're selling

485
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,809
so there's consciousness that I think

486
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:58,269
needs to happen with this type of

487
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:59,918
capitalism I'm not anti capitalism I've

488
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:02,048
been an activist but I believe in a

489
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,210
conscious capitalism because this is a

490
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:06,849
movement of compassion and we're

491
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:10,000
conscious people and we're very you know

492
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:12,158
people were really under estimating the

493
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,220
consumer of those stones on earth as we

494
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,278
can in flattening me or packaging on it

495
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,259
from us know their figured out that

496
00:20:18,278 --> 00:20:23,079
we're left harder than they realize and

497
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:25,000
that we actually care who is behind the

498
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:28,178
brand and how they run their business

499
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,130
and the ethics that they have and how

500
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:32,528
they do their business that's really

501
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,940
important to most consumers in the

502
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:35,950
canvas industry and there are a lot of

503
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,539
servers in shipping so don't ever

504
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,700
underestimate the consumer

505
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:43,129
anyway remember there's still people

506
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,740
sitting in jail for doing what you're

507
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,900
trying to do right now and we know it

508
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:52,930
doesn't Rattata them and I think we also

509
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,930
should never stop trying to give them

510
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,640
the evidence

511
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:04,369
Mary this would resonate over there

512
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,650
Marisa Angie everyone's idea of activism

513
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:10,309
is different from the three-foot rule I

514
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:13,040
mentioned to someone donating money

515
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:15,889
donating their time collecting

516
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,420
signatures receiving the information to

517
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,450
disseminate every one site is different

518
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:22,940
and it all important so giving back and

519
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,200
give s in many different ways but to

520
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,450
meet the evidence thing is really

521
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,220
important because like I was missing

522
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,779
earlier with my show of being Jackie

523
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,470
Robinson breaking the color girl we're

524
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:36,379
being watched people so I mean just

525
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,150
common sense tells you to try to market

526
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:42,970
yourself if you're trading in the tree

527
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:46,550
of your RAM in a responsible fashion not

528
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:48,710
you know marketed kids with the

529
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:50,389
recreational cannabis is great and all

530
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,860
about recreation we should be able to

531
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,680
alter our level of consciousness as

532
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:58,909
human beings but that was beautiful than

533
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:01,759
the prop 215 and patient I have ADHD

534
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,710
that's why I use Janice we're pretty

535
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,900
compassionate Society right if I had to

536
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,870
answer just that simple probably it was

537
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:12,740
okay but Bobby ADHD is all you stoner

538
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:14,239
you don't take this bill so we should

539
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,279
fill the user all those in terms saw

540
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,740
mean we should be able to use herbal

541
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:20,069
medicine

542
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,890
Steve Rasputia for menstrual cramps not

543
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:25,439
just spasticity or Crohn's or he's no

544
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:29,340
debilitating diseases so it slowly

545
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,190
educate the general public re-educate

546
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:34,109
them his Reaper manage mentality went

547
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,299
down eight years ago and per visit

548
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:39,149
everyone's mentality so I don't know how

549
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:41,549
we end it except everybody stands up and

550
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,830
says hey what the fuck this is a herb

551
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:46,500
reasonable to use it so if you donate

552
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:48,149
your money you donate your time and your

553
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,339
city mark yourself as possible

554
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,860
great now I wonder if you could tell us

555
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:54,808
about what you want to talk about the

556
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:58,949
other day with like investment and being

557
00:22:54,808 --> 00:23:00,509
able to second off percentages to go yes

558
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:04,920
I think so

559
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:07,710
I remember an old yeah I love things

560
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:10,289
right now I actually had a company to

561
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:12,630
get into sector and part of my company

562
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:15,629
gives back there's a lot of companies

563
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,550
out there that does I know Jenny gives

564
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,620
you one for one into cancer patients I

565
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:23,369
know there's companies that you give to

566
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:26,009
veterans Miss Mary Jane's an abandoned

567
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:28,678
veterans program you know giving back is

568
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:30,450
really important to me I'm actually part

569
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,670
of the group that I'm proud of and

570
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,370
hopefully my Lexi doesn't take off

571
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,820
Angeles emeralds or Elmo's yeah I did a

572
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:40,129
right there you go and

573
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:41,359
those are back there what are the things

574
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,660
that we've been working on as a

575
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:47,029
community or our dispensary owners is

576
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,130
setting them up with ways that they can

577
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:52,069
give back to the community and it's real

578
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:55,190
simple one of the best ideas that was

579
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:57,919
has been around for a long time is go to

580
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,890
Home Depot pick up one of those barrels

581
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,100
that you chill your drinks in and have a

582
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,870
good Drive we're people bringing

583
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:08,480
non-perishable items and if they bring

584
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:12,229
in ten they get a prequel and you can

585
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,259
donate that food to the hungry see basic

586
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:18,440
things like that is a way to give back

587
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:19,879
to society it doesn't have to be big we

588
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,190
don't have to write checks for hundreds

589
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,280
of thousands of dollars that's not where

590
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:28,279
it starts it starts with the basics is

591
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,710
somebody hungry in need and so that's

592
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:32,289
what I'm at right now with a great group

593
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:34,910
that's in the back I know

594
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:36,829
led task force has a program that

595
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,540
they're putting together two rooms in

596
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:41,149
here somewhere

597
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:43,009
so definitely see Jonathan moving about

598
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:45,980
about some of the stuff that's going on

599
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:48,859
out there how to get back and can I just

600
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:51,860
learn about is what others are asking

601
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:54,289
him about is and what's lately myself

602
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:55,879
included and talking to investors and

603
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:58,369
people are committed to the industry I

604
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,530
know I personally do and I know she's

605
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:03,469
doing it as well which is making sure

606
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:05,230
that out of a hundred percent of the

607
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:08,058
funds that they are going to donate X

608
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:10,989
percent it could be eight seven ten

609
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:14,628
somewhere in that range must go to

610
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:17,419
nonprofit must go to advocacy otherwise

611
00:25:14,628 --> 00:25:19,579
don't want your money because if you're

612
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:21,349
not willing to help this industry then

613
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:25,598
you can profit off of it you're not the

614
00:25:21,348 --> 00:25:28,668
right investor and that's how I live

615
00:25:25,598 --> 00:25:30,499
right now in the show-me kilometer so if

616
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:33,320
he's walking off and I've got a lot of

617
00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:35,450
big investors that want to come in and I

618
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:37,189
want to turn down two of them and where

619
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,169
we get into of and possibly to buy this

620
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,269
piece of property and that's what Jack

621
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:43,700
and I were talking about if they buy it

622
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:45,588
what is their endgame what is their plan

623
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,048
what is we're gonna give me that because

624
00:25:45,588 --> 00:25:51,678
the bottom line is I don't care about

625
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:55,069
money they're the most important thing

626
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:58,009
is to people and also in ermine Brattle

627
00:25:55,069 --> 00:26:00,019
think all of us but also some of us

628
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:02,419
myself included spend time speaking with

629
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:04,429
state and city council members and I can

630
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:05,929
say for my own personal experience that

631
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:08,479
the conversations that I'm having when

632
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:10,429
them are involved in community action

633
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:12,889
are involving and they're don't look at

634
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:15,019
who they're going to license how many

635
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:17,808
licenses and who they're going to choose

636
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:19,638
how to license in their city when they

637
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:22,069
go through the vetting process they're

638
00:26:19,638 --> 00:26:24,798
going to be paying attention to what

639
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:27,319
kind of giving back you do what kind of

640
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,489
programs you may want to create they're

641
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:30,739
going to be looking at that stuff

642
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:31,909
because it's not going to necessarily go

643
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:34,909
to the highest bidder

644
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:37,339
I managed to buy a better too great for

645
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:39,229
money but it doesn't necessarily help

646
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:42,759
the community you might but it might not

647
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:44,798
so when the cities are thinking about

648
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:48,038
license just keep in mind and that's

649
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,598
going to be a factor it's going to be

650
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:52,239
the criteria and you know what I'm all

651
00:26:49,598 --> 00:26:54,668
for it because it's time for us to be

652
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:56,769
able to bring this industry into the

653
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:59,199
into the mainstream let's do it the

654
00:26:56,769 --> 00:27:05,199
right way and show everybody how awesome

655
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:07,119
Canada's people walk right well yeah the

656
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:08,739
one I want to make it and that's the

657
00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:10,928
gelled earlier dimension for entire

658
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:13,869
space here in LA I live in Orange County

659
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,699
on a little tunnel sets of beach once a

660
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:18,368
lot of time we have five collectives in

661
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:20,079
our little unincorporated Hamlet who's

662
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:23,588
beautiful I was patient number one

663
00:27:20,078 --> 00:27:26,528
within my street unincorporated see what

664
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:27,578
block there and now there's not one city

665
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:30,489
in Orange County

666
00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:33,729
Sam Sandman where there's legal

667
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:35,318
collectives to offer San Diego County

668
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:38,889
Savannah where was the salute

669
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:41,709
interesting it's also all delivery

670
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:44,738
services all black market so it's a big

671
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:47,190
problem and I think this whole of your

672
00:27:44,739 --> 00:27:50,619
message acuity got it would be activism

673
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:52,149
we've gotta punch the conversation we've

674
00:27:50,618 --> 00:27:54,269
got mister conversation to the

675
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:58,088
politicians we've gotta push the

676
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:59,679
conversation to the City Council's and

677
00:27:58,088 --> 00:28:01,898
we've got us about this reefer madness

678
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,059
mentality but we know it's not

679
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:07,538
technically alcohol is more dangerous

680
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:10,928
the cannabis is literature from every

681
00:28:07,538 --> 00:28:13,388
corner yet we can't have a dispensary

682
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:15,609
but part of me dispenses for profit we

683
00:28:13,388 --> 00:28:19,588
can't have an optical activity of

684
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:22,138
patients to share medicine that's lunacy

685
00:28:19,588 --> 00:28:26,708
married a lot talk to you about

686
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:29,048
technology as we are in the social age

687
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:31,719
and we are using we're taking our

688
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:34,658
messages socially how do you think

689
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:37,058
technology is helping and how is it may

690
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:39,440
be hurting our mad look at the everand

691
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:43,668
elder I've already had a low

692
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,830
with it as you know because with one of

693
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:50,149
the things that obviously is the number

694
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:53,720
to medical probably really one of the

695
00:28:50,148 --> 00:28:56,329
best tools that helps really careful a

696
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,089
lot of our movement but at the same time

697
00:28:56,329 --> 00:29:01,579
what I've also seen is like Facebook

698
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:04,339
activists we're all I think that they

699
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:06,319
have to do is like post a link in their

700
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:08,449
an activist you know and I say come on

701
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:11,178
it takes a little bit more than that

702
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:13,009
I appreciate that that helps but it's

703
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:15,500
not enough and we need to really

704
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:18,589
motivate people to do more and to show

705
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,720
up and have their voice heard and to and

706
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:23,269
I know people are going to do this with

707
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,649
their actual voice anymore but call your

708
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:29,899
local representatives and talk to them

709
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:32,349
and the text and send the email it just

710
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:35,719
goes into a digital file of bits and

711
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:37,969
bytes that they don't they can't really

712
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,798
keep that registered when you write a

713
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,319
letter and you make a phone call there's

714
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:46,038
more human connection and tell your

715
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:47,839
story telling how is this change your

716
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:50,480
life or what's happening to you because

717
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,369
they listen to those stories and you

718
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,190
know a long time ago yes you work for

719
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:56,439
The Oprah Winfrey Show and I have never

720
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,630
million years she needs to read all that

721
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,120
mail with all that mail would come in

722
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:03,010
and she herself did not is true but she

723
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:04,809
had pile of the people that we sort

724
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:07,269
through the mail looking for those

725
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:09,549
stories and they would synopsis

726
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:12,549
everything and give her a report of all

727
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:14,889
the remaining stories for a person that

728
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:17,470
got as much mail as she got amazed at

729
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,940
how much she actually did read but you

730
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,670
know it was important to have that

731
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,620
personal story so tell me your story and

732
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:26,170
tell us to the right people because they

733
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:28,659
need to hear it and they're not watching

734
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:30,550
your Facebook beat so tell us to the

735
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,960
people who matter that's one of the

736
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:35,139
easiest things you could do I write

737
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,539
letters all the time how I started as an

738
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,460
activist when I was 8 years old my third

739
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:40,869
grade teacher said we're going to do a

740
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,279
project today write a letter to the

741
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:45,099
president and that was the first time I

742
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:47,740
realized I could do this and I got a

743
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:50,049
letter back and then that's what started

744
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,880
this whole thing really because

745
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:53,769
eventually I realize I could do that to

746
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:57,910
talk about marijuana ejectives very

747
00:30:53,769 --> 00:31:00,309
short about teenagers but my point is it

748
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:02,320
got a response and it's something I

749
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:04,299
continue to do to this day because I

750
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,039
can't show up to everything there's so

751
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:08,950
many things to show up to a hot ass a

752
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:10,869
lot maybe I served everything I can so

753
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:14,440
we can't all show up to everything show

754
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:15,969
up as often as you can and write letters

755
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,220
and make those

756
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:23,480
so it's a continuous conversation

757
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:25,670
so how do we choose what they were

758
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,130
donate our time or our money to other

759
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:30,650
organizations how do we choose how do we

760
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:33,740
know which ones to you know we've got n

761
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:34,910
P P P P a normal all these organizations

762
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,210
and they're all doing wonderful things

763
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:41,360
how how do we choose how do we figure

764
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:43,730
out what we can do and and you know and

765
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,500
make a decision because everyone has to

766
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,980
give their hearts right and we want a

767
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,839
pie

768
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,789
it has to be they Bradley looking it no

769
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,549
I don't know how that is support my

770
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:56,149
television program at five Edison but we

771
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:58,039
do have a pretty loud microphone you

772
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:01,850
know one of the way that we don't choose

773
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:03,829
is to look at the organization it's very

774
00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:05,089
important there's a lot of organizations

775
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:07,909
that have popped their head up in the

776
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:11,659
last couple years saying if you join me

777
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:13,580
I will guarantee you a license just give

778
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:18,490
me ten thousand or thirty thousand

779
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:20,569
dollars these people how I look at it is

780
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:23,029
what are they doing what is the

781
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:26,539
organization really doing out there what

782
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:28,730
are they giving back it's most important

783
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:31,460
to look at what an organization is doing

784
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:33,380
and how they're giving back because all

785
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,299
these organizations even if they sit

786
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:38,390
there and say we're not making a dime

787
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:41,149
they're making a dime okay there's this

788
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:47,330
line you know and the bottom line is

789
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:49,490
what they're doing yeah oh yeah well I

790
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:51,579
mean I'm at these big orders these big

791
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:53,720
few organizations let's put it that way

792
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:55,460
they've been able right but the ones

793
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,769
that are working on the front line that

794
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:01,039
are on the ground every day many of the

795
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:02,779
business review I read yesterday we they

796
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,609
all need help doing all they need

797
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:09,490
volunteers and they need funding

798
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:09,490
although how do we get that - that was

799
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:14,619
there's so many different ways to give

800
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:15,159
and you know but I think what we're here

801
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:16,659
for

802
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,900
as a group is because we're interested

803
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:22,240
in in being entrepreneurs or working in

804
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,830
this industry and I think really the

805
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,120
most important thing we can do as an

806
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:27,970
industry is hold each other accountable

807
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,589
to certain sets of ethics and support

808
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,470
the people that are supporting us

809
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:34,449
because we can't drive as a business or

810
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,610
an industry we're not willing to invest

811
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,830
in creating the business environment

812
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:41,139
that's going to allow your business to

813
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:43,599
succeed which is why you need to support

814
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:46,450
people like MVP and BPA and the people

815
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:48,519
that are making the love possible for

816
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:51,430
you to be in business at all

817
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:53,470
so that I think is why we're here

818
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:55,150
there's a lot of different ways to get

819
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,680
it there's a lot of different you know

820
00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:00,009
things that you can all be doing I mean

821
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:02,799
I was poor in college for the supporter

822
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:05,980
community but yet I found time to raise

823
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,648
money and to get our voices heard and to

824
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,909
put on event and you know sometimes you

825
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:12,339
can find the money if you're really

826
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:15,700
willing and if you're going to try to

827
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:17,919
turn a profit I think you should invest

828
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:24,789
in your own best interest by supporting

829
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:26,739
the movement as well I want to fall on

830
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:30,398
the IE point it was the original premise

831
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:31,359
you know IP is like technology mary said

832
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:32,949
you know they're not to be watching your

833
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:36,849
Facebook feed now I think it'll be their

834
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:39,029
snapchat or Instagram feeds social media

835
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:41,648
is discouraged but it's also very

836
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,050
amazing ly powerful medium that we have

837
00:34:41,648 --> 00:34:45,079
to

838
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:51,350
the internet social media so you can't

839
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:53,960
discount it we so I think putting your

840
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:56,599
message out there where the most people

841
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,030
can see it is definitely a start to

842
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,549
helping you change public opinion you

843
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:03,740
change public policy the politicians are

844
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:05,420
behind the curve the citizens now but

845
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:07,789
the politicians want votes

846
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,440
so if enough citizens say a as well you

847
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:11,750
know people are sheep we know we are you

848
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,250
take away their alcohol they get pissed

849
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,170
well it should be may take aware of

850
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,340
cannabis we're going to get this one of

851
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:18,740
the things I think is also really

852
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,750
interesting and I'm sure that when Karen

853
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:26,029
is appear so be able to speak to this as

854
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:27,380
well for a long time as the Marijuana

855
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,740
Policy Project we're used to work with

856
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,150
Karen we were we were funded Mimi by

857
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:34,219
philanthropists who are just really

858
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,019
generous people who cared about freedom

859
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:39,589
and wanted to support civil liberties

860
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:42,170
not so much by the industry as the

861
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:44,450
industry kept growing and becoming more

862
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:46,309
and more wealthy there came a point

863
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:48,439
where a lot of the philanthropists were

864
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:50,480
starting to look around and say those

865
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,000
things are getting rich and they're not

866
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,829
putting any money in we don't really

867
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,320
want to be the ones supporting this

868
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:58,179
industry by ourselves anymore we really

869
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,730
want them to

870
00:35:58,179 --> 00:36:02,500
when you start contributing and the

871
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:05,289
philanthropist started pulling back some

872
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,659
of their money and their contributions

873
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:09,369
and the more we kept putting pressure on

874
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:11,139
the industry to give back there was

875
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:13,778
always an excuse there's like we're not

876
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:15,368
making it up and I get it where you know

877
00:36:13,778 --> 00:36:16,480
a lot of people really struggle you're

878
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:18,400
either going to rob through your key

879
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,900
trading or the sacraments taking it all

880
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,750
and there's a lot of different things

881
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:25,778
that get in the way of getting rich off

882
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:28,838
the industry but like I said if I could

883
00:36:25,778 --> 00:36:30,608
find a way to contribute when I court

884
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:34,028
and college I think we can all buy the

885
00:36:30,608 --> 00:36:36,119
way we should find a way but what's

886
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:38,829
really interesting is the fact that

887
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,079
since X happens we've really built this

888
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:42,700
industry when I talk to my friends with

889
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,278
all the advocacy groups they tell me

890
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:47,019
that this donations are not still coming

891
00:36:45,278 --> 00:36:48,730
from industry they're still mostly

892
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:50,829
coming from philanthropists and with the

893
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,500
same people that were supporting us all

894
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:56,170
along are still mostly the people still

895
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,179
supporting us and we're seeing more from

896
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,980
the industry but not nearly as much as

897
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:01,750
you would think so that's what one of

898
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,400
the other things I think we call this

899
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,199
group together because we kind of need

900
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,789
to hold each other accountable and do

901
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:12,189
better because people think that this is

902
00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:13,900
inevitable veces the laws are going to

903
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,460
change and that legalization is

904
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,579
happening and you don't really have to

905
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:20,090
do very much but I remember Seventeen's

906
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:21,800
when we thought it was a member

907
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,930
going to happen and then they were

908
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,000
discriminating across the state Jimmy

909
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:28,279
Carter was on board and then all of a

910
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,840
sudden we got Reagan and he said

911
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,800
marijuana was the most dangerous drug

912
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,500
known to man

913
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,140
and then we started seeing some of the

914
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,570
worst drug war prohibition that we have

915
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:41,119
ever seen I mean he escalated it beyond

916
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:42,740
belief so you can't get complacent and

917
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,059
you can't be someone else is going to do

918
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:45,769
it and we can't just think it's

919
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:47,449
automatic you know I remember when

920
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:48,710
people were trying to come in after you

921
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:51,109
how to get in the industry

922
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:53,210
I said volunteer getting all the

923
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:55,070
movement that's the best way to learn

924
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,570
cuz you can't get a course on where the

925
00:37:55,070 --> 00:38:02,030
college where you can't now but you

926
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:03,800
couldn't send so you know giving back

927
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,600
this one of the best things you can do

928
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,490
is that still what are the best things

929
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:12,650
you can do and the best thing to do is

930
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:14,539
to just get involved really what I'm

931
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:16,940
saying is this isn't a career this is a

932
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:20,000
calling for me but it is it became a

933
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,780
career too but once we kind of start

934
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,909
with that

935
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,830
if you come so effective in your soul

936
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:26,569
that there's nothing else that you can

937
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:28,400
do you can't even walk away from it even

938
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:30,170
with the industry and heart it's and

939
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,690
it's been really really hard

940
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:35,420
a lot of the price or the left or holy

941
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:38,119
fingers we're getting but a lot easier

942
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,250
road to go down now and we have all

943
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,289
these amazing people to think but don't

944
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:44,929
get too comfortable because it can

945
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:46,579
change at any moment we don't know what

946
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:49,699
Jeff Sessions was going to do even

947
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:51,480
though he doesn't scare me at all so it

948
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:54,449
will adjust

949
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,240
whatever happens it stills areas

950
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:59,039
prospects and people used to say to me I

951
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:01,589
can't give you the industry commence

952
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:04,980
illegal now the argument is I can't get

953
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:06,690
it I can't contribute because it's you

954
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,780
know it's legal now I don't have to do

955
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:12,240
anything you know so there's obviously

956
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,890
that's not the case on either side so we

957
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:15,329
don't have a lot of work to do and I

958
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:17,250
think that says that the key here is

959
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:19,289
understanding that cannabis is not just

960
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:21,750
a lifestyle Kansas is not just a

961
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:24,360
medicine cannabis as much as the culture

962
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:26,909
cannabis is also regulations and laws

963
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,829
and policies and you can't separate them

964
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:30,960
if you want to have commercial activity

965
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:33,090
so and I'm assuming that everybody in

966
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,650
the room is somehow a mold commercial

967
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,030
activity whether you have want to get a

968
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,230
license or you just want to remain an

969
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,630
advocate you're still in that commercial

970
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:41,789
world so understanding that those two

971
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:43,380
things really can't live apart if you're

972
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:45,329
just living in the lifestyle culture

973
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,829
you're in the consumer land nobody care

974
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:49,289
that you're making any money if you're

975
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:51,329
just living in policy land that's kind

976
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:52,829
of boring so it's really it's really the

977
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:54,179
two together that's what makes the magic

978
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:56,069
and I think that's what we need to

979
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:57,389
continue to focus on so I think what I'd

980
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:00,930
like to do is open it up for some

981
00:39:57,389 --> 00:40:03,239

California normal the main normal office

1029

there's a lot of different normal

1030
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:38,559
organizations out there but because my

1031
00:42:36,608 --> 00:42:40,929
first detainment was getting petitions

1032
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:45,819
with normal that's always been in my

1033
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:48,129
heart right there yeah yeah yeah I would

1034
00:42:45,818 --> 00:42:51,849
have to get I thought some hand as

1035
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:55,568
always see you normally see on earlier

1036
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:57,519
another I held your name use everybody

1037
00:42:55,568 --> 00:42:58,179
my name is Morocco thank you for your

1038
00:42:57,518 --> 00:43:01,719
time

1039
00:42:58,179 --> 00:43:03,879
hey so I get to have a quick question

1040
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:05,259
you know it's on or maybe not so quick

1041
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,400
but it's on the question of community

1042
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:11,679
engagement so the first one is you know

1043
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,389
one of the things that I know that we're

1044
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,368
doing just you know for my visits in

1045
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:17,230
terms of community age with is we're

1046
00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:20,289
plugging into all of our local civic

1047
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:21,789
leadership programs most cities in the

1048
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:23,079
Las Vegas area have some type of

1049
00:43:21,789 --> 00:43:26,170
leadership program

1050
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:27,729
to either chamber or through some big

1051
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,318
office economic development something

1052
00:43:27,728 --> 00:43:31,629
like that that gives you kind of like

1053
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:33,278
this fast path to understand the players

1054
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:35,499
you know and understand the policies and

1055
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:37,389
what works there so for I guess the

1056
00:43:35,498 --> 00:43:39,248
Canadian carbon took my first part is

1057
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:40,838
what your guys's views were and with

1058
00:43:39,248 --> 00:43:42,879
that type of engagement in depending

1059
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:45,278
pointers you guys are talk about how we

1060
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,809
craft that engagement once you're

1061
00:43:45,278 --> 00:43:48,369
getting so close with the people through

1062
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:50,619
a leadership program like that the

1063
00:43:48,369 --> 00:43:53,200
second part to my question and I get a

1064
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:55,930
little bit more so boxy but you know to

1065
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:58,179
be to talk about non industry specific

1066
00:43:55,929 --> 00:43:59,739
chairs you know for instance something

1067
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:01,899
that we know all of us whether or not

1068
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:02,829
here in cannabis housing is a really big

1069
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,509
problem in LA County

1070
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:07,180
homelessness is one of the biggest

1071
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:08,259
issues are kind of based apparently what

1072
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:10,259
about partnering with groups like

1073
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:12,579
Habitat for Humanity you know kind of

1074
00:44:10,259 --> 00:44:14,108
normalizing our charge scheme so that we

1075
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:15,910
aren't just staying within our limbs we

1076
00:44:14,108 --> 00:44:17,409
are reaching out we are sowing people

1077
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:21,068
who do care about you and you care about

1078
00:44:17,409 --> 00:44:23,228
reducing I'll jump in really quick and

1079
00:44:21,068 --> 00:44:25,509
say that that's an excellent idea and I

1080
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:27,338
am glad you brought that up because we

1081
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:29,440
don't just need to give to archanis or

1082
00:44:27,338 --> 00:44:32,139
organizations although they need help we

1083
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,849
also want to show the whole community

1084
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:35,768
that we could give back and we can help

1085
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:37,359
support them as well so I think

1086
00:44:35,768 --> 00:44:38,649
something like how to have to marinate

1087
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,259
any of those kinds of things are great

1088
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:42,789
like Diane and her quote earlier we're

1089
00:44:41,259 --> 00:44:45,190
talking about or Kristin will talk about

1090
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:47,499
firefighters and you know others as

1091
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:50,528
other organizations and groups that are

1092
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:52,448
involved in directly with cannabis or

1093
00:44:50,528 --> 00:44:55,119
not that you could just give back really

1094
00:44:52,449 --> 00:44:56,829
it's really there's a rule you can just

1095
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,890
give back what you I think what we're

1096
00:44:56,829 --> 00:45:02,019
all saying is that you should write if

1097
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:04,690
you're if you're a collective owner or

1098
00:45:02,018 --> 00:45:07,808
organizer of a collective I think it's

1099
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:09,999
huge importance Joan and mention alluded

1100
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:12,278
to it earlier work with your local City

1101
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:14,288
Council Luke would work with your city

1102
00:45:12,278 --> 00:45:16,208
community and take a proceeds of your

1103
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:18,400
donations and give them back to the

1104
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:20,348
community that builds goodwill all

1105
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,389
across the board so every collective

1106
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:23,580
owner in my opinion

1107
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:25,789
party organizer of each collective

1108
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:29,429
should work with their local City

1109
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:31,610
Council to build it will through giving

1110
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:31,609
back

1111
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:41,990
they were always going to be coming and

1112
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:48,570
run into that path of changing but there

1113
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:50,869
have been a community organizations or

1114
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:53,700
they said that they can take our money

1115
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:56,190
so they're scoping work to be done there

1116
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:58,939
and you know I think that every industry

1117
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:01,500
involves with danger

1118
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:04,250
before comfortable thinking it but that

1119
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,250
also works

1120
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,818
Oh later

1121
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,610
yeah 100% on that I agree with you Mary

1122
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:17,710
because we've tried to give money to

1123
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:20,380
certain community leaders and they won't

1124
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:21,010
accept it because it is cannabis what we

1125
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,289
found

1126
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:26,320
you know besides taking good donations

1127
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:29,230
when I did have a open dispensary was to

1128
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,000
right now buy lunch tickets take a

1129
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:33,699
couple hundred dollars go down to a

1130
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,639
middle school and buy lunch tickets and

1131
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:39,189
then say it's a donation and don'ts

1132
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:41,739
maintain the organization you know if

1133
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:43,360
you're if you're only there's donations

1134
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:45,519
work two ways one is you're trying to

1135
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,430
make give a donation to get your name

1136
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:49,900
out there the other way is you're making

1137
00:46:48,429 --> 00:46:51,659
a donation to make the world a better

1138
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:54,039
place okay

1139
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:55,690
making the world a better place works a

1140
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:57,789
lot better because eventually they find

1141
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:59,710
out where it came from and when they

1142
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:01,630
find out they're like oh they didn't try

1143
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:04,360
to get their name another one is

1144
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:06,250
community cleanups if you live in an

1145
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,170
area that has a lot of graffiti a lot of

1146
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:11,260
trash things like that and you have a

1147
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:13,210
business in that area take one day a

1148
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,640
month with your employees and maybe some

1149
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:18,429
volunteers and go out and help clean

1150
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:20,889
that community that goes a long way in

1151
00:47:18,429 --> 00:47:23,649
the community eyes you know we just had

1152
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:25,690
a fire up in Santa Clarita yesterday one

1153
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:28,240
of the things that a lot of us did was

1154
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:30,220
take water to the firefighters and get

1155
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:32,919
to the front line because we're within a

1156
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:35,259
mile away you know on three and four day

1157
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,480
fires it's nice to set up a tent and

1158
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:40,030
cook meals and bring those meals to

1159
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,159
people you know there's many ways to do

1160
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:45,910
this where you don't have to be in the

1161
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:48,519
limelight court but it works taking care

1162
00:47:45,909 --> 00:47:50,859
of people comes back to you tenfold

1163
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:53,679
you know seeing Mary triggered something

1164
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:58,650
for me mutual friend of ours did a movie

1165
00:47:53,679 --> 00:48:01,509
never were close and at yeah Melissa and

1166
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:03,400
there's many activists out there that

1167
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:07,560
need our help from people that are in

1168
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:10,480
here okay like the Richard Eastman's the

1169
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:12,340
Melissa's people like that and if you

1170
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,840
see if you know these people reach out

1171
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,940
to them

1172
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,220
because sometimes just reaching out to

1173
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,900
them helps them throughout their day and

1174
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:19,769
I just wanted to put that part out there

1175
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,539

1178
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,860
very controversial guy and you know he

1179
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:31,949
was called a bully as all sorts of

1180
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:34,079
things but at the end of the day his

1181
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:35,819
bullshit filter was pretty good and what

1182
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,909
