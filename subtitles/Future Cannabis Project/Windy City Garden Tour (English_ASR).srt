1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,520
what's up everybody this is windy city

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,839
garden

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,240
um so

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,200
um i'm a new grower first let's get that

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,400
out of the way

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,518
um i am a medical patient based out of

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,039
illinois

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,240
um they recently changed the law to

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,199
allow uh recrea or medical grow um and

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,320
so i got my

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,760
my license to do that and um so that's

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,160
what this garden is is

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,920
this is a caretaker garden um that i'm

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,880
helping another medical patient with

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,679
um so you can see what we got cooking in

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,040
here just

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,119
doing some little maintenance on these

18
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,399
guys um

19
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,718
so yeah we'll walk you through the

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,558
property we used to have five plants

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,399
actually we had a problem with root

22
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,679
aphids earlier this year

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,198
we'd started off in this bed and

24
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,878
out of the five plants that we'd put in

25
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,320
the bed the root aphids killed

26
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,439
everything but two of the plants we

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,719
ended up treating with

28
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,558
nematodes and dr zymes treatments

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,759
and we ended up clearing the beds and we

30
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,358
still were able to save two of the

31
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,198
plants

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,879
this is the remnants of one and i'll get

33
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,478
into why it's like that

34
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,478
in just a second if you want to lay any

35
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,719
bets as to why

36
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,000
that's what we've got left of a plant

37
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,719
submit your

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,040
submit your answers now um and then this

39
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,438
was the other plant that we had in here

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,118
uh this is an acapulco gold and we had

41
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:23,599
pulled it out of the bed put it into new

42
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,079
soil

43
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,640
treated all the soil with nematodes and

44
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,920
um

45
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,719
dr zimes and uh we got rid of we got

46
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,719
past the aphids problem

47
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,798
uh up until this week we actually had a

48
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,239
full

49
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,439
the biggest bush that we had was this

50
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,118
one right here and it came out i mean

51
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,559
we had stake marks all the way out to

52
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,560
here which is about four feet off the

53
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,640
bed maybe three feet off the bed

54
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,118
and uh had full trellis systems on it it

55
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,478
was massive it was gonna be

56
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,319
i mean i don't know a lot this is my

57
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:57,840
first season but it was going to be

58
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,839
in the pounds yieldage for sure

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,840
what we're working with now though is

60
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:05,039
for uh four plants

61
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,719
these are critical plants from

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,039
seed stalkers based out of spain uh

63
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,318
so three of them are the are clones of

64
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,519
that

65
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:19,280
um and then this is an acapulco gold

66
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,439
um and yeah this is uh

67
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,800
this is what we've got for our garden um

68
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,878
the one that was right here was actually

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,080
a bag seed

70
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:30,239
and uh you know so not surprising

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,519
uh if that gives anybody else any any

72
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,759
more tips why i guess

73
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,879
i'll just say it uh that plant ended up

74
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,399
herming

75
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:41,039
and yeah so we had to cut it

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,480
because it started to seed itself um and

77
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,639
i've been doing some inspection on these

78
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,238
plants to see

79
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,359
uh if they've been seated at all and

80
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,120
some of them look like they might have

81
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,200
got in touch with pollen somebody said

82
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,039
to look for brown

83
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,318
brown pistol hairs which would indicate

84
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,318
pollination and there are definitely

85
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,479
some on some of these plants so

86
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,789
we'll see hopefully the damage was

87
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,639
somewhat contained but it's hard to say

88
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:05,199
[Music]

89
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,399
we're growing in an organic super soil

90
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,560
out here

91
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,680
um with a lot of down-to-earth

92
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,560
amendments

93
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,360
really love the shape of these plants

94
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,360
looks really nice

95
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:23,439
focus these are 15 gallon containers

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,200
um with you know blood meal kelp meal

97
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:31,439
lang banite seibert guano uh

98
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:33,679
alfalfa meal insect frass

99
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,479
all sorts of amendments dropped into

100
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,319
there

101
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,598
and yeah they're doing pretty well i

102
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,839
would say

103
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,759
we started transitioning to flour on

104
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,920
these three plants

105
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,598
um at the very beginning of august i was

106
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,238
very surprised to see how far along they

107
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,399
got

108
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,080
the very beginning of august oops there

109
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,920
we go

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,959
um and

111
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:59,039
this one this acapulco gold i think

112
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,719
because it's got that deep sativa nature

113
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,318
to it it's uh

114
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,598
it's waiting for things to get closer

115
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,919
probably to the 11 and 11 hour cycle

116
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,000
so we'll see how much later it takes

117
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,199
until she really starts to

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,799
to flower up but so yeah that's what

119
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,319
we're working with

120
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,358
um four of the five plants that we

121
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,560
had started with uh about halfway

122
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,799
through the season

123
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,199
uh we had killed three we had lost three

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,639
uh that were also backseat actually

125
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,720
um and

126
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,000
you know uh turns out that was probably

127
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,680
for the best because

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,240
that bag seed was uh was a herm

129
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,360
so had some her hermit hermaphroditic

130
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,120
tendencies

131
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,639
so yeah in terms of

132
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,639
pest management since we got past the

133
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,240
root aphids we've just been deploying uh

134
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,840
beneficial insects

135
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,478
um we were using neem up until flower

136
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,039
but

137
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,918
then i saw the um the talk with scott

138
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,840
scamnis

139
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,680
scott scamness i'm i'm sure i'm

140
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,679
butchering his name uh where he talked

141
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,840
about how the azerachmann

142
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,120
and nimoy was a problem so we cut that

143
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,799
out and we went

144
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,319
basically right to beneficial insects at

145
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
that point so we've got ladybugs we've

146
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,360
got

147
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,478
green lace wings which you can see down

148
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,919
here

149
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:21,680
we've got trichogama trichograma

150
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:25,839
um parasitic

151
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,840
wasps and um

152
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,079
and assassin bugs so we've kind of got a

153
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,560
full assortment of

154
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,839
of beneficial insects um that are in

155
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,360
here right now

156
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,439
and uh hopefully that protects us from

157
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
caterpillars and any other would be

158
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,759
passed

159
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,080
uh until we can finish the season

160
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,000
um yeah so this is again this is a

161
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,319
caretaker outdoor patch

162
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,399
that i'm helping somebody with and in

163
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,599
just a second i'll show you my indoor

164
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:57,038
let's see genetics critical

165
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,240
from seed stalkers acapulco gold from

166
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:59,759
barney's farm

167
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,680
critical from seed stalkers critical

168
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,680
from seed stalkers uh they're just

169
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,519
clones of each other so these are all

170
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,038
the same plant uh it wasn't you know

171
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,198
that i picked out a particularly good

172
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,519
pheno it was literally my first time

173
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,120
growing and um you know you google where

174
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,879
to get seeds and

175
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,120
you order some seeds so it was really

176
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,639
like that simple and now that i'm like

177
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,478
a little further into it i wish that i

178
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,478
had gotten maybe better you know

179
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,918
quote unquote american better american

180
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,519
genetics or something that's maybe more

181
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,639
aligned with um

182
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,918
where i'm growing uh maybe like breeders

183
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,120
out of michigan

184
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,279
would have been maybe a good place to go

185
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,120
or massachusetts

186
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,799
just in terms of finishing dates and all

187
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,079
that kind of stuff um

188
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,918
and also stuff that's well suited for uh

189
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,680
you know in october that can get wet or

190
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,839
uh or cold

191
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,600
but um didn't know about that at the

192
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,279
time didn't do enough research kind of

193
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,720
just ordered seeds and

194
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,239
uh and off we went and um you know next

195
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080
season i think i'm going to go in with a

196
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,879
better plan

197
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,279
but this has been a really fun learning

198
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,399
and

199
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:06,079
uh i guess pun not intended growing

200
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,758
uh experience so yeah

201
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,199
um in illinois we're legally allowed to

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,720
grow five plants

203
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,478
uh with a medical license and um

204
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,639
so now we're down to the four sadly

205
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,360
because we lost this one it was a

206
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,199
yeah it was a hermaphrodite so just

207
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,240
beware of bag seed man test it out

208
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,520
before you run it

209
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,319
full time um and hopefully it didn't get

210
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,399
too much to the rest of our crop because

211
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,759
those seeds are going to be useless

212
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,839
really um so yeah

213
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,759
here's the outdoor let me know if you

214
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,159
have any questions and uh

215
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,680
i'll show you the door in just a second

216
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,280
so i'll take you into the cave in just a

217
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,560
second but i figured that we might start

218
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,079
out here so that we can talk about sort

219
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,598
of what i'm i'm growing

220
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,359
all organically using a lot of

221
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,680
down-to-earth um

222
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,680
amendments and you can see what i got

223
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,400
working with here is um some neem seed

224
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,598
meal

225
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,679
gypsum for calcium um

226
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,519
we've got just an all-purpose 444 which

227
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,639
is a blend of all of this stuff

228
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,598
some humic acids this is um azomite

229
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,439
right here

230
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,159
um which is from micronutrients from

231
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,000
what i understand here's kelp meal

232
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,280
and here's langbanite which is a high

233
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,918
potassium

234
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,878
source here's some alfalfa meal blood

235
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,318
meal

236
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,960
um seabird guano um

237
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,240
crabmeal then some combination of all of

238
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,638
these are in my

239
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,000
um in in what was in the outdoor and

240
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,120
what's in the indoor

241
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,719
um it's been pretty good i was looking

242
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,000
for a system where i would basically

243
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,159
build the soil

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,080
and then all i would have to do is add

245
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,838
teas and water occasionally

246
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,360
and that's pretty well um the direction

247
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,839
that i've gone in i've really enjoyed it

248
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,720
it's been

249
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,680
fairly easy um i'm growing in three

250
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,639
gallon bags

251
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,319
um for most of my stuff um at least on

252
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,240
the indoor the outdoor is obviously

253
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,399
bigger it's 15 gallons um and then we're

254
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,000
doing occasional earthworm casting teas

255
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:01,519
along with this is recharge

256
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,360
from real growers so

257
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,278
infusing our microbe microbiology

258
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,519
and microbes into the soil to regulate

259
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,039
ph so i can just water in regular water

260
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,200
in between those

261
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,480
and we're also adding in occasionally

262
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,278
epsom salts

263
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,278
and silica

264
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,720
the actual bags of these live over at

265
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
the outdoor which is why

266
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,879
so the way that the law works is kind of

267
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,360
silly you can only have five plants

268
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,958
per property it's not even per medical

269
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,320
patient so if you have two medical

270
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,000
patients that live under the same room

271
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,200
you still only have five plants total in

272
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,720
the house which is just like

273
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,560
it doesn't make any sense to me it seems

274
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,759
like a poorly written law in michigan

275
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,119
you can have 12

276
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,200
recreationally like i just don't

277
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,759
understand why you know

278
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,278
um but in any event the law changed in

279
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,319
january officially on the first of the

280
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,320
year

281
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,839
and in the recreational law they

282
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,360
included the provision for home growth

283
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,560
for medical patients and that's what

284
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
inspired me to get

285
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,399
uh to grow my own uh and that's what led

286
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,600
me down the rabbit hole so really i got

287
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,879
started after getting my

288
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,639
my card um i got started in

289
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,240
march and basically started acquiring

290
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,000
all of this stuff doing research on the

291
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,440
internet we popped bag seed and then i

292
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,679
ordered the other plants and we'll talk

293
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,560
about that in just a second

294
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,838
under here i've got my water which is

295
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,679
basically just tap water that i'm

296
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,800
aerating the chlorine out of using these

297
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,159
air pumps

298
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,078
and then i've got this bigger air pump

299
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,519
for making compost teas while actually

300
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,559
earthworm casting teas

301
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,759
with recharge um to inoculate the the

302
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,278
soil with

303
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,720
along with some macro nutrients and some

304
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,000
micronutrients like i'll throw in some

305
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,440
calcium and some

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,440
um and some azomite along with some

307
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,480
phosphorus and and potassium for

308
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,839
um and i'll and i'll try to make it you

309
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,278
know i don't have

310
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,720
um i don't have a microscope

311
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,799
to really see what i'm getting into it

312
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,360
but what i understand and maybe this is

313
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,919
like

314
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,720
you know bro science maybe it's not is

315
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,000
that if you

316
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,160
use earthworm castings and you and you

317
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,559
go for more than 24 hours in a compost

318
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,838
tea you wind up with a more fungally

319
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,518
dominated

320
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,160
compost tea generally speaking

321
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,879
you know fungally dominated compost teas

322
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,000
are good

323
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:17,120
for uh for flowering cycle which is what

324
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
we're in uh in all of these plants that

325
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,600
are in here

326
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,120
here's the two by four tent that i've

327
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,800
got um again

328
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,480
started this in march so i've just been

329
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,838
trying to acquire equipment over the the

330
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,000
course of the pandemic basically

331
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,279
um these are some autoflowers that i

332
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,799
started

333
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,320
86 days ago um and

334
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,000
you know they've been fine but they're

335
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,278
finicky i feel like autoflowers it's

336
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,078
like if you don't get everything right

337
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,240
and veg

338
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,759
and then you flip into flour um and

339
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,079
everything's not right like

340
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,600
you your yield's gonna suffer your

341
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:48,719
potency will probably suffer

342
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,600
like i just don't know that it's the

343
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,399
most in one way it's efficient because

344
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,480
you could do a

345
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,480
perpetual cycle of autoflowers it would

346
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,079
start to cost a lot in seed

347
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,360
but from a home grower's perspective i

348
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,120
think that that's one method that you

349
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,600
could do once you get your system dialed

350
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,519
in so that you're really good

351
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,879
and that you're not wasting any moment

352
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,560
of veg

353
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,159
or any moment of flower so i think you

354
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,958
need to be really dialed in to work with

355
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,439
autoflowers

356
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,719
successfully um i think in the future

357
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,920
i'm gonna work with

358
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,120
photo periods just because there's a

359
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,278
little bit more graze to it there's a

360
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,039
little bit more of like if you mess up

361
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,799
uh you know you still have time to like

362
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,319
correct mistakes and veg before you flip

363
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,799
into flour

364
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,360
these are the critical uh plants this is

365
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,719
the same

366
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,560
this is the mother of the plants that

367
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,680
are out in the outdoor right now

368
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,679
um pretty nice growth

369
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,039
this is the first seed that i popped and

370
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,078
i decided that it was time to throw it

371
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,278
into flower

372
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,958
um because next time on the the flip of

373
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,879
this tent what i really want to do is i

374
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,359
really want to do a proper

375
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,559
pheno hunt so i've got a pack of 14

376
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,680
seeds

377
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,199
that i that i'm going to be running once

378
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,199
everything is clear out of this tent so

379
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,440
there's four plants in this tent

380
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,959
um and yeah this one is gonna be

381
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,079
this is the mother plant for those other

382
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,239
ones and we're just gonna try and grow

383
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,759
as much nice bud on this as we can

384
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,919
oops gonna do a little maintenance

385
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,639
forgive me um

386
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,078
and then this one is a clone of that and

387
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,600
what i want to do is i just want to kiss

388
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,599
it with pollen and a couple of the bud

389
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,560
sites so that i can make my own

390
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,120
seeds i'm not going to use the

391
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,479
hermaphrodite um pollen from the other

392
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,240
scene i've actually got a different

393
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,680
um pile that i'm going to use and i'll

394
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,278
show you that in a second but

395
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,120
uh in the meantime yeah so there's two

396
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:28,639
gorilla glue autos going right there

397
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,320
there's these two critical plans and

398
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,799
then i got some pollen going in the next

399
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,240
ten well almost going in the next tank

400
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,719
uh so this is my 2x4

401
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,639
let me close this up real nice and tight

402
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,240
so that i can be

403
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,639
very intentional about where the pollen

404
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,159
gets give me one second

405
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,759
okay i'm so sorry about the blurble

406
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,519
again like i'm just acquiring equipment

407
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:51,360
and trying to make it work

408
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:55,519
this is a night terror og plant from um

409
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:59,039
from rare dankness out of colorado um

410
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,278
so i i popped a couple of seeds and i

411
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,240
ended up finding this male in here um it

412
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,639
is

413
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,360
cool because um you know it's got a lot

414
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,039
of

415
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,240
characteristics that i like on a female

416
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,679
like i like the way that this is

417
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,519
stacking out and i really want to use

418
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,319
the pond from that so

419
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,759
this is in the same room sadly so i mean

420
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,000
maybe that's a big mistake is to have it

421
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,360
in

422
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,278
even in the same room even in two

423
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,159
different tents um everything is sealed

424
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,759
up you can tell

425
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,439
with zip ties um on either the

426
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,720
all of the outside things so hopefully

427
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,839
there's nothing leaking out of this

428
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,920
except for when i open the tent

429
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,639
um and at that point you know hopefully

430
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,759
we're not

431
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,440
exposing things too long to uh

432
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,958
to the air so um yeah and the other tent

433
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,240
is fully sealed every time that this

434
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,518
gets open so

435
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,440
uh that's the goal um

436
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,120
yeah the blurble light i'm sorry about

437
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,680
that it really kind of sucks

438
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,879
um but you can see i got some boys in

439
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,919
here we're gonna get the pollen out of

440
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:55,838
this and i'm gonna

441
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,360
just kiss a couple of the colas on the

442
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,959
plant that i have going

443
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,039
uh with the idea that then i've just

444
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:04,159
gotten set with my own seed

445
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:07,120
for some amount of time

446
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,838
because you know it's seed's not cheap

447
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
um

448
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,040
and i'm not a cheap guy and i don't want

449
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,959
to do this a cheap way but i'm also so

450
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,958
interested in the uh and the

451
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,078
characteristics of breeding and like

452
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,679
what you might get and um you know i'm a

453
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,120
guy who likes to like just take projects

454
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,799
and run with them so

455
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,639
uh we're gonna give this a shot and see

456
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:28,319
if we can make something

457
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,639
something work yeah so that's all i got

458
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,639
um

459
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,399
peter let me know if you need me to

460
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,440
record anything else uh

461
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,559
and i'll be happy to talk ad nauseum

462
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,160
uh about what my thoughts on on growing

463
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:46,638
and all that kind of stuff

464
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,639
thanks so much and have a great day
