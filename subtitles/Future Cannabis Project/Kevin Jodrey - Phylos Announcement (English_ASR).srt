1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,209
some news dropped about Philo's

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:09,660
bioscience and for a number of years now

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:12,359
they've been collecting they've been

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,179
creating the galaxy of genetics maybe

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,759
you can talk a little bit about sort of

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,948
how they came out and what they've been

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,480
doing and what the news is this week all

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,868
right we'll see that's pretty

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,730
interesting

10
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:31,320
um so Philo's originally Mowgli gets

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,200
tied into I want to say one of the

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,289
museum's of Natural History and they

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,550
want to do mapping of cannabis you know

14
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,759
and they want to start to be able to see

15
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:44,788
this picture in a more clear fashion Rob

16
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,460
Clark from cannabis botany a very famous

17
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,469
cannabis I'm going to say he's a

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,710
scientist because he he works in

19
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:55,170
scientific levels but culturalist oh so

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,359
Rob Clark comes to me and says hey we're

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,670
about to create this galaxy to start

22
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,229
laying out the outliers of cannabis so

23
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,120
we can start to see relationships

24
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,158
between varietals and we can start to

25
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,048
get a better look at what's going on and

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,460
I was like cool and we'll be able to use

27
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,049
the data down the road to help us

28
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:11,789
understand reading and help us to

29
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,229
understand resistance and help us

30
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,200
understand the plants at a better level

31
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:17,728
so I agreed and I contributed material

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,879
to the galaxy that was directly from

33
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:22,590
Afghanistan that someone brought me so I

34
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,810
knew I had material that no one else had

35
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,780
in circulation so that it could start to

36
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:32,070
lay out I say the fringes of the galaxy

37
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,320
and what I knew was that cannabis was

38
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:35,908
protected by the illegalities and so

39
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,889
when I got to speak to people decades

40
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,659
ago the reason why there was no

41
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,478
competition for us was because the

42
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,219
federal illegality made it unfeasible

43
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,989
for any major company to get involved

44
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,658
because it was too risky just like it is

45
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:51,328
now until it's federally legal a large

46
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,979
company could lose asset forfeiture of

47
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:54,658
their investment and material and their

48
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:56,429
infrastructure so that's why none of

49
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,689
these major players are here yet that's

50
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,270
why they're buying into Canadian

51
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:01,798
companies because Canada it has a system

52
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:04,078
that's a little more stable they don't

53
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,870
have the same risks so the American

54
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,629
Giants are buying Canadian

55
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:11,360
company's a priyavrata marlborough they

56
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,519
buy into Chronos that put like 1.8

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,620
billion into a Canadian company that

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,170
gives them now an ability to operate and

59
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,330
wait you just saw another Canadian

60
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:22,609
company canopy I just think they they

61
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,250
just hit up acreage where they're gonna

62
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,720
tie in you know I think 3.5 billion

63
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,669
they're gonna buy them as soon as it

64
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,400
goes federally legal so that does tied

65
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:34,609
in the point of that is that there was

66
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,990
no other companies coming in to do this

67
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,670
type of work so that to me there was

68
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,280
this opportunity to take a look at the

69
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:43,129
plant material and I went met FiOS a

70
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,680
screw and met Mobley and Ralph the CEO

71
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,879
OU and metalness scientists and it was

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,219
pretty straightforward they're trying to

73
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,199
assemble data and down the road that

74
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:52,759
data would get used in breeding and it's

75
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,349
clear that you know what companies do

76
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:56,389
and I didn't have any fear of them and I

77
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:57,949
still don't because I know they're not

78
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:00,199
taking your material and then

79
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:02,119
replicating it through code they're not

80
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,530
taking it into a gene gun and spraying

81
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,120
it onto a cucumber so they can then

82
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:10,250
create your sally's perp it's it's

83
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,259
information that lets them see into this

84
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,939
thing and I think that what needed to

85
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,419
happen and I think that they're going to

86
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:17,150
do this

87
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:18,679
soon is to release the the disclaimer

88
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:22,129
that you'll receive that says noneya

89
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,989
material is ours it's just that I don't

90
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:25,400
think that they saw the blowback coming

91
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,870
I don't think they realize people were

92
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,370
going to panic so much and I think the

93
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:33,860
panic is really more based off of the

94
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,879
minimization of the cultivator today

95
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:40,459
we're from 95% of us we're all being

96
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:42,469
depressed so we don't feel like we're

97
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,330
valid because we're not a multi-billion

98
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:45,889
dollar company and we don't have

99
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,810
security and we're trying to figure out

100
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:49,039
how to get product into stores we're

101
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,930
trying to figure out how to even get

102
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,599
licensed most people don't even know

103
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,219
licenses right now so I think I lose my

104
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,959
license for my farm the end of this

105
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:58,219
month but I know what I'm going through

106
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,250
the annual because I'm talking to the

107
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:03,680
CDFA and we're just getting a few little

108
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:06,379
dates straightened out for contracts and

109
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,610
stuff but the bottom line is none of us

110
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,340
have any kind of being

111
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:13,100
legal security and we have very little

112
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,930
market penetration and most people that

113
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:17,000
do are getting buried financially rather

114
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,949
actually losing money and so the

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,509
terrified and so when someone says what

116
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:22,729
taking your material and we're gonna

117
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:24,409
we're gonna utilize this info I think

118
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,020
that people believe that they're gonna

119
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,180
steal the tools that you use but they

120
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:30,649
don't have that ability that ability

121
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,720
will be taken from you by bigger

122
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:34,489
companies who will do utility patents

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,770
that will just cover broad swaths and

124
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,629
material and even though utility patents

125
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:40,668
can be challenged in court you happen to

126
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:42,949
have a lawyer that you can go and have

127
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:45,409
them challenge it for you and I think

128
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:48,918
that that's very important to understand

129
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,930
because you have to get some form of

130
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:53,209
movement and so Philo's creates a

131
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,668
company that looks at the genome they

132
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:57,349
then create a service that you can

133
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:59,659
utilize as a cultivator so as a

134
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,060
cultivator I could hire them to start to

135
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,680
look at my breeding lines and from the

136
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,000
information they've gathered from

137
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,560
looking at four or five thousand

138
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,060
different varietals it gives them the

139
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,168
ability to understand what they're

140
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,600
trying to look at when they're looking

141
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:13,759
at your work so then you can create

142
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,220
lines that you can patent that you can

143
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,949
license and people are screaming about

144
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,510
this but if you're in corn or wheat or

145
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:23,689
any other commoditized crop which

146
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:25,759
cannabis is now that's how it works and

147
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:27,199
and if you don't understand that then

148
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,389
you'll eventually be in a situation

149
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,389
where nothing on your farm is yours to

150
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:35,839
use without paying someone else and I

151
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:37,909
just think that that's the world we're

152
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,769
in the world we were in was really nice

153
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,290
we all got to basically do what we chose

154
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:44,689
but we're not in that world anymore it's

155
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,250
been completely changed and it really it

156
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:48,319
was gonna happen no matter what no

157
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,120
matter what special bill was written for

158
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,310
the little people it doesn't work like

159
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,620
that in America America doesn't write

160
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,600
bills for little people it writes bills

161
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,139
from major companies that consolidate

162
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,330
and work and cultivators are very

163
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,069
victimized by that and so I think that

164
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,719
when Philo says we're gonna be doing

165
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:07,430
this everyone feels minimized if they're

166
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,440
gonna take your plant material they're

167
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,639
gonna steal it but they're gonna steal

168
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,889
it now they're gonna use the information

169
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,360
to give them information but basically

170
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,800
you have to work with them for these

171
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,689
projects so when they announce they're

172
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,340
putting together massive facility a lot

173
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:20,930
of that is to do breeding work with

174
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:23,259
breeding partners that they're in

175
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,879
relationships and partnerships with and

176
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:30,348
I don't see the problem with that it's

177
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:33,199
just a lot of the concern when they

178
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:36,139
first came out with seeking samples of

179
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,769
plant material to sequence I think it

180
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:42,589
was back in 2014 at the time cultivators

181
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:47,000
were wary and have always been wary of

182
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:50,689
biotech and that idea that they could

183
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,410
steal their heirloom varieties and and

184
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:56,538
so Philo's at the time seemed adamant

185
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,120
that they would never be entering into

186
00:06:56,538 --> 00:07:03,819
the breeding space and so I think that's

187
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:07,728
part of the concern is they have now

188
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:12,259
sequenced thousands of varietals over 80

189
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:16,009
countries and you know breeders and

190
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:19,668
growers have paid to have these these

191
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:21,769
sequenced and now the announcement is

192
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:24,259
that they intend to partner with plant

193
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:27,918
breeders and tissue culture nurseries

194
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:31,098
and they're claiming to have a more

195
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:33,228
in-depth genotyping method that they

196
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:36,918
plan to use in these ventures and that's

197
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:39,519
called a SNP can you talk about what

198
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:42,439
that is it's just it's a more accurate

199
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,750
view the thing is that you know there's

200
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,728
many ways of looking at the genome and

201
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,500
I'm not a geneticist so you mind you I'm

202
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:51,259
a cultivator who looks at this from a

203
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,079
very simple perspective so I don't claim

204
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:56,509
to be a geneticist by any means but it's

205
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,740
utilizing scientific tools to take a

206
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,180
look at the chromosome and find out

207
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,120
where on the plan

208
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:04,160
is the markers where the where are the

209
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,129
indicators and the triggers that make

210
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,510
things occur and by taking a look at the

211
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:11,540
tremendous numbers of plants that allows

212
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:14,329
it to happen when when when you send

213
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,220
your DNA into anybody its data if you

214
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:18,829
why do you think that they want the data

215
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,570
so they can look at the data but your

216
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:22,969
your heirloom varieties aren't being

217
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:24,860
stolen because they can't replicate it

218
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,750
from the code but it lets them take a

219
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,730
look and understand what to see and what

220
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,279
makes things what it is so it gives them

221
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,870
a huge database tool to utilize for

222
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,419
projects but it's not you're not

223
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,100
stealing your shed so you are I'm

224
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,110
someone who's involved in breeding

225
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,840
projects with them where I pay them and

226
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,850
I have them look at my material so that

227
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,700
I can then get information back so that

228
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:49,790
I can then understand what I'm looking

229
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,860
at and and I don't have any fear of it

230
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:53,480
and I and I knew from the beginning that

231
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,830
at some point all this material would

232
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,480
have to go into breeding because I

233
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,310
thought you know most companies do it's

234
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,710
kind of like 23andme everybody's angry

235
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:02,239
that they they took the data and used it

236
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,730
well what did you think they were going

237
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,310
to do with the data you and and for me

238
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,289
the the galaxy did two things primarily

239
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:11,269
it got stuff into into public domain

240
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:12,799
which is what I wanted all these

241
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:14,539
varieties that I had collected over the

242
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,750
years to be so that this way it at least

243
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:20,240
allows there to be a stamp in time that

244
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,059
says this variety was being used prior

245
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,159
to you saying you created it and so

246
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:26,989
finalists can't take it either because

247
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:29,600
they didn't create it they was they just

248
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,190
mapped it and I wanted to make sure that

249
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,420
cultivators who had some of these killer

250
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,520
varieties that we've been playing with

251
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:36,829
the years had at least some ability to

252
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,019
keep cultivating them and finalists was

253
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:41,270
a great marketing tool to show customers

254
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:43,129
product and let them see relationships

255
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:44,960
with things that allowed us to take a

256
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:46,879
look at varietals and see relationships

257
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,710
until you have you know a million

258
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,419
samples you're gonna have missing data

259
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,490
points and so you're gonna see into

260
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:54,829
relationships that don't make sense and

261
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,769
you're gonna see incomplete pictures

262
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:00,230
until the technology comes forward and I

263
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:02,329
think that as you go forward you'll see

264
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,389
more and more attack but the bottom line

265
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:07,649
is you either utilize technology or you

266
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:10,889
don't and if you think

267
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,419
anyone that's in business is there to do

268
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:14,639
charity well then they're there not a

269
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:17,399
philanthropy group they're in business

270
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,600
to do business and I think people have

271
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,999
to understand that from the beginning

272
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,369
that when you work with companies they

273
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:26,369
have an agenda but when I spend time

274
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:28,920
with the scientists I never felt in any

275
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:30,809
way threatened by them they wanted to do

276
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,448
what they want to do which is map and

277
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:35,789
then assist readers and projects I don't

278
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:38,188
see what that's such a traumatic event

279
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:39,509
and to be honest ninety percent of the

280
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:41,399
people that are screaming about you

281
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:43,230
taking my genetics where'd you get the

282
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,629
damn things from who did you get it from

283
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:48,480
somebody gave it to you I created it

284
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:50,550
really from thin air and so you're

285
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,589
really reusing someone's stuff anyways

286
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:55,229
and so but what material isn't available

287
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:57,389
and ready source there is almost there's

288
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:01,110
nothing really that has the true value

289
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:03,419
that a a patented line would hold for us

290
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,249
in the future and I think that you know

291
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:06,269
when I when I speak to grower groups I

292
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,709
tell them all the same thing you all

293
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:10,350
have to get together combine your

294
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:12,119
resources create a common line something

295
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,829
that works for you regionally that

296
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,839
allows you to have something that all of

297
00:11:13,828 --> 00:11:17,969
you can cultivate the differentiation

298
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,569
that can't be touched by other people

299
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:24,420
and it's not about have a magic clone

300
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:26,248
it's about I have I have a reproducible

301
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:27,688
line that has some form of unique

302
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:29,639
characteristics and I don't think people

303
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:32,458
realize how many patents are out there

304
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,620
right now by these major groups it's

305
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,328
unreal and so people look like they're

306
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,159
gonna steal my material or you already

307
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:40,138
already lost half the stuff you have

308
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,719
because you don't realize it falls under

309
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:44,669
utility patent and so everybody is

310
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,410
worried about somebody mapping something

311
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:48,269
well it's already been taken but

312
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:49,558
nobody's really looking at that and for

313
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:51,509
me I've been looking at that for a long

314
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:53,249
time where I realized they're gonna come

315
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:56,159
and take everything because that's how

316
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:57,749
it works in Ag and we're in Ag we're not

317
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,568
in a legal drug dealing anymore we're an

318
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:02,399
Ag and an ad big companies do this and

319
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:03,709
to me FiOS was a group of scientists

320
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,210
that when I spent time with

321
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,620
and I watched them in their personal

322
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,990
lives and I watch them how they behave

323
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,759
to me they're reputable and they've

324
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,339
never not been reputable I've never had

325
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,500
an issue with them and I don't I'm not

326
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,940
part of FiOS as a company so me me

327
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,639
pushing their product and me pushing

328
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,010
using the galaxy for the way I used it

329
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,659
it benefitted most every single person

330
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:26,870
who used it because it allowed them to

331
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:29,958
understand what was connected to what it

332
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:32,450
gave him some good ideas about the the

333
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,528
amount of hereditary traits and we move

334
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,350
forward through homozygosity

335
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:38,838
heterozygosity how much was was fixed -

336
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,399
how much was variable and a lot of

337
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,990
people to use the galaxy as a killer

338
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,778
marketing tool because public loves the

339
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,740
damn thing and so you you use the tools

340
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:49,909
in front of you at the time and for me

341
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,430
the people that I deal with at the

342
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:53,929
company I think are they're scientists

343
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:55,338
but I think that reputable scientists

344
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:58,278
and I never had an issue with them and I

345
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:59,660
don't have an issue with them now do did

346
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,889
I think they were going to breed down

347
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:03,409
the road yeah because that's what

348
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:05,659
genetics companies do and I think they

349
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:07,850
were gonna steal anybody's data no but

350
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,769
they did that having the data give them

351
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,830
an idea of what to look at Shore and

352
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:16,909
that's part of the trade so can you

353
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:21,320
explain more how you see them using the

354
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:24,379
data that they have and how it will

355
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,650
perhaps change the game going forward

356
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:29,299
well it's not just Dennis it's other but

357
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,799
through this medicinal genomics - that's

358
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:32,809
Kevin McCarran and that's a that's a

359
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,899
competitive company and McCarran is a

360
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:38,269
genetic genius - and they I think

361
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:40,579
they've done the Jamaican lion or some

362
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:42,110
strain they're really going into but if

363
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,400
you take a look at enough material it

364
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,440
lets you start to get a bigger picture

365
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,360
bigger picture helps you understand a

366
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,300
smaller picture so if they have an idea

367
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,720
of what things look like and unique

368
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:55,370
traits and qualities when they look at

369
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,810
your stuff that can say hey we've seen

370
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,129
this before these are the markers

371
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:59,929
because you have to remember there's no

372
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:02,629
book to follow it's kind of like micro

373
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:03,739
propagation micro propagation is very

374
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:06,409
easy

375
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,690
with a laboratory and a scientist if

376
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:11,360
there's a recipe and most plants have

377
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,040
recipes the the formulation is to do the

378
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,600
propagation with cannabis there is no

379
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,189
book to follow so that's what everybody

380
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,460
struggles is trying to create the

381
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:22,940
proprietary formulas to replicate the

382
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:25,190
plan and once that happens it's simple

383
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,790
but right now none of this is in play

384
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:31,370
and so for me this is a race and the

385
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:33,709
race is I need to find a company that

386
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,840
can take information they have and then

387
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:39,350
let me take the work that I'm doing on

388
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,850
my Hill and have it studied so that I

389
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,649
can actually try to create something

390
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,170
that's unique differentiate and enough

391
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:47,000
so that I have an ability to hold it so

392
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:49,129
it just it's a tool a bigger picture

393
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,059
tool they can use do to refine a smaller

394
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:55,939
picture all right well thank you what

395
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:57,589
helps to understand more about what's

396
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,050
happening with that big announcement

397
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:03,110
because it did seem like on the surface

398
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:05,750
a reversal from what they've been saying

399
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,279
in the past so well I think that when

400
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,990
they said they're not a breeding company

401
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,819
they're saying that we ourselves are not

402
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,970
going to create the plants and then sell

403
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,230
them and they're not they're working

404
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,750
with you they're working with people

405
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,879
like me in the process of this they can

406
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,799
get plants and then I can release these

407
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:24,169
plants to them to put through nurseries

408
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,750
and move into the world but FiOS is not

409
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:28,399
creating their own plants they're

410
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,470
helping you breed they're a reading tool

411
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,509
it's like the calculator doesn't do the

412
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,820
math you have to do the math the

413
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:38,049
calculator just makes it easy and that's

414
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:40,730
how I see science if it's tools and I

415
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:42,319
wish it was different in the sense that

416
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,210
we could all just do what we did like we

417
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,950
did prior because it would be lovely but

418
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,290
we're not there didn't want we're so far

419
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:51,259
past that that people have a hard time

420
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:53,779
understanding that the this the scope of

421
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:55,129
the competition that's coming in to take

422
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:58,519
all the cannabis production globally

423
00:15:55,129 --> 00:16:01,120
it's so big and so funded and so

424
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,509
intelligent that you are absolutely

425
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,399
about to get stuck into a meat

426
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:07,350
and if you look if you look at like

427
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,698
steep hill ready go Dino from steep hill

428
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,028
has been saying this for years

429
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:15,419
so that steep hill does genetic analysis

430
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:16,588
and and I respect Reggie in terms of he

431
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:19,889
definitely knows what he's doing he was

432
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:21,360
a Monsanto breeder and so and that's

433
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:23,070
where most scientists go to work is a

434
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,839
big companies you don't go to school and

435
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,760
spend a couple hundred thousand dollars

436
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,980
on an education to get a PhD so you can

437
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,419
go work at the corner store you go to

438
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,149
where the money is so he was basically

439
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:35,458
you're saying training that wasn't

440
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:37,379
trained he was a PhD who worked at

441
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,879
misako he didn't get trained at myself

442
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:40,409
nobody went to work for my son because

443
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,350
what does Monsanto do they treat plants

444
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:44,879
and then just working for steep hill for

445
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,690
a number of years yeah doing a similar

446
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,399
program laughter why it's do if you can

447
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,750
clearly tell you what they can take in

448
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,490
what they can't take what they can use

449
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,389
and what they can't use so he's been

450
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,730
probably one of the more vocal

451
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:59,519
proponents of you can use the services

452
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,860
we can't steal your material it's just

453
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,970
that he didn't get the consent of

454
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,058
respect ready because he's a brilliant

455
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:08,100
guy but he didn't get into the public

456
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:10,199
the way the galaxy did does the galaxy

457
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,808
caught you visually so the galaxy

458
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,579
created this incredible push and it was

459
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:16,470
a wonderful tool because it allowed the

460
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:18,448
public to get caught up in it too which

461
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,720
has been crucial because you need

462
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:24,539
marketing tools I think also that Reggie

463
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,480
I recall was talking about patents being

464
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:30,659
a reality years a future reality whereas

465
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,210
Philo's was more focused on this is how

466
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,130
we're going to protect you from having

467
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,259
your material patented so I thought I

468
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:40,320
felt like there were much different

469
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:42,509
perspectives coming out of each company

470
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,639
and when I when I when I talked to

471
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:47,819
Philo's never once that I John something

472
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,799
like that I'm not paid by him so it what

473
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:51,808
was my benefit of using it my benefit

474
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:54,490
was I needed the tools I needed the

475
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:56,160
tools to help me look into the genome

476
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,480
than I could I had this guy from NASA

477
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,620
say well it's not as accurate as it

478
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,240
could be and I said well then what

479
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:03,308
company should I use and he goes well we

480
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,630
there is none we have to do it privately

481
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:06,339
and I said well that's lovely that means

482
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,630
nobody can use the technology so

483
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:10,029
therefore it's worthless to the grower

484
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:12,220
so anything you can't use is worthless

485
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:15,609
things that you can use at least have

486
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:18,850
some they have a value because you use

487
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:21,609
it at the time and I never saw a Philo's

488
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:23,558
as a malignant group because their

489
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:25,058
desire was to do this so they could get

490
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:26,558
the information so down the road they

491
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:29,410
could be involved in breeding projects

492
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:30,730
by helping growers breed that seemed

493
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,470
pretty clear to me the whole time

494
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,620
so I'm looking I'm listening to this one

495
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:37,120
like never once did I ever think that

496
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:38,169
they weren't going to use the material I

497
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,119
just knew they couldn't use your

498
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,039
material and take your code and

499
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,349
reproduce your plant from a dead piece

500
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,178
of plant material and I know they make

501
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:47,589
special equipment in life that can do

502
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:50,100
all these incredible things but the end

503
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:51,909
of the odds of a small biotech company

504
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:54,939
doing it pretty small

505
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:56,440
you know that's Syngenta level and you

506
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,370
don't think there are 40 billion dollar

507
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:03,070
company so and when they come in when

508
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:04,299
Syngenta comes in which they will you

509
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:05,589
have a problem because they're going to

510
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:07,359
sweep through this thing like that with

511
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:09,159
a broom and we're all going to be

512
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,769
growing the same kind of products and

513
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,929
they may not be GMO they might not have

514
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:17,289
other organisms melded into but they'll

515
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:18,820
definitely be patentable and enforceable

516
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,409
and if they come to their store and they

517
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:24,240
test your product they find out it's the

518
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:26,710
same product you have a problem just

519
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,349
Syngenta and bit Monsanto and Dow

520
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,509
Corning any of these massive major BASF

521
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:36,939
all these major companies that are tied

522
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:38,410
into global AG so we're in the future

523
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,130
you're seeing a future where we're going

524
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:43,269
to have much less variety in cultivars

525
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,770
all completely I've been saying this

526
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:46,269
figures that as soon as everybody got

527
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:47,920
compressed because you can only hold six

528
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:49,509
plants at your house so how many got

529
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,460
much how much how much of a project can

530
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:54,009
you run if you're not a licensed none

531
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,210
and if you have a license what can you

532
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,579
do you have to make sure you make money

533
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:59,329
because

534
00:19:55,579 --> 00:20:01,599
licenses of savage so you know move it's

535
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:01,599
a real
