2
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:15,059
the bottom line is you must create

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,100
markets in order for you to be in the

4
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,809
market if you have something that's so

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,429
specific that only three people want to

6
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:21,778
buy it when those three people don't

7
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:24,420
want to buy it you're sitting on that

8
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:26,070
shit and you can't you don't have an

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,560
ability to sit on flour

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,730
you can't offload it you can't take it

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,618
and say well now we're gonna blow it

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,890
because you've already processed it so

13
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:37,289
you've wasted money you've spent time

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,090
you have to be very clear and the way

15
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:42,329
this works is that you start to create

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,550
these sun-grown models that allow the

17
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,350
customer to say wow that was really good

18
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,759
I would like to buy more sun-grown

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,160
instead of trying to fight for your

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,679
brand value what you fight for is a

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,229
bigger picture of brand value that you

22
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,090
can then get under and then you start to

23
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:58,229
be able to get differentiation you start

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,420
to get noticed

25
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:03,119
once you're noticed you can now

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,549
introduce the customer to what you do

27
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,438
and then you can start to be able to

28
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,110
release the information of when your

29
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,849
products gonna come out if you follow

30
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:13,920
the way people buy things they don't

31
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:15,239
like variety everyone's a kind of

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,310
variety and I'm like really how many

33
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,250
different kind of shoes you got not that

34
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,030
many women women like variety and shoes

35
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,859
but really they don't buy how many

36
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,659
different foods do you buy how many

37
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,400
different things do you really buy when

38
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,390
you go you go to the supermarket do you

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,780
leave with a different item every time

40
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,090
no you have a range of things that you

41
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,368
use and that's basically how people

42
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,978
function is they work off a repetition

43
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:42,930
and pattern and so what you have to do

44
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:44,840
is realize that that when you go into a

45
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,270
store and there's 400 varieties

46
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,060
the customer goes to many and they ask

47
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:53,759
the person who's selling it what's

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,700
selling what's hot what do you like and

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,739
in a simple sentence you've destroyed

50
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,409
the business but for almost every one of

51
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:02,968
those farms because the relationship has

52
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,670
to be built with the people who are

53
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:07,500
interfacing with the public you have to

54
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,239
be able to let them understand why your

55
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,649
product is better you don't need to give

56
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,289
them a t-shirt you don't need to get my

57
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,090
hat they don't

58
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:14,908
shit they're gonna give it away what you

59
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,719
need to give them is product

60
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:22,870
Aloha I command you because every time I

61
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:25,568
see you you give the same thing pack a

62
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,340
matches have some pre-roll and two

63
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:29,378
business cards so you don't lose the

64
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,598
damn thing and what that does is it

65
00:02:29,378 --> 00:02:34,149
develops a relationship so that people

66
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,949
start to see you as an individual not

67
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,539
just the company and they get to

68
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:39,098
experience your product and they say hey

69
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:40,688
the last couple times I smoked the fish

70
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:42,459
it was pretty good when I go to the

71
00:02:40,688 --> 00:02:45,098
store and I need a pre-roll I'll look

72
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:47,408
for that blue and light box and they

73
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,939
start to pattern and I think that these

74
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:52,358
are the things that you really need to

75
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:54,158
discuss and talk about in in the in an

76
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:56,200
honest sense because what happens is

77
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:57,929
people become very very protective of

78
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,119
their genetics because it's your

79
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,889
material that represents you and so

80
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,650
you're emotionally connected to it and

81
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:07,389
you're like I am my jeans but you're not

82
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,280
you're not your jeans

83
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:11,290
there's something that you work with and

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,348
over the course of your career you have

85
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:15,789
definitely grown more than one line and

86
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:18,009
so because of that what you've done is

87
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:21,608
you've always moved into things that are

88
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:23,769
marketable and to me the the destruction

89
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:27,760
of our culture in terms of diversity of

90
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:29,620
genetics was really around 2002 and that

91
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,689
was when the perp came out and so when

92
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,829
the perp came out the perp comes into

93
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:38,229
this perfect storm of internet and it

94
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:38,980
comes into Oaksterdam where you start

95
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:40,509
Ochs today and I don't mean the

96
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:43,479
University I'm talking about when

97
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:46,989
Oakland became Oaksterdam and the blunt

98
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:48,668
and how people bought pot and so I'm

99
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,349
watching this this I had the perfect

100
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:51,519
couple years before I got hot and all of

101
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:53,500
a sudden it blew up and I couldn't

102
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,180
understand why it blew up so I said I'm

103
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,370
going down the bay to check this out so

104
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,409
and I was always tied into the the hood

105
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,480
in the bay so I said let's go into the

106
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:03,489
hood and let's figure out why people are

107
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,918
buying the perp and when they ran up to

108
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,900
my car and threw that bag in the window

109
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,299
I realize that under street lights that

110
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,489
purple color with those orange hairs was

111
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:14,709
instantly recognizable in a way that

112
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,358
nothing else resonated and what it did

113
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:19,238
is it let people get ahold of a variety

114
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:21,339
that was high in sesqui terpenes that

115
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:24,159
didn't taste like shit Anna Blount so

116
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,739
the blunt and street lights

117
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,550
an instant recognizability created this

118
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,170
desire and in a brief second if you

119
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,329
weren't in purple business you weren't

120
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,400
in business and at that moment every

121
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:38,919
single person I knew who had collections

122
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,609
of genetics they had incredible lines

123
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,830
from the past couldn't sell any pot and

124
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,530
so they started throwing away all this

125
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:49,449
material and going into the purp because

126
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:52,239
you can't hold libraries if you're poor

127
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:54,370
you can't hold collections if you poor

128
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,230
it's kind of hard to light up a mom room

129
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,850
if you're not selling the clones it's

130
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,950
kind of hard to hold a huge collection

131
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,570
if it's a risk and it's a felony if

132
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:02,709
you're not getting paid because if

133
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:05,110
you're not getting paid you can't afford

134
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:06,699
a lawyer and so if you're really in

135
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,259
business you kind of understand I need

136
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:10,269
to make enough money to afford lawyers

137
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:11,889
or I'm gonna go to straight to prison

138
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:14,259
because the public defenders only there

139
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,990
to negotiate a deal they're not there to

140
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:18,969
beat a case so if your career at what

141
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,970
you do there was these realities that

142
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,890
shaped your decisions and the perp was

143
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,620
the first variety that took over a

144
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:29,349
market on a wide level and basically

145
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,740
wiped out everything else and I looked

146
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:35,020
at that situation because I didn't jump

147
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,699
on it as quick as I should because I

148
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:37,899
couldn't understand why people was so

149
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:39,219
caught up with it when there was all

150
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:41,199
this killer cannabis we were still

151
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,430
consuming and growing and I was like oh

152
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,469
man people just not making the right

153
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,110
decision and I realized that what I was

154
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,990
doing was I was emotionally blinding

155
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,569
myself to the market reality and so when

156
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,668
I went down and said I got you they're

157
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:56,259
doing it because of this let me know

158
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:58,839
that we needed to focus on per

159
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:00,819
production we needed to focus on purpose

160
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:02,319
we needed to get better models to get

161
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,089
the perp higher level and more purp

162
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,279
because if there was anything under an

163
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:08,769
80/20 in terms of perp the green ratio

164
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:11,559
it didn't have the money so you started

165
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:14,409
seeing per quod as hundreds on 90 tens

166
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,009
or 80 20s or 70 30s meaning perp to

167
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:20,470
green ratios and it changed the business

168
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:23,469
we're in to the degree that we've never

169
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,780
come back to the diversity prior the

170
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,880
small dispensary operations allowed

171
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:30,969
people to be able to move micro loads

172
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:34,120
you know 10 15 pounds to dispensaries in

173
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,740
a diverse form for a long time so most

174
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,759
people who aren't old like me that had

175
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,160
actually hustle in the day they

176
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,319
used to 215 protection and storefronts

177
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,780
to move pot and so they said people love

178
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,490
my stuff they do because you have a

179
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,199
storefront to sell it and it's

180
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,300
convenient but as soon as they shut

181
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,219
those storefronts down you're screwed

182
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,350
and everyone said I'm gonna use

183
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,240
Instagram you screwed when they ban you

184
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,980
I'm gonna use Facebook sorry they banned

185
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,509
you I'm gonna use Craigslist they banned

186
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,939
you so all of a sudden all your

187
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:03,709
marketing tools are gone you have no

188
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,449
tools and all you now have is

189
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:07,189
desperation where you're begging to find

190
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:09,589
a distributor who will possibly take

191
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:12,560
your product and then find some place to

192
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:15,829
move it and what takes place is that you

193
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,259
are victimized in that process and when

194
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:20,569
I when I research this I discovered that

195
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:23,089
the poorest person in the economy is the

196
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:25,009
agricultural worker the agricultural

197
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:28,609
worker is the single lowest paid person

198
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:30,560
and in any industry and I was like we're

199
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,199
gonna get buried alive because there is

200
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,120
no appreciation for agriculture that's

201
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,250
not how America works we work off an

202
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,590
industrial model so what we need to work

203
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,170
off of is this luxury model and the

204
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:44,060
luxury model was highlighted in a quote

205
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,759
I saw from the guy that owned Rolex and

206
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,829
the the the world was turbulent and a

207
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,480
reporter yelled at the owner Rolex house

208
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:51,979
the watch business and he goes I don't

209
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,509
know I'm not in the watch business I'm

210
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,050
in the luxury business and I'm ballin

211
00:07:53,509 --> 00:08:01,189
and I was like I got you he was able to

212
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,620
transcend an industry by perception and

213
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:06,129
it's perception that you're working with

214
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,980
and right now we're perceived as losers

215
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:12,290
because we somehow aren't able to be 60

216
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,840
million dollar companies and because of

217
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:17,689
that consumers don't have access to your

218
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:20,060
products and stores and so the black

219
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:22,160
market may be pumping because it's

220
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,530
cheaper but the people that are coming

221
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,480
into the new market don't buy in that

222
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:28,519
form because they don't know people that

223
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,290
are growing the people that you want to

224
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:32,809
start to sell to with this burgeoning

225
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,120
new groups they only go to storefronts

226
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,709
they only know that access and they're

227
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,799
the ones that are gonna allow you to be

228
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:41,330
able to get product that's in and move

229
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,309
because as they systematically shut down

230
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,070
the black market and they will over time

231
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:48,199
it'll always exist but I'm not buying

232
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,090
any any beer on the street corner I

233
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,300
don't know it's now there's very few

234
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,970
items that

235
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:55,649
that we buy that if they can get the tax

236
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,779
rates low enough and they can get the

237
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:59,069
supply convenient enough do you go to

238
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:02,730
all the trouble to get it in the black

239
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:05,040
you just buy it normally and so the

240
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,870
situation is that you have to be able to

241
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,449
figure out what are you doing in the

242
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,310
short term so that you can survive in

243
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,620
the long term and when I tell most

244
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:15,599
people is you need to go take a look at

245
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,279
your distributor first who you who you

246
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,379
working with and this guy no it stopped

247
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,419
us on genetics but it's the genetics

248
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:24,570
that you're using that allow this to

249
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:26,759
take place and and to me the discussion

250
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,220
of how do you get paid is more important

251
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:32,189
than anything else because you're not

252
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,080
gonna survive if you don't and if you're

253
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,060
not crystal clear about that shit and

254
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,070
grow six in your yard and enjoy being a

255
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:39,539
cannabis consumer and have the best time

256
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,100
you've ever had because they can't get

257
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:42,990
you in trouble for that and you can

258
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,490
enjoy the culture you can enjoy being a

259
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,230
cultivator you can share with your

260
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,570
friends you can do all this wonderful

261
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,190
stuff but if you're gonna be in business

262
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,530
boy you better be crystal clear who

263
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,940
you're playing with and when I go take a

264
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:58,019
look at operations that are about to

265
00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:00,540
spit out 250,000 pounds a year with

266
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,659
brilliant individuals running them with

267
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:06,779
agricultural programs that are on point

268
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:08,250
how do you compete and the only way that

269
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,259
you're gonna do this is through being

270
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,659
crafty and crafty mean and you're good

271
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,250
at what you do but you're sly and so you

272
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:17,129
have to be able to start to figure out

273
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:20,490
the things that you produce what regions

274
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:22,529
in the state like those things I did

275
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,110
this United States wide for clone

276
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:26,610
operations because the reality of it is

277
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,680
all the cannabis that was grown here

278
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,320
majority of it 90% was moving out of the

279
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:34,589
area and so what I did is I did market

280
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,750
analysis of all the major regions in the

281
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,490
US so I could understand what they

282
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,080
wanted and when you came in and spoke to

283
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,789
me I would have a private consult with

284
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,830
you and I'd ask you where you're moving

285
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:45,509
it and if you were moving it to Florida

286
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,430
I knew what I knew what you should grow

287
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:50,480
and if you were moving it into certain

288
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:53,339
into certain places certain demographics

289
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,500
certain niches I could tell you what you

290
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,259
should grow so that you had an ability

291
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,419
to actually sell the product otherwise

292
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,580
you're just growing something hoping

293
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:04,319
that it's gonna sell and when the market

294
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,600
was under produced

295
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,120
everything sold if you lived in Humboldt

296
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,240
you know about Red Dog Red Dog was this

297
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,190
green thing covered in red hair that was

298
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,149
didn't get you hi was she laughing in

299
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,279
the back way you remember the days of

300
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:19,860
Red Dog when Red Dog I ran wild in the

301
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,230
hills of so hum that shit's biomass

302
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,870
fodder you wouldn't give it to a goat it

303
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:27,329
was 48 hundred bucks a pound people

304
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,818
started to believe that they were

305
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:31,859
actually successful because there was a

306
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:33,588
shortage of product and the fact that

307
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,778
you could get it into the system

308
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:38,399
majors major shot made you fly but as

309
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:40,649
soon as it changed you were out of

310
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,299
business and so what I recommend to

311
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,940
people is you really need to take a look

312
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:47,809
at your supply chain who is your

313
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,459
distributor and who do they sell to and

314
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:52,948
the key thing that I think that we need

315
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:55,708
to work on is the ability to hold your

316
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:58,620
genomic forms after you've produced them

317
00:11:55,708 --> 00:12:01,258
in a manner that doesn't destroy the

318
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,568
quality of the product until it can move

319
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:05,669
into the supply chain because once you

320
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:07,649
let go of it everything I see in the

321
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:11,068
dispensary almost 90% of it is

322
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:13,409
diminished and I know most of the people

323
00:12:11,068 --> 00:12:16,078
I deal with I've historically done local

324
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:17,639
sourcing and so I go and meet you I

325
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,919
check out your stuff and I'm like it's

326
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,919
primo by the time it gets to me in a jar

327
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,659
it's not primo anymore and I look at the

328
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,599
dates and I realized wow that was a

329
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:30,088
seven month time frame that took for you

330
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,949
to get it from here to get it to me and

331
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:33,660
how many people are really thrilled

332
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:35,129
right now with their business models

333
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:38,939
like man I'm so happy I'm just gonna

334
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:40,620
jump up and down and cheer and a lot of

335
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,199
it is because you can't get return on

336
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,328
your money at a rate of speed that lets

337
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:47,129
you cover your costs and so what you

338
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:48,778
have to do is you have to like I said

339
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:51,120
earlier is take a look at what you're

340
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:52,919
trying to sell and realize that the

341
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,259
things that you produce is incredible as

342
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,208
they maybe don't get rid of them but

343
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:00,059
sometimes you just have to hold them so

344
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:02,278
I hold banks of plants that I know will

345
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:04,258
come back into trend for me it's old

346
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:06,480
stuff it's stuff from the 70s 80s and

347
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:09,509
90s things that make me happy from my

348
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,459
youth I know who I want to go after I

349
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:13,740
want to go after 50 to 70 year old

350
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,809
people people that have disposable

351
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,789
income because thirty year olds that are

352
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:19,979
the the biggest population of the

353
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:21,569
spencer ii people are cheap because they

354
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,129
don't have disposable income so they're

355
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,480
not gonna buy a lot of your weed they're

356
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:26,009
gonna buy a little bit see a shit

357
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,629
they're gonna be hyper picky because

358
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:30,870
that's all they have to do is be picky

359
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:32,549
and you're in the wrong market and so

360
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,730
for me I know where I'm gonna go because

361
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:38,729
I define it and it allows me to say okay

362
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,740
my future is to go after things from the

363
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:44,279
past does that mean I can sell them

364
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,049
today no but I will in the future once

365
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,389
we could start to establish our market

366
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:51,089
share what am i doing this season on my

367
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:55,379
own farm biomass because I know that I

368
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:57,930
said if I can get 500 a pound vs. 700 a

369
00:13:55,379 --> 00:14:00,509
pound and it leaves all in two days and

370
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:03,029
it comes back in two months why that's a

371
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:06,059
good business decision and yes I might

372
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:07,470
lose total profit potentially but more

373
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:08,609
than likely I'm gonna make way more than

374
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,500
I ever would have made if I try to play

375
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,180
the weed game I'm looking at so many

376
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,460
people jar and shit up and I'm like this

377
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:16,859
isn't unbelievable you're not gonna sell

378
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,050
this crap and by the time you do it's

379
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,539
gonna be diminished and it's gonna make

380
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:23,159
you look like you're inferior and so

381
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,839
when I go to I tour dispensaries

382
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:28,139
constantly and I look at product

383
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,930
non-stop and I go wow I saw the truth of

384
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:33,840
it people love indoor because the people

385
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:36,509
who do indoor production are typically

386
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,460
better financed because in order to put

387
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:40,259
together in 3000 light operation you

388
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,920
have a lot of money and when you have a

389
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:43,350
lot of money

390
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,909
you also have financial planners that

391
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,259
say hey we need to have supply chain

392
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:48,419
management so let's get a distribution

393
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:49,769
license let's get a partner that has

394
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:51,779
storefront ability

395
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:54,090
let's get packaging and manufacturing

396
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:56,159
and so all of a sudden they can get

397
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:58,590
their product to the store in two months

398
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,929
so indoor in two months is different

399
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:03,060
than outdoor in seven months and the

400
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:06,299
problem with it is is the customer is

401
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:09,000
unhappy and so I go in and and have

402
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:10,399
friends that buy product from an

403
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,539
incredible number of dispensaries

404
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,980
because they are they're older and they

405
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:15,959
have money they're affluent and they

406
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,110
love weed and so they sample pot

407
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,150
constantly and their never-ending ly

408
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:24,000
dismayed at the quality and they're

409
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:26,459
always horrified at home bolting Trinity

410
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,250
in Mendocino God the herb is fucked and

411
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,019
I said it's not let me bring you up to

412
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,458
Humboldt and let's go smoke fresh weed

413
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,399
and then

414
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:38,239
my god it's the best part of a smoked

415
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:39,619
but it's lost in translation and so what

416
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,209
I tell people that are caught in these

417
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:44,110
situations is that you need to have

418
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:46,729
flour that is rock hard because

419
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:50,209
processing manufacturing will not damage

420
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,860
it it needs to not be so mono terminan

421
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:54,229
because unless they keep that stuff at

422
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,539
below 68 you're gonna destroy it it

423
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,579
needs to be heavy sesqui dominant so

424
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:01,308
that when they smoke it and burn it they

425
00:15:58,578 --> 00:16:03,138
get the experience and you need to make

426
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:05,419
sure that it yields enough in a

427
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:07,129
convenient enough way so that you're

428
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:09,198
actually making money on what you're

429
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:11,199
doing and people like yeah but that's

430
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:14,299
commercial I said no no it's targeted

431
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,519
commercial is massive production you're

432
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:18,919
doing targeted production and you're

433
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:22,058
putting yourself in a situation by using

434
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:25,568
genetic choices to find things that work

435
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:29,990
one of the things I think that's a

436
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:32,058
important point is that you find what

437
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,459
variety worked under what methodology

438
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:36,948
because you're gonna choose things that

439
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:39,048
your friend grew and the problem is that

440
00:16:36,948 --> 00:16:41,748
your location doesn't produce the same

441
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:44,509
product so some things need to have a

442
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:46,730
cooler temperature and if it's warmer

443
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:49,669
you flare off these monos no matter what

444
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,289
you do and if it's not sunny and hot

445
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:53,868
enough you don't get density and

446
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:55,610
therefore that's an issue and so when

447
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:57,439
you're trying to match up what you put

448
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,419
on the market and you're choosing things

449
00:16:57,438 --> 00:17:01,639
that people have what you're trying to

450
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:03,139
do is make sure all the factors match so

451
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,088
that you can actually take data it's

452
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:06,740
called extrapolating if I take data from

453
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:09,500
one set and apply it to another

454
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,788
it doesn't mean it's accurate it doesn't

455
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,640
you have to make sure that everything

456
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:15,078
holds true in both sets otherwise what

457
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,390
you're doing is you're you're doing a

458
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:18,980
guess and what we want to be able to do

459
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,319
is take the information that you all

460
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,149
have which is this unbelievable quani of

461
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:26,088
information of how do you create

462
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:28,250
incredible cannabis and then what

463
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:30,408
varieties shined in those production

464
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,970
methodologies and then instead of

465
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:33,500
looking at you enable like use your

466
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,778
frigging competitor he's not he's your

467
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,450
collaborator you're all basically in

468
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:39,859
collusion if you have to be careful cuz

469
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,380
I get yelled at when I say those words

470
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:44,658
because price-fixing and collusion scare

471
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,230
the regulator's but that is the drug

472
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:47,330
business

473
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,880
and it's also community business and as

474
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:51,589
long as you don't agree to set price you

475
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,070
can most definitely communicate about

476
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:58,908
how to do production and what I did for

477
00:17:55,069 --> 00:18:01,599
this event was Josh brought me this

478
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:03,049
incredible plant that he bred so Josh a

479
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,199
humble guy

480
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:09,200
excellent cultivator and very good at

481
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,630
sifting good genetic material and he

482
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,340
says keV I sifted this out I want to

483
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,350
give you a copy here's some of the flour

484
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:18,109
here's the plant and I smelled it and I

485
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:20,509
said holy shit that's sellable and so I

486
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:22,099
did the snake JAMA test where I put it

487
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:23,808
in a jar and I hold it up to you and

488
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:25,849
when you smell it I move the jar around

489
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:28,908
and if I can get you to dance with the

490
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:31,908
jar back and forth and then you realize

491
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:33,889
I got you I got you so that lets me

492
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:35,899
clearly know that you were enthralled by

493
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:37,459
the flowers so much that you didn't give

494
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:39,408
a shit that I was making you move up and

495
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,079
down and jump all over the place then

496
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:43,970
you realize whoa I was so attracted to

497
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,648
the flower that you had hypnotized me

498
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,980
like it was a flute and it's

499
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:51,759
snake-charming and so then we go okay it

500
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:55,819
has the nose to grab someone's attention

501
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:58,879
and then you smoke it and you go yes it

502
00:18:55,819 --> 00:19:00,859
matches profile the expectation of the

503
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,659
nose is delivered in the mouth so that

504
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:03,888
you don't let someone down how many

505
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:05,600
times have you smoked something that was

506
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:08,028
incredible in the nose and it was a in

507
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,038
the mouth and you're like hey garbage

508
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:12,380
and so the problem is you're

509
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:12,769
disappointed so you can't disappoint

510
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,480
them

511
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:16,190
so the profiles have to match I'd rather

512
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,630
have it low in the nose and awesome in

513
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,200
the mouth than vice versa

514
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:23,659
and so his variety matched identically

515
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,130
and so and I'm someone who studies

516
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:26,659
market and I'm good at picking things

517
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,210
that go into markets and I said whew

518
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:33,679
that has everything we want in taste and

519
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:36,409
in smell visually it works what's the

520
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,419
high like beautiful and I said oh this

521
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:40,370
is a tool and it's not a tool that you

522
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:42,980
need to switch your whole garden to but

523
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:45,829
it's something that you produce and what

524
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,509
you do is as a cultivator you're not

525
00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:49,849
allowed to do a lot of the things you

526
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:51,710
were prior but just like today I'm

527
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:53,269
bringing six plants because I can bring

528
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,798
six plants anywhere I want I'm allowed

529
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:56,659
to have six plants in my possession any

530
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,220
time I choose so therefore I can bring

531
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:58,580
six plants into this build and I can

532
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,339
hand

533
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:03,019
to you with no illegalities you can go

534
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:04,789
to any one of these dispensaries across

535
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:07,009
the state with an ounce in your pocket

536
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:09,349
and you can go and meet the people who

537
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:11,809
are running these facilities and you can

538
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:13,339
say here here's some stuff that we mess

539
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,720
around with and what you do is you hit

540
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:16,279
him with shit that slaps him in the

541
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,680
mouth so hard it basically takes the

542
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:21,379
teeth out of the back of the jaw and

543
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,029
they go wow that's incredible because

544
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,470
it's something that most people don't

545
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:27,200
get their hands on and that's an

546
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:29,450
introduction so things like that allow

547
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,150
you to open doors and so what I did is I

548
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,860
brought these plants in and I said I'm

549
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,509
gonna auction them off mean and you're

550
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:38,029
gonna pull straws to see who gets them

551
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:39,559
but the real truth of it is is that I'm

552
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:41,329
gonna give them to you and you're gonna

553
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:43,460
figure out a bunch of you share the

554
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:45,589
goddamn thing you're gonna take the

555
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,539
plants and you're gonna say listen I'll

556
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:49,279
cultivate it I can share a clone because

557
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:51,559
you can share clones amongst each other

558
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,410
as cultivators every farm has an ability

559
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:57,529
to produce its own material I helped

560
00:20:54,410 --> 00:21:00,680
write these laws on how nurseries farms

561
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:03,019
and stores into relate because I have

562
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:07,310
all of them and I said nursery should be

563
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:09,619
able to sell product but not retail farm

564
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,909
should be able to not be a slave to a

565
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:12,679
nursery they should be able to have

566
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,880
their own nursery option but they

567
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,190
shouldn't be able to sell the the

568
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,600
nursery products they grow because then

569
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,970
it then it competes with the nursery

570
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,639
stores should be able to sell the retail

571
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,410
so that each one of these operations has

572
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,910
an ability to make money because

573
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:28,460
otherwise what happens is you're

574
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:31,009
favoring one over another and they all

575
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,710
have to get paid a good business deal as

576
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:36,440
both of us walk away satisfied if we if

577
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,120
we walk away pissed off bad business so

578
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,910
in order to make it work you have to

579
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:42,769
create a fairness and in the situation

580
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,660
that we created so that we would be able

581
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:47,089
to have some kind of success in the

582
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,740
different forms was that individuals who

583
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:50,869
had their own farms could do their own

584
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,940
nurseries for themselves they could

585
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:54,979
breed they could produce seed they could

586
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,710
produce clone form you can share six

587
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,240
plants and so I brought these plants and

588
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:02,720
I propped up some plants and I brought

589
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,220
in six and I'm gonna give them out but

590
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,500
what you want to be able to do is don't

591
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,360
be a prick and hoard it take the plant

592
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,220
and share it with the people that you

593
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:13,129
know so that what you have is

594
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,169
something that was selected out of 400

595
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:18,530
plants in a greenhouse in Washington

596
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:20,900
that absolutely caught my eye so heavily

597
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:23,389
that I said whoa that's the introduction

598
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,009
you take something like that you use

599
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,840
that as an introduction to the to the

600
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:29,000
stores you introduce it to your

601
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:31,490
distributors because when they smell it

602
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,230
it's instant sell ability and what it

603
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,480
does it allows you to start to enter a

604
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,669
market and then now you start to get a

605
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,860
conversation but when you're having to

606
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:42,830
give things that are delicate nuanced

607
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:45,500
and fragile and and design for people

608
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:47,808
who are more caught up in the ethereal

609
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,259
qualities of cannabis that's a limited

610
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:53,119
number so in all our minds everyone

611
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:54,769
knows pot like this and then people get

612
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,699
pissed off at blood tenders they don't

613
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:56,900
know what they're doing I had to give

614
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,788
them an education I'm like to get paid

615
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,030
15 bucks an hour to expect you could

616
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:03,589
paid 4,000 a year to grow weed of course

617
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:05,119
you're intelligent at it because you get

618
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:06,829
paid for it and you get to spend all

619
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,529
your time doing it but someone who's

620
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:11,720
making almost minimum wage how smart do

621
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:12,678
you think they are about your product

622
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,600
and you're gonna give him this long

623
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:15,530
drawn-out bullshit story about how

624
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,730
special you are

625
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:18,740
no like look I'm here to get fuckin

626
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,808
paycheck I just want to do my job

627
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,970
but they don't want to do a bad job it's

628
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:25,788
just that how much education can they

629
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,259
possibly have little unless you paid ten

630
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:30,140
Jers thirty bucks an hour which is like

631
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:32,000
a living wage and they don't so what you

632
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,559
have to do is make it easy you have to

633
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,509
make things loud you have to make things

634
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:37,399
rich you have to make them to where

635
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:39,019
they're sellable and then what it does

636
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,419
is it allows a tender to recommend a

637
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:43,339
product that then makes them look good

638
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,538
so the person who comes back doesn't

639
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,589
tell them you're recommending some

640
00:23:44,538 --> 00:23:46,069
bullshit I don't want to deal with you

641
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:49,250
anymore

642
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:50,178
because everyone who buys weed my whole

643
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,808
career I've seen it

644
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:55,429
they aren't not connoisseur in anything

645
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:57,500
but when they come in they break out a

646
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:59,600
loop I'm like holy Christ here it comes

647
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,298
because in cannabis you could be ultra

648
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,589
picky and have this ultra high level but

649
00:24:02,298 --> 00:24:05,779
everything else in your life you cause

650
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:08,119
dirty your fucking sneakers are falling

651
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:10,428
apart your house is a shithole you got

652
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,989
friends that are there nuts but with

653
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:15,590
your herb you're the most discriminating

654
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:18,109
connoisseur in the planet and and since

655
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:20,808
that's a reality you have to work with

656
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:23,488
that reality and what you do is you make

657
00:24:20,808 --> 00:24:25,079
it easy and so

658
00:24:23,489 --> 00:24:26,489
I know some people to me like damn I was

659
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,569
gonna win me one of those plants but

660
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:28,679
really what I want to do is I want to

661
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:30,118
give them on you all figure out who gets

662
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:31,830

664
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:34,558

look give me a cart of that thing when

666
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,158
you prop it because you can share a cup

667
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:41,009
with your friends and what you're doing

668
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,629
is you do in regenerative culture you

669
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:45,749
want to live you you better work

670
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:48,118
together you're gonna die and it is so

671
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:49,889
clear I get to I get to do consultation

672
00:24:48,118 --> 00:24:52,499
for some of the largest companies in the

673
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:54,238
world and they fly and and I don't go to

674
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:56,069
visit them I make them come visit me

675
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:58,048
here because it brings them down to your

676
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:59,700
level so they have to fly into Humboldt

677
00:24:58,048 --> 00:25:01,499
they gotta rent a car drive to my

678
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,749
greenhouse and I look like I'm homeless

679
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:05,399
half the time I shaved today I no

680
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:08,489
serious I shaved today otherwise I look

681
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:09,928
like the janitor and in half the time

682
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:11,788
when people meet me the first time they

683
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:13,320
think I am the janitor and they ask me

684
00:25:11,788 --> 00:25:14,819
hey where's the guy that I'm supposed to

685
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:15,928
talk to and I was busting balls and say

686
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:18,058
all the smart guys are in that other

687
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:21,509
room and they all go there and then they

688
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:22,979
have to come back and they go and and

689
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:24,358
for me it's great because I like to play

690
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,759
games like that because I'm really

691
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:28,019
checking you out as a person and and

692
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,169
what we're doing is we're mentally

693
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:34,229
wrestling and once we even the playing

694
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:36,210
field now you're gonna have to play and

695
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:38,429
that's the point of this this lecture is

696
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,929
that man I've done these lectures for

697
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:42,359
ever on this stuff but this one's

698
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:44,369
specific because it's about everyone in

699
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:46,378
the room that eyes experience that

700
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:48,808
cannabis it's really good grass I would

701
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:50,608
say across the board 95% of the stuff

702
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:51,838
that I see the people in a space produce

703
00:25:50,608 --> 00:25:54,989
and I smoke and I see

704
00:25:51,838 --> 00:25:57,838
it's gorgeous pot the question is who

705
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:59,848
you selling it to and how do you get it

706
00:25:57,838 --> 00:26:02,190
to him and how do you make sure you have

707
00:25:59,848 --> 00:26:03,569
something that the market wants and how

708
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,460
do you make sure you're not just looking

709
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:07,378
on Instagram saying oh my god I need a

710
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,629
skittle gelato hybrid or I'm screwed

711
00:26:07,378 --> 00:26:11,158
well the problem is everyone else has

712
00:26:09,628 --> 00:26:12,928
the same idea if I don't have purple

713
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,099
punch I'm well you got purple punch you

714
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:15,839
got punched in the eye you got a black

715
00:26:14,098 --> 00:26:18,118
eye because people only buy it once

716
00:26:15,838 --> 00:26:20,969
now you can hybridize it and take those

717
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:23,009
those visual qualities forward but if

718
00:26:20,969 --> 00:26:26,849
you're consuming it you're like yes all

719
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:29,759
I no nose no mouth no Pawa Instagram pop

720
00:26:26,848 --> 00:26:32,428
and so the people that are in cannabis

721
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,858
unfortunately because we were so and I

722
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:36,880
was too I was someone who had multiple

723
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:39,309
identities I used to change

724
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,560
and outfits to go check all the

725
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:43,599
operations I ran I was somebody who was

726
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,970
constantly under surveillance I used to

727
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,349
have the cops going through my trash and

728
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,779
I should take all the dog shit in the

729
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:50,859
yard and put it in the garbage so that

730
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:52,569
when they went through the fucking bags

731
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:56,619
that's what they got was a bag of shit

732
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:59,710
and and so you know I had to pay the

733
00:26:56,619 --> 00:27:03,039
price for this but the bottom line is

734
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:13,539
that I was somebody who was living in a

735
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:15,700
I was living a very secretive quiet life

736
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:17,769
and I'm not I'm someone who loves to

737
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,950
talk about what we're doing but I'm not

738
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:22,299
someone who's loud in public I'm kind of

739
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,600
quiet which people find hard to believe

740
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:27,639
but actually I am and and I was very

741
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:28,899
secretive with what I did criminally

742
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,690
because I came from a criminal

743
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:34,480
background from family members that were

744
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,400
an organized crime and so I learned last

745
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,360
shot your mouth and never rat on your

746
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:42,040
crew and you be intelligent every step

747
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,899
of the way because the punishments real

748
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:46,359
and when you go and visit your family in

749
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,000
prison year after year you go all the

750
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:51,879
punishments real and so I was very very

751
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,809
quiet and when I got into the position

752
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,550
to be in what we call legal cannabis

753
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:59,379
what I did was I realized that in order

754
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:00,849
for me to make the education work I had

755
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:04,030
to shut off all my black market

756
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:07,839
operations so I took this massive pay

757
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:08,920
cut to become normal and and everyone

758
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,659
who knew me was like that's what I

759
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,180
watched my mind they were like you lost

760
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:16,180
you frigging mind man you you basically

761
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:18,490
going to be poor and I said kinda what

762
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:21,310
I'm gonna do is be free so that no

763
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:22,660
matter what I do anywhere I go I'm not

764
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:24,639
afraid of you come into my house and

765
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,769
checking on my shit man fact every event

766
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,780
I put on I invited the sheriff's and all

767
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:30,400
the regulator's so much so that

768
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:31,569
eventually they just said fuck we don't

769
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,880
need to be around you anymore because

770
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:38,109
it's almost a waste of time but what it

771
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:41,230
did was it let me participate at a level

772
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:43,089
of involvement that was absolute so

773
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:46,839
where I wasn't half steppin I wasn't

774
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:49,299
toed if in I was fully submerged in the

775
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:50,129
real because I was so afraid that I was

776
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:53,940
gonna reach

777
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:56,550
older age and be working at Walmart I'd

778
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,470
spent my whole life in cannabis and it

779
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:08,009
was such an incredible life and it was

780
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:10,019
such an original app there was I didn't

781
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:11,069
copy anybody you know the vertical nerve

782
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:13,829
I was the first person through a

783
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:15,629
vertical nursery in the country and so

784
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:17,789
these models that I was coming up with

785
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,600
were based off the fact that I was

786
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:24,000
looking for a way through a problem and

787
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:26,429
because I didn't have any any fear of

788
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,319
you catching me and I knew that there

789
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,610
was no statute of limitations issue with

790
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,919
what I had done because I hadn't done

791
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:35,369
any capital crimes I could be

792
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:38,009
unbelievably open and because of it it

793
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:39,959
let me connect into the media and it let

794
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,879
me connect into universities and it let

795
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,610
me connect into academia and it let me

796
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,870
connect into massive businesses and it

797
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:47,849
allowed me to be able to get an

798
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:50,279
education to a degree that almost no one

799
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:53,399
I know has because I've spoken to every

800
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:55,559
monster in the game and what they wanted

801
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,240
was my knowledge of the thing and I made

802
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:59,519
them trade me knowledge I wouldn't let

803
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,470
you hire me as a consultant you got to

804
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,750
play a game with me because I already

805
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,940
had most of my stuff I owned my property

806
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:08,519
I own my home and I made enough money

807
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,930
doing legal cannabis on a salary that I

808
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:11,700
could afford to take care of my children

809
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:14,279
and pay my basic bills I just didn't

810
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,840
have disposable money anymore but the

811
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,450
fact that I had already achieved the

812
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,329
success and I was building businesses

813
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:23,670
that were generating millions of dollars

814
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:28,710
let me have an audience which then let

815
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:30,539
me have an ability to use that power to

816
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,160
blow a hole in the wall so that

817
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,529
everybody behind me that I knew could

818
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,029
run through it so when I'm able to take

819
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:38,639
a look at a market and say that's the

820
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:40,710
hot spot I go and tell my friends that's

821
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,240
the hot spot and that's something that I

822
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,890
found that I'm historically good at is

823
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,980
it's a game called where's the money

824
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:48,810
it's over there I can see the money it

825
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,940
moved it's over there now and I make

826
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:52,950
sure I pay attention to this and I make

827
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,420
sure I use the tools that I have to

828
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:57,330
share the information with the people

829
00:30:54,420 --> 00:31:00,060
I'm around because unlike a lot of

830
00:30:57,329 --> 00:31:02,309
people I saw drugs on a global level

831
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:03,109
when I got into when I get in trouble as

832
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:05,569
a kid

833
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:07,009
I went in the military when I when I got

834
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:09,288
out of training school I go back to high

835
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:11,269
school and graduate and I looked at all

836
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:12,470
my friends and I realized we were all

837
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:14,269
gonna go to prison for the rest of our

838
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,589
lives and a bunch of we're gonna die and

839
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:17,149
they did they're in the joint for the

840
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:19,609
rest of their life for crime or they got

841
00:31:17,148 --> 00:31:21,589
killed in crime and I was like this

842
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:23,119
isn't what I want and I didn't have any

843
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:24,918
any alternative so I went in the

844
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:27,648
military and when I went the military I

845
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:32,210
became a salvage diver and because I was

846
00:31:27,648 --> 00:31:34,250
young and I was bold I would dive on any

847
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:36,980
project and so the military used to loan

848
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:39,259
me out to the DOJ and the DEA and in the

849
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,759
mid-80s I used to get dropped out of

850
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:42,470
helicopters in the middle of the ocean

851
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:45,740
on a billions of dollars worth of drugs

852
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:47,960
so I got to see what hundreds of tons of

853
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,569
cannabis and cocaine look like coming

854
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,409
into the country and I realized holy

855
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:56,839
shit we're smoking a lot of weed and I

856
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:59,240
realized that nobody that you were in

857
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:02,000
around was a competitor because nobody

858
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:05,120
that you knew was producing 120 tons of

859
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,159
weed and it was in the it was in these

860
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:10,069
conversations with the drug traffickers

861
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:12,049
that I realized and they helped me

862
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:14,778
understand it that really I was actually

863
00:32:12,048 --> 00:32:17,869
way more like them than I was the

864
00:32:14,778 --> 00:32:20,419
military and that the future of the

865
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:21,798
world was gonna be cannabis and so I

866
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:23,720
just said well I might as well start to

867
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:25,548
restart it on a like a scientific level

868
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,889
and when I got out of the military in 89

869
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:29,148
I sparked up indoor we're using the

870
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:33,079
government vehicle to pick up all my

871
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:35,058
lights and so that background of seeing

872
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:36,470
cannabis in the billion dollar levels

873
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:38,690
and seeing you know half a billion

874
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:40,069
dollars of cocaine and you realize oh

875
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,919
there's a lot of drugs being consumed

876
00:32:40,069 --> 00:32:44,960
and so it changed my perspective on the

877
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,080
people I'm around because you are not my

878
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,440
competitor you are not the the hole is

879
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:53,418
so huge that the perception that we're

880
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,850
in competition is what screwed us

881
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:57,769
because you had petty competition with

882
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:59,808
each other and you didn't share the info

883
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:01,519
you don't share the genomic forms you

884
00:32:59,808 --> 00:33:03,470
don't share the contacts you don't share

885
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,509
the connects and I'm someone who

886
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,298
historically always have because of that

887
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:10,009
experience and it changed me because

888
00:33:08,298 --> 00:33:12,440
when you realize that nobody that you're

889
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:15,109
around is the competitor they're your

890
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,910
collaborator what it does is it starts

891
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:19,250
to allow you to share information

892
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:22,250
and I was been able to use that ability

893
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:24,230
to gather knowledge so that I could

894
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,019
survive and I'm always really clear

895
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,970
about it my mission is to not be 65

896
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:30,259
years old work in a Walmart and I don't

897
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:32,450
fault you if you work there but I know

898
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:34,099
damn well you wish you weren't you

899
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,110
really wish you weren't having to work

900
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:37,849
at 65 years old make a minimum wage

901
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:40,399
having to figure out how to how to chop

902
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:42,169
up two and a can into six meals because

903
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,640
otherwise you gonna be broke and I've

904
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,440
seen enough people that were poor I was

905
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,840
around enough poverty enough struggle to

906
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,029
realize that when you're young you can

907
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:51,919
handle the beaten but when you're old on

908
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:54,470
you might not be able to and if God help

909
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,930
you you get sick and so my whole

910
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,360
direction was I believe that cannabis

911
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,490
will one day be normalized and I believe

912
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:05,269
one day we will have a craft industry

913
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:06,920
but how do we get from there to here and

914
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:09,289
so that's why I give up so much

915
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:12,139
information all the video stuff I shoot

916
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:14,119
is to share this information is really

917
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:15,378
because I was covered so heavily by all

918
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,668
the major media I've been in every

919
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:19,128
newspaper in the country at the same

920
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:20,779
time simultaneously multiple times so if

921
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:23,389
there's 1500 newspapers in America I was

922
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:25,610
in every one of them same day over and

923
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:26,870
over it was unreal

924
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,300
and it was something that I didn't

925
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:31,759
intend to have happen it just did but I

926
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,639
realized that if I use that as a tool

927
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,100
then I would be able to use it as a tool

928
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,899
to help out my crew and when I get in to

929
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:40,849
medical cannabis really heavily I

930
00:34:38,898 --> 00:34:43,819
realized that my crew was everybody I

931
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:45,289
was involved with in any capacity and so

932
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,909
that's what the lecture today is really

933
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:49,340
about is what we did is we brought in

934
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:51,139
all these killer breeders because the

935
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:54,110
breeders of the individuals that give

936
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:56,720
you paint that you use to paint your

937
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:59,390
picture and the picture that people want

938
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,639
to buy changes over time and you can

939
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:03,529
only be so intelligent with your palette

940
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:05,509
and so what you need to do is you need

941
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:07,700
to have access to other people's palates

942
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,160
and the palates that they use you can

943
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:11,809
then use to freshen up your paint so

944
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,940
you're still in the sell in art business

945
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:16,179
otherwise you're in the hang in the art

946
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,860
business and people aren't buying it and

947
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:21,739
to me the breeder is completely

948
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:23,480
diminished because no one understands

949
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:25,159
really the work it takes to do what they

950
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,780
do and so I get connected to breeding

951
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:28,799
all the time but I'm not a breeder I'm

952
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:31,440
someone who's a seed reproducer where I

953
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,960
whole genomic forms in seed form because

954
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,750
I've been raided and armed robbed and

955
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,280
workers kill shit and you kill shit to

956
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,380
where I've lost so much material that I

957
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,970
like redundancy so if I can take

958
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,099
something I like and put it into seed

959
00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:46,109
form I can I can seal it put it away and

960
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:49,500
hopefully I can keep that genomic form

961
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:52,019
through time so my breeding desires are

962
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,119
really to hold material and then to do

963
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:55,829
sifting but I don't breathe breed for

964
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,929
stabilize lines I don't breed for the

965
00:35:55,829 --> 00:36:00,179
market so I don't consider myself a

966
00:35:57,929 --> 00:36:01,980
breeder at all and I highlight the

967
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:04,139
people that I do consider breeders

968
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,900
because what it does it allows me to

969
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:09,869
utilize their artistic ability to stay

970
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,490
current and if I can be somehow involved

971
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:14,339
with them in a positive way where I can

972
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:16,169
promote them I can carry their work I

973
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:19,110
can introduce them to the public

974
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:21,630
I can then utilize them in collaboration

975
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:24,390
then what happens as we both survive I

976
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,280
stay current the breeder stays current

977
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:28,109
and so it was the basis of the whole

978
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,670
breeder series we did a couple years

979
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:31,829
back where I paid for all of that that

980
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,389
was that's free so my company paid for

981
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:35,969
all of that because I wanted the public

982
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:38,849
to understand that as much prop as you

983
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:41,730
give me I'm only someone who works with

984
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:43,679
material that I get from them and I

985
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,840
wanted people to understand who the them

986
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,960
was and I wanted people to understand

987
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:51,150
what made them and what drove them and

988
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,860
where do they see the directions coming

989
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,829
so that people could make an emotional

990
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,210
connection to them and then say you're

991
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:59,519
the person I want to work with because

992
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:01,289
my desire is pain relief in cannabis I

993
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,449
want to go that route and you're someone

994
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:05,789
who bred for that specifically in all

995
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:07,739
your lines your selection process was

996
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:10,019
for people who are in extreme pain

997
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:12,419
you're someone who breeds for visual

998
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:14,550
stunning you understand trendy market

999
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,159
you're someone who breeds for resistance

1000
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:19,010
you're someone who breeds for biomass

1001
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:20,759
you're someone who breeds for extraction

1002
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,740
every one of these people have a

1003
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,390
specific direction you can't be all of

1004
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:25,649
them I don't care how bright you are I

1005
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:28,230
meet some of the smartest people in the

1006
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:30,450
world and I'm telling you some of them

1007
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,730
can't tie the friggin shoe they have to

1008
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:35,429
wear velcro but they can they can split

1009
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:38,369
an atom and they can't tie their shoes

1010
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:41,219
because you're not everybody in all

1011
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:42,509
things and cannabis is so massive and so

1012
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:44,699
diverse and so

1013
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:47,400
complicated and so complex that the only

1014
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:49,259
way you're gonna survive is if you paint

1015
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,420
the picture so that everyone has some

1016
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,130
kind of equal credit and in that

1017
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,809
direction what you do is you end up

1018
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,840
having the ability to access these

1019
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:59,610
people so this situation today is to

1020
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,039
bring in all these killer breeders that

1021
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:04,230
are just fantastic at what they do and

1022
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:04,769
what it does it lets you get to see them

1023
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,230
in real life

1024
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:09,360
and start to introduce yourself to them

1025
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,219
so that you can access what they do as

1026
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,289
time goes forward so that if the trends

1027
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:16,199
change and the products that you grow

1028
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:18,300
are no longer moving on the market you

1029
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:20,909
know where to go and get materials so

1030
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,100
that you can repaint your work and my

1031
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:25,769
recommend is don't I ever get rid of

1032
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:28,639
your core material hold it because all

1033
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:31,139
things come back in time plaid is trendy

1034
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:34,679
polka-dots are trendy and so at one

1035
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:36,179
point red-hot then not now back and the

1036
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,529
thing is that if all you and cannabis

1037
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:39,269
and I'd say you know there's a few a

1038
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:41,640
year my age but most of you probably 20

1039
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:43,440
years younger than me you're gonna see

1040
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:44,969
that these trends keep rotating through

1041
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,200
and I don't think any of you want to get

1042
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:48,359
out of cannabis so you wouldn't be a nor

1043
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:50,369
generative conference because what

1044
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,809
you're doing is timelessness you're

1045
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:55,199
trying to build something that

1046
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:57,599
transcends time my desire is to be able

1047
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,429
to also participate in that I want to

1048
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,409
take the property that I use to make

1049
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:03,239
money and I wanted to turn it into a

1050
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:05,219
farm so that my children could hold it

1051
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:06,959
over time I wanted to turn it into

1052
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:08,969
something that had an ability to be an

1053
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,970
asset and not a liability so it was

1054
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:13,859
never sold I wanted to be able to treat

1055
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:15,809
it as a preserve so that all then the

1056
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:18,269
animals that were there still remained I

1057
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:19,799
wanted to bring in biodiversity I got

1058
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:22,530
exposed to all these brilliant people

1059
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,260
through what I do and I realized man I

1060
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:27,090
want to do that too but I also realized

1061
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,700
if I fuck this up I'm gonna have to sell

1062
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:31,800
it and I don't have time to make that

1063
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:33,869
mistake and so what I did is I looked at

1064
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,970
every single aspect that needed to be

1065
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:37,889
covered done and understood and I got my

1066
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:41,099
hand and every single cookie jar I could

1067
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:43,199
get it into and it aged me you know III

1068
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:45,659
if I grow a beard I look like I'm 70

1069
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:48,199
because it's so white but what it did

1070
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:50,609
was it gave me an unbelievable amount of

1071
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:52,829
understanding of where we're at what are

1072
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:55,230
we doing and the fact that for most

1073
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:56,170
people you're emotionally taking a

1074
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,969
beating

1075
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:00,400
than anything and that what you have to

1076
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:02,709
be able to do is realize that your valid

1077
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,260
the genetics that you hold are valid

1078
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:06,519
your choice is a valid it's just that

1079
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:09,309
you have to be timely

1080
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:13,929
where are you valid in the time line and

1081
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:16,720
so for us it's to say what are we doing

1082
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:18,789
with our products who am i selling it to

1083
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:21,338
who's the people that process it

1084
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:23,920
manufacture it and distribute it what

1085
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:25,779
stores do they sell to what's the

1086
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,358
expectation of the people at those

1087
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,970
stores so that you can make a market

1088
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:33,670
penetration so that you get some form of

1089
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:36,189
brand differentiation where people start

1090
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:39,760
to realize that you are on a shelf that

1091
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:41,230
you're still there next year and what

1092
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,490
happens is you start to build a

1093
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:47,230
recognition and for me the longevity

1094
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:49,149
component is the biggest one most people

1095
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:52,059
really don't understand that you need to

1096
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:54,760
be constantly present all the time or

1097
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:56,500
people forget who you are and so you

1098
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,210
make a big splash and then you're out of

1099
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,969
the market for nine months and then you

1100
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,710
come back and you're gone but if you can

1101
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:05,019
create a splash big enough to get an

1102
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,000
emotional buy-in and you can get people

1103
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:08,798
who want to give you emails and you have

1104
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,389
an ability to be able to highlight what

1105
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:13,480
you do through digital marketing which

1106
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:15,818
is cheap and you send them flyers and

1107
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,829
you send them pictures and you send them

1108
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:19,808
information and you let them know that

1109
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:21,160
your products are coming out and you let

1110
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:24,130
them know that that it's limited batch

1111
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:27,429
and you know there's only 200 pounds

1112
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:29,980
total available period and you let them

1113
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:32,889
know in advance people will come and buy

1114
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,630
that product and hold it and you will be

1115
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:36,969
able to have an ability to get people

1116
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:39,160
who want to mess with you and in the

1117
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:40,689
process of messing with you it's the

1118
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:43,029
same thing I did with genetics where I

1119
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:44,829
moved as many plants for other people as

1120
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,960
I ever did for myself I moved so many

1121
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:48,519
black market ops plants was no word for

1122
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,079
it and I got no money off of it and

1123
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:51,400
people say why do you help out so many

1124
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,750
people move in genetics and I said

1125
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,160
because ultimately everybody's coming to

1126
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,239
me for the information and if I can put

1127
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:56,889
you into the right direction

1128
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:59,229
you're still gonna come to me and when

1129
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:01,269
my day comes to sell you a product I'll

1130
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:03,338
sell you my product but I don't have

1131
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,780
that product today so instead of telling

1132
00:42:03,338 --> 00:42:06,940
you know I don't know where to go I

1133
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,740
would refer you and what that is is

1134
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,730
that's networking and what you're doing

1135
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:12,069
is you becoming some

1136
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:14,920
very powerful because you answer the

1137
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:16,780
problem of how do I get it and you're

1138
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,369
somebody that says you get it from him

1139
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,530
and instead of me getting in the middle

1140
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:22,840
of the deal to decrease the actual

1141
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:24,550
profit that that person makes you become

1142
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,559
a good middleman and step out of the

1143
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:28,750
deal you become more of a connector and

1144
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,090
then what happens now is you start to

1145
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:32,590
get respect from the customer because

1146
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,980
they realize that what you're trying to

1147
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:38,950
do is satisfy a desire and that desire

1148
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:40,449
is success for all people and when that

1149
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:42,519
becomes synonymous with who you are

1150
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:44,230
people will forgive you for your ups and

1151
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:45,489
downs and what happens everyone thinks

1152
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,320
you're gonna be perfect in business if

1153
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:49,719
I'm like bro if you can hit a 92 man you

1154
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,940
you're unreal that means out of a

1155
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:54,039
thousand people you serve nine hundred

1156
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,059
and twenty of them correctly cuz 80 of

1157
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:56,559
them are gonna be pissed

1158
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:58,420
forty am I gonna hate you because they

1159
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:00,789
just hate in general and forty of them

1160
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:03,099
because you made a mistake but the nine

1161
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:04,869
hundred and twenty who you didn't have

1162
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:07,059
issues with are the ones who sustain

1163
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:09,100
your business and most people have never

1164
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:10,779
been in public business and they sure as

1165
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:13,059
hell haven't had to deal with public

1166
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,650
business with the internet and what

1167
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:16,840
takes place is you have to be able to

1168
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:19,090
make a connection and a penetration so

1169
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,680
that people just realize I do business

1170
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:23,170
with this person because they give me

1171
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:24,730
something that I need and when I wanted

1172
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:29,079
to find things that were comparable

1173
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:31,630
similar rare you become a network your

1174
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:33,639
digital marketing is more important than

1175
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:35,650
any of your other brand bullshit because

1176
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:37,900
and I don't mean on Instagram because

1177
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:40,660
people who are 50 to 70 don't look at it

1178
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:43,240
people that have money don't look at it

1179
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:44,980
they don't look at it to buy weed they

1180
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:47,349
come into the store and they trust the

1181
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:49,750
person at the counter your ability to go

1182
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:52,569
and figure out my distributor sells to

1183
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:55,000
these seven stores you go drive to those

1184
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:57,130
seven stores yourself and you introduce

1185
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,820
yourself to these people and say I'm the

1186
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:02,800
farmer from this stuff here is something

1187
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:04,690
that I cultivate you can give them a

1188
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,609
joint you can you could hold up an ounce

1189
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:08,829
in your pocket you make these

1190
00:44:06,608 --> 00:44:11,170
connections so that people start to see

1191
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:13,179
you as a real person they go wow that's

1192
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:15,070
really nice product I'll remember that

1193
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:17,289
and then when someone comes in and they

1194
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:19,210
refer it they're able to refer your

1195
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:19,809
products and then you and I have an

1196
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:22,059
identity

1197
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:22,619
anybody who's successful right now in

1198
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:25,049
the market

1199
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:27,599
it's connected into a vertical chain and

1200
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:29,730
I study this and I'm like it's scary it

1201
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,710
is scary if you're the farmer you're the

1202
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:34,320
most vulnerable and you're relying on

1203
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,429
distributors to sell your pot and the

1204
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,960
problem is that they're not qualified

1205
00:44:35,429 --> 00:44:39,480
because most of them are selling shoes

1206
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,220
two years ago and so now they're selling

1207
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,469
your stuff so what you have to be able

1208
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:45,989
to do is be able to take the things that

1209
00:44:43,469 --> 00:44:48,359
you have that are highly attractive you

1210
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:50,669
meet these individuals you showcase it

1211
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,530
and then you take a look and you're

1212
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,599
asking them what do your customers want

1213
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:56,250
here and they're gonna tell you the

1214
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:58,440
customers here typically needed to be

1215
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,329
under this amount of money so you need

1216
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,820
to go backwards and figure out what can

1217
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:06,000
I grow that will let me make margin on

1218
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:08,430
something that fits that and then you're

1219
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,199
able to use your craft skills your

1220
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:12,899
organic methodologies which are very

1221
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:14,909
efficient to deliver products that fit

1222
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,470
those ranges and that gets you

1223
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:18,420
penetration and once you have

1224
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:20,579
penetration you have recognition and

1225
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,490
with recognition comes acceptance and

1226
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:25,920
Trust and now you can take them anywhere

1227
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:27,299
you want in your portfolio but when you

1228
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,720
try to say this is what you should be

1229
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,550
doing they step back and so this is this

1230
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,409
question is the this this thing today I

1231
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:36,750
thought about it I was like this has to

1232
00:45:34,409 --> 00:45:38,250
be a marketing lecture and it has it

1233
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,449
really does because most people are

1234
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,010
getting the shit kicked out of them

1235
00:45:39,449 --> 00:45:43,349
financially and I'm like wait a minute

1236
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:44,880
you all have incredible genomic forms

1237
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:46,589
you'll have collections you got buddies

1238
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,869
that have stuff are you selling selling

1239
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:50,640
good well cuz I'm not seeing a lot of

1240
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:52,920
happy smiles when I ask that question in

1241
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,379
general and it's really because of these

1242
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,530
issues it's about trying to understand

1243
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:01,680
what's the material I have to grow to

1244
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:04,920
satisfy the sale and once I can do that

1245
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:07,649
now I have an ability to start releasing

1246
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:10,650
my material and start to build your

1247
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:12,150
unique brand and and I hate to use the

1248
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:14,369
word brand because there really is no

1249
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:16,559
brands in cannabis nobody's big enough

1250
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:18,389
to satisfy brand when you think a brand

1251
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,900
you're thinking Nike you're thinking

1252
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:23,639
Pepsi you're thinking Heineken you know

1253
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,300
name anything that you know that's a

1254
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:29,759
brand you're none of those and what we

1255
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:32,370
need to do is create the brand of high

1256
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,010
quality Sun grown biologically based

1257
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:38,250
cultivation and under that

1258
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:39,780
and we all fall underneath it and then

1259
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,090
what that does it allows you now to

1260
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,560
really cheapen up your marketing because

1261
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,690
all you have to do is be able to

1262
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,849
understand how do we work together to

1263
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:50,760
create an umbrella we all get underneath

1264
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:53,279
it we fill this pile with the stuff we

1265
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:56,010
have when it's correct and we identify

1266
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,870
the destination market once you identify

1267
00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:00,240
the destination that's what you produce

1268
00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:02,609
and even though you might love your

1269
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,229
Bridal to death well you're allowed to

1270
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,250
grow six plants legally so I tell people

1271
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:07,679
all the time you want to get an

1272
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:09,510
emotional ride girl six and those are

1273
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,369
the ones you get to keep I grow six and

1274
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:13,680
I turn four of them into IRS so that I

1275
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:15,359
donate because unfortunately I know too

1276
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:16,710
many people from the Med years that are

1277
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,660
dying to cancer and they can't get

1278
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:21,030
anything and so I only need two two

1279
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:22,769
plants to satisfy years worth to smoke I

1280
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,840
mean shit if it's a big enough plant I

1281
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:26,969
can't smoke the whole thing in a year so

1282
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,039
I choose things that I like and I choose

1283
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:31,019
things that I want to donate which lets

1284
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:32,880
me still participate in the culture that

1285
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:35,489
we came from which was collaborative

1286
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,190
community and it lets me still be able

1287
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:41,250
to feel like I'm a human being and then

1288
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:42,869
I put that emotional shit to bed and I

1289
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:46,260
go after the business like I'm at dump

1290
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:47,460
doing business and I'm crystal clear

1291
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,440
about it and a lot of times it's

1292
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,539
offensive to people because when we have

1293
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,019
discussions I mean I'm brutal and I rip

1294
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:57,090
your plant apart because I make you

1295
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:58,530
substantiate your claim and it kills

1296
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:00,809
people because I watch them have

1297
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:02,610
emotional breakdowns in the conversation

1298
00:48:00,809 --> 00:48:05,250
because their connection to what they

1299
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:06,329
produce is some form of their identity

1300
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,070
and we talked about that a little

1301
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:10,949
earlier it is not your identity

1302
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:12,870
your your identity the product is

1303
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:15,210
something that you produce that reflects

1304
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:18,029
your desires that reflects our ethos

1305
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:20,250
that reflects your skills but it changes

1306
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:21,840
over the course of your career and so if

1307
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:23,880
you remember to hold the material that

1308
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,769
you've been holding for time do as much

1309
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,630
seed preservation as possible

1310
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:29,699
so this way you can keep these genetics

1311
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:32,010
because there's a lack of them globally

1312
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:33,239
you're not gonna mine this stuff I get

1313
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:35,010
hit up from countries all over the world

1314
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:37,739
that are asking me to provide them with

1315
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:39,510
jeans and I'm like where's all your

1316
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:42,389
jeans and I realize that they're going

1317
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:46,050
because cocaine took out all the jeans

1318
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:48,129
in South America and heroin opium

1319
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:50,890
production took out all the jeans in age

1320
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:53,680
and so lo and behold you have radically

1321
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:56,409
shrunk gene populations to mine from you

1322
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:58,809
go into any part Africa civil war strife

1323
00:48:56,409 --> 00:49:01,659
famine plague took out the cannabis and

1324
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:05,049
so all of a sudden cannabis is just like

1325
00:49:01,659 --> 00:49:07,779
coral and so coral a friend of Mines a

1326
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:09,730
world-class coral collector and he said

1327
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:12,940
Kathy goes we hold more varietals in

1328
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:14,860
house now than is available in the ocean

1329
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:17,019
because the oceans are acidifying and

1330
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:19,660
all the corals dying and so people like

1331
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:22,570
him hold coral and then they sell it as

1332
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:24,429
frags and they ship it globally so that

1333
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:27,250
other coral collectors can access the

1334
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:29,710
material and I realized that only within

1335
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:31,510
the community of coral ists do you have

1336
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:33,130
access to coral because you can no

1337
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:35,320
longer mine it from the ocean because

1338
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:37,300
it's no longer there so the material

1339
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,070
you're all holding is actually priceless

1340
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:42,550
because you really can't go find it

1341
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:44,920
anymore but what you need to do is is is

1342
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:46,720
is don't believe that it's been been

1343
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:49,420
minimized because that's the lesson for

1344
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:51,730
perp perp said hey your weed isn't worth

1345
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:54,309
anything anymore you need him sell purp

1346
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:57,699
and instead of people saying I got you

1347
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:59,170
let's let's make seed pops they threw

1348
00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:01,480
everything away so they could go full

1349
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,829
purp and the problem was it screwed them

1350
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,809
down the road because they got rid of

1351
00:50:02,829 --> 00:50:07,000
half of their easel they no longer have

1352
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:08,739
the paint needed to make new varieties

1353
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,409
they don't have an ability to stay

1354
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:13,689
current and when you start to use stuff

1355
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:15,969
that's trendy you bottleneck your

1356
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:18,429
genomic form and you make it susceptible

1357
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:20,230
to things you're not aware of and so by

1358
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:22,809
having a tissue culture facility and

1359
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:25,179
having lab access we find that some of

1360
00:50:22,809 --> 00:50:26,400
these very popular varieties if I pull

1361
00:50:25,179 --> 00:50:29,049
them from the general population

1362
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,910
sometimes up to 60% of the samples are

1363
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:32,800
carrying Fusarium they're carrying a

1364
00:50:30,909 --> 00:50:35,500
fungal problem some of them have viral

1365
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,990
issues so everyone using these

1366
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:41,349
bottleneck genetic forms are susceptible

1367
00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:42,669
to major problems and so it takes places

1368
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:44,380
you have to be able to say I got you I

1369
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:46,119
can't go chase trends that are

1370
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,970
bottleneck genes because if we have a

1371
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:51,190
pathogenic issue I'm screwed and so you

1372
00:50:48,969 --> 00:50:52,899
have to have enough diversity and you

1373
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:54,760
have to be able to take this diversity

1374
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,619
and understand how do you diversify it

1375
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,150
into the markets and that's why we

1376
00:50:56,619 --> 00:50:59,199
talked about the fuels the Earth's the

1377
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:00,880
florals and the fruits because

1378
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,539
fundamentally that's how cannabis breaks

1379
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,360
up

1380
00:51:01,539 --> 00:51:05,980
scientifically it breaks up into these

1381
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,530
divisions based off of these Terp

1382
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:10,599
relationships and once you can start to

1383
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:13,150
see this it starts to help you

1384
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:14,589
understand how to market your product it

1385
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:17,110
helps you understand who your target

1386
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:18,610
audience is it starts to let you know

1387
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:21,700
that when you look at the database you

1388
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:23,890
can figure out what's working I love to

1389
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:26,139
use the the the digital galaxy from

1390
00:51:23,889 --> 00:51:28,449
Philo's because it lets me take a look

1391
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:30,609
at relationships between plants and lets

1392
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:32,439
me understand am i working with

1393
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:34,059
something that's unique or am i working

1394
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,829
with something that's not unique and

1395
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:38,110
what's the level of homozygosity

1396
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:39,849
heterozygosity so if i breed it am i

1397
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:41,380
going to get an incredible spread of

1398
00:51:39,849 --> 00:51:43,690
genes or am I gonna get a narrow spread

1399
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:46,059
of genes so it's information that you

1400
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:48,970
can use to help steer your directions

1401
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:50,710
and as we go forward there'll be

1402
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:52,629
individuals that do incredible work that

1403
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:54,369
produce varietals that the market wants

1404
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,750
and you're gonna and we learn yesterday

1405
00:51:54,369 --> 00:51:58,150
all the different licensing agreements

1406
00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:00,400
you'll be able to license material from

1407
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:03,010
other people to produce product on your

1408
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,289
farm using your methodologies so that

1409
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:07,300
what you have is sell ability and then

1410
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:09,309
at some point in time when you get

1411
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:11,650
enough brand recognition you can release

1412
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:15,130
new things you're allowed then to say

1413
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:17,680
look I can do other stuff adidas always

1414
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:19,329
had three stripes but lo and behold once

1415
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:20,799
they got market penetration they could

1416
00:52:19,329 --> 00:52:23,289
change some of those things and they had

1417
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,420
other things that they could sell and so

1418
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:28,179
I always look at what people buy and

1419
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:31,119
what they do and I try to overlay that

1420
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:34,059
over the reality of what we do and

1421
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:37,509
because my desire is to always be able

1422
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:40,449
to preserve protect and move the genomic

1423
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:42,460
form forward through time I know that

1424
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:44,739
the hold is priceless and to share is

1425
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,720
priceless and to be able to understand

1426
00:52:44,739 --> 00:52:50,109
how do you take this material that you

1427
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:52,839
have identify where it's going identify

1428
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:54,460
where the supply chain problems are how

1429
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,410
do you get around those issues by

1430
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:59,079
choosing genetically what you need and

1431
00:52:56,409 --> 00:53:00,730
so it's just really a series of checks

1432
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:03,519
on a box that you just start checking

1433
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:07,090
through and say the pot that I sell has

1434
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:10,000
a lag time in processing don't make it

1435
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:12,070
in any way high monoterpene if it's

1436
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,630
extremely aromatic be very careful

1437
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:14,820
because by the time the user gets it

1438
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:17,460
it's done

1439
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:20,490
when they burn it satisfactions gone if

1440
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,449
it has rough handling we're the people

1441
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:25,619
that do this

1442
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:29,519
mechanized work if it is in any way open

1443
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:32,519
it will shred in process and by the time

1444
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:34,199
the person gets it it's in pieces so

1445
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:36,329
what you sold them was a bag of crumble

1446
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:38,039
and it wasn't crumble when you let it

1447
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:40,769
leave your building but it's crumble

1448
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:43,409
when I get it out of store and so you

1449
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:45,960
you these decisions have to be made and

1450
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:49,639
you have to it just basically disconnect

1451
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:52,650
your emotional shit you have to be a

1452
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:56,039
robot when it comes to making business

1453
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:58,050
decisions and then you able the opposite

1454
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:00,090
of a robot in order to hold the culture

1455
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:02,130
and so it's very difficult because

1456
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:03,630
there's almost no industry like cannabis

1457
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:06,000
where all of us had to pay such a heavy

1458
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:07,559
toll the whole time to participate so

1459
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,420
your connection to what you do your

1460
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:11,579
connection to your plants it's your

1461
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,559
identity but the truth of it all is it's

1462
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:17,670
not these are things that are part of

1463
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:19,259
you but not all of you and so I'm not

1464
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:21,000
gonna go on forever on this because the

1465
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,260
the the the point is I want to get all

1466
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,119
these breeders that come up here and

1467
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,970
start to work and talk but I wanted to

1468
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:27,929
cover some very specific things of

1469
00:54:25,969 --> 00:54:29,699
understand that cannabis breaks up in

1470
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:32,099
two major categories that's

1471
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:33,809
scientifically accurate that's important

1472
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:35,489
because the public loves people with

1473
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:37,559
titles behind their names telling you

1474
00:54:35,489 --> 00:54:39,149
them things so they don't listen to you

1475
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:41,849
but if you put the word PhD in front of

1476
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:43,980
your name they will and what you need to

1477
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:46,019
do is have science quantify the things

1478
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:48,269
that you do so that when you put it on

1479
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:50,969
the table and it gets challenged there's

1480
00:54:48,269 --> 00:54:53,009
a proof and now it's not an opinion and

1481
00:54:50,969 --> 00:54:54,299
now what it does it allows you to be

1482
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,830
able to not have to have such an

1483
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,210
intimate argument with individuals

1484
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:59,340
because if you argue with them you lose

1485
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,900
the sale you want to be able to make

1486
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,440
sure that you're measuring your supply

1487
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,840
lines

1488
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,389
who's moving your products where do they

1489
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,980
sell it how do they process it most

1490
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:08,670
people don't have a vertical chain it's

1491
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,559
too expensive

1492
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:12,180
it's very expensive to have all these

1493
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,730
things in hand and if you're a

1494
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:17,369
distributor and a farmer on a micro

1495
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,599
license whose grill who's growing the

1496
00:55:17,369 --> 00:55:20,940
weed and doing the work when you're

1497
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:23,130
selling it and so a lot of it is you

1498
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,539
start having the ability to do it but

1499
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:26,420
unfortunately you don't have the time or

1500
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:27,980
the resources to do it correctly and

1501
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:30,380
then what

1502
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,179
doors are going to take you on when

1503
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:34,070
you're not able to provide to them

1504
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:38,118
product on a consistent level all the

1505
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:39,470
time you're basically a flash so what

1506
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:43,100
you're having to do is you're having to

1507
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:45,459
find specific operations that specialize

1508
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:48,699
in niche pot what's a good example

1509
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:51,679
people's people's dispensary right a

1510
00:55:48,699 --> 00:55:53,689
beautiful beautiful facility but they

1511
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:56,299
look for really high quality products

1512
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:58,039
because the the buyer is discerning and

1513
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:00,320
he understands that the customer wants a

1514
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:03,559
better product and so he sources out

1515
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:05,600
product from smaller entities over

1516
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:07,369
larger entities because he understands

1517
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,460
this how many people are at that

1518
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:12,019
education level not that many and so you

1519
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,039
have to go find dispensaries where the

1520
00:56:12,019 --> 00:56:15,650
people who are running them are

1521
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:18,139
intelligent and they understand the

1522
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:20,240
reality of customer satisfaction and

1523
00:56:18,139 --> 00:56:21,889
they understand that the only way to get

1524
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:25,459
really high quality product is from

1525
00:56:21,889 --> 00:56:28,190
craft manufacturers because the details

1526
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:30,740
are all checked and if they can figure

1527
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:33,590
out that they want to deal with you and

1528
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:35,179
they want your product they can find the

1529
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:38,329
distributor who will make that happen

1530
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:40,699
and so the farmer and the store need to

1531
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:43,309
make the relationship everything else in

1532
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:45,049
the middle can be worked out but if the

1533
00:56:43,309 --> 00:56:47,000
store doesn't want you people think that

1534
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:49,280
you're pushing products what you want is

1535
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,679
it to be pulled you want your product

1536
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,080
pulled out of your hands so that all you

1537
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:56,659
do is produce it and then people desire

1538
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,819
it and that has to be through

1539
00:56:56,659 --> 00:57:00,409
relationships and it has to be through

1540
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:03,590
given individuals varieties that are

1541
00:57:00,409 --> 00:57:05,989
easy to sell and it has to be able to

1542
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:08,269
understand what the margin has to be and

1543
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:11,299
if you can't produce that cultivar that

1544
00:57:08,269 --> 00:57:14,090
you have and get paid for it put it back

1545
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:16,789
in the library and then sell the things

1546
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:18,380
that have an ability to be sold and when

1547
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:20,029
you eventually get the market

1548
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:21,950
penetration you want which should happen

1549
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:23,390
over the next couple years and that's

1550
00:57:21,949 --> 00:57:25,579
not really that long a time it's a

1551
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:27,650
lifetime when you pour and it's just

1552
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:31,369
like oxygen three minutes with no air is

1553
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:33,410
a long time and so in in in life it's

1554
00:57:31,369 --> 00:57:35,539
whatever you have least supply of this

1555
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:36,920
most important and when people challenge

1556
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:38,840
me on that I tell them hold your breath

1557
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,130
and they start choking and I'm like BAM

1558
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,599
you at least supply of air

1559
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:44,880
while you was struggling to breathe you

1560
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:46,650
thought of nothing else so whatever's in

1561
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,759
the least supply is most important and

1562
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,650
for us the thing that's going to be at

1563
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:51,630
least supply is liquidity and finances

1564
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:54,119
and what we need to be able to do is

1565
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:57,568
just survive these transitions until you

1566
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:59,579
firmly establish this new industry they

1567
00:57:57,568 --> 00:58:01,500
will go after the store situation they

1568
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:03,960
will open up these opportunities because

1569
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:06,268
they're they're 700 million short in

1570
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,220
California unexpected tax revenue in

1571
00:58:06,268 --> 00:58:10,639
order to get the tax revenue they can't

1572
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:12,679
tax more they have to open up more sales

1573
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:16,108
so the only way that's going to happen

1574
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:19,048
is through the the relaxing of the laws

1575
00:58:16,108 --> 00:58:20,608
and the development of an industry that

1576
00:58:19,048 --> 00:58:21,838
means that in a couple years all of us

1577
00:58:20,608 --> 00:58:24,389
have an opportunity to really

1578
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:27,150
participate in the craft industry but

1579
00:58:24,389 --> 00:58:28,440
right now it's about survival and so

1580
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:29,430
like I tell people if someone said you

1581
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,619
know what are you gonna do I was the

1582
00:58:29,429 --> 00:58:33,659
same thing I'm going crude this year I'm

1583
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:36,210
gonna blow the farm crude so that I can

1584
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:39,210
blow it and walk away with the paycheck

1585
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:42,269
so that I can afford to pay to keep the

1586
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:44,250
farm alive and what I do with my farm is

1587
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:45,838
I can hold all my genomic forms at your

1588
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:48,088
farm because you have an ability to hold

1589
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:50,250
your material in-house you're not you're

1590
00:58:48,088 --> 00:58:51,659
not set up for six if you have a license

1591
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:53,579
you can have as much as you want within

1592
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:56,909
that specific square footage of what you

1593
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:59,789
do and you hold the material and you

1594
00:58:56,909 --> 00:59:02,399
start to create the story around the

1595
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:04,140
material and you do it digitally because

1596
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,690
that's the cheapest way to market and

1597
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:08,909
you start to be able to meet these

1598
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:10,500
people at these dispensaries and while

1599
00:59:08,909 --> 00:59:12,838
they're there you pop it up on the phone

1600
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:15,719
and you show them some cool stuff and

1601
00:59:12,838 --> 00:59:17,849
you start to link to other farms and you

1602
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:19,709
start to link to other varietals and

1603
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:21,660
pretty soon what you're doing is you're

1604
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:23,670
creating an information network of

1605
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:26,068
what's available or otherwise I get it

1606
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:28,289
from a distributor and it's a SKU and we

1607
00:59:26,068 --> 00:59:30,869
go through it and say alright this stuff

1608
00:59:28,289 --> 00:59:33,000
is that's the right one that's at the

1609
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:34,588
right price for my market because my

1610
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,739
customers can only spend so much money

1611
00:59:34,588 --> 00:59:38,608
so I can't give you a $90 bag but if I'm

1612
00:59:37,739 --> 00:59:41,038
in Hollywood

1613
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:42,509
I can and so if you can make a

1614
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:44,220
penetration into one of those places

1615
00:59:42,509 --> 00:59:48,449
then you can move some of these

1616
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:51,389
extremely less efficient cultivars that

1617
00:59:48,449 --> 00:59:54,750
don't give you the same amount of yield

1618
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:55,400
but what they do is they give you

1619
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:57,750
different

1620
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:00,030
but if you try to put that into a market

1621
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:02,820
where people want to pay 45 bucks you

1622
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:05,970
screwed and you have to clearly see it

1623
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:08,610
and so the the world were in now is

1624
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:10,169
really to me a survival world and it's

1625
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:12,480
about making sure that you keep your

1626
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:14,250
neighbors alive it's making sure that

1627
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,110
when you get varietals like Josh bread

1628
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:17,309
that's nasty you realize that you and

1629
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:19,079
your neighbor could both produce it

1630
01:00:17,309 --> 01:00:21,000
maybe your whole Hill could produce it

1631
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:23,789
because what it'll do is it allow there

1632
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,159
be enough of it to satisfy the customer

1633
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:28,190
for a whole year and then the customer

1634
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:30,269
comes back to go work with your group

1635
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:32,730
because that's how it works with all

1636
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:34,079
products that's how normal things are

1637
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:36,269
marketed that's how normal things are

1638
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,190
consumed and that's what has to take

1639
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:39,960
place and that's why I said I brought

1640
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:41,820
those plants in because I said oh my god

1641
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,550
this stuff is Killa and I wanted to

1642
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:46,350
horde it and so as soon as I want to

1643
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:49,050
horde something I know that's what I

1644
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:51,210
need to release because that has the

1645
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:53,630
value and if you just instantly want to

1646
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:53,630
release it

1647
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:04,090
so so so that's really the lesson on it

1648
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:05,799
it's it's it's just trying to be very

1649
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:08,470
honest with what you're doing

1650
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:11,830
determine the destination do your

1651
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:13,569
numbers if you're not really good at the

1652
01:01:11,829 --> 01:01:15,730
business end of that have someone do an

1653
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:17,920
assessment of your efficiency so you can

1654
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:20,110
figure out does it make sense for me to

1655
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,180
grow this and does it make sense for me

1656
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:25,059
to work with it I and I tell people a

1657
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:27,129
lot of it too is that if your desire is

1658
01:01:25,059 --> 01:01:28,719
to everyone's like I'm gonna take the

1659
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:30,280
top 20 percent of my plants and I'm

1660
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:32,169
gonna turn it into flour and the rest of

1661
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,060
it's gonna be concentrate well if that

1662
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:35,950
stuff isn't over 22 percent it's tough

1663
01:01:34,059 --> 01:01:38,019
to get it into an extractor because they

1664
01:01:35,949 --> 01:01:40,239
have to make money too so if they can't

1665
01:01:38,019 --> 01:01:42,070
get a return they don't touch it if the

1666
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:44,079
Terps aren't high we're not stripping it

1667
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:45,880
so I have a Terp stripping facility

1668
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,920
where all it does is strip turps and

1669
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,660
then dry the material convert it to blow

1670
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,829
it into biomass so it's pre converted

1671
01:01:49,659 --> 01:01:53,230
before we have to turn it into

1672
01:01:50,829 --> 01:01:54,819
distillate because these high-end

1673
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:57,159
cartridges are only from cannabis

1674
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:58,840
derived terpenes what that means is that

1675
01:01:57,159 --> 01:02:01,179
if you have varieties that have an

1676
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:03,760
incredible turn profile and a quantity

1677
01:02:01,179 --> 01:02:06,369
of it that makes sense you can grow that

1678
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:08,290
just for that and you have an ability to

1679
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:10,839
diversify what you're growing to fit

1680
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:12,610
certain markets so there's things that I

1681
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,890
started mining that release an

1682
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:18,070
incredible terpene signature with a high

1683
01:02:14,889 --> 01:02:20,619
biomass load early so that you can get

1684
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:22,690
your crop out by mid-august harvest the

1685
01:02:20,619 --> 01:02:27,519
numbers that you need which is the the

1686
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:30,280
oil the scent and combine it but it has

1687
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:32,050
to work if it's low numbers extractors

1688
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:34,660
won't touch it so you're gonna give them

1689
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:36,400
20% to the customers flower and the

1690
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:38,409
other 80% is gonna sit still because

1691
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,090
nobody wants to work with it and then

1692
01:02:38,409 --> 01:02:41,949
you get caught up in what people like

1693
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:45,430
and you're like no solvent less is best

1694
01:02:41,949 --> 01:02:47,679
in in Vancouver Canada it is but try

1695
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:49,449
selling that shit in California don't

1696
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:52,239
want it they wanted it's such a small

1697
01:02:49,449 --> 01:02:55,329
rate of speed that the best hash makers

1698
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:57,879
I know don't sell it quickly at all

1699
01:02:55,329 --> 01:03:00,159
people want convenience California

1700
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:03,430
market is convenience its simplicity it

1701
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:05,589
spends its the masses want this so you

1702
01:03:03,429 --> 01:03:07,809
have to say I got you the variety that

1703
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:08,380
I'm gonna grow not only does it do what

1704
01:03:07,809 --> 01:03:10,328
I want

1705
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:11,979
and its quality in the smoke but the

1706
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:14,289
numbers are over twenty two and three

1707
01:03:11,978 --> 01:03:16,719
five on the Terps otherwise I can't blow

1708
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:19,450
it and sell it now I have to sell the

1709
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:20,919
whole plant is flower and so now what

1710
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:23,108
you're doing is you're having to degrade

1711
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,909
the quality of your flower to be in the

1712
01:03:23,108 --> 01:03:26,558
mid market but the problem is that still

1713
01:03:24,909 --> 01:03:28,358
your labels still your brand it's all

1714
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,130
tied in you'd have to create two

1715
01:03:28,358 --> 01:03:32,469
companies one to sell your high-end

1716
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:34,630
flower and then another name to sell

1717
01:03:32,469 --> 01:03:37,988
your lower-end flower because it's

1718
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:40,778
visually lower in quality and that's

1719
01:03:37,989 --> 01:03:42,880
complicated and so I tell people I said

1720
01:03:40,778 --> 01:03:45,518
listen I said I'm telling you you have

1721
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,829
to go after this reality and understand

1722
01:03:45,518 --> 01:03:49,748
it well the beaten you're gonna take is

1723
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:52,539
going to be so aggressive you're gonna

1724
01:03:49,748 --> 01:03:55,088
have to capitulate and the question here

1725
01:03:52,539 --> 01:03:57,190
is on our regions and our values is that

1726
01:03:55,088 --> 01:03:58,808
someone told me there's no twenty-five

1727
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:02,528
years ago I hung out with an economist

1728
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:04,539
who was a from a long history of farming

1729
01:04:02,528 --> 01:04:06,309
so his family were very successful

1730
01:04:04,539 --> 01:04:07,930
farmers in the Central Valley but he

1731
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:11,170
became an economist because he said I

1732
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:13,088
hate farming but what he was was a

1733
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:15,460
brilliant economist and he and I had

1734
01:04:13,088 --> 01:04:18,038
this as a man this would have been 95 so

1735
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:20,228
in 95 I'm having discussions on the fall

1736
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:23,109
of Humboldt County to Salinas and

1737
01:04:20,228 --> 01:04:26,199
Monterey and Santa Barbara because he

1738
01:04:23,108 --> 01:04:28,838
said the cut flower industry disappeared

1739
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:30,548
due to NAFTA and so a free trade

1740
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:34,719
agreement made it cheaper to ship

1741
01:04:30,548 --> 01:04:36,639
flowers from Colombia to East Coast than

1742
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:39,039
from California to the East Coast and

1743
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:41,978
overnight an entire cut flower industry

1744
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:44,079
disappeared he said that's what's gonna

1745
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:46,629
happen to you you guys are gonna get

1746
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:48,309
wiped out and you're gonna get destroyed

1747
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:50,410
and I said to him I said well as an

1748
01:04:48,309 --> 01:04:52,599
economist I said wouldn't my route

1749
01:04:50,409 --> 01:04:54,940
through that to be unique product

1750
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:57,548
differentiation and then micro craft and

1751
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:59,200
he said yeah that's the only way out he

1752
01:04:57,548 --> 01:05:01,150
said your regions have global

1753
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:03,879
recognition but you have to be able to

1754
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:05,680
do is survive the transition and the

1755
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:08,469
region itself will have the brand value

1756
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:10,358
and so everyone's arguing that I should

1757
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:11,858
have went and picked up operations in

1758
01:05:10,358 --> 01:05:13,058
central California but I said I hate

1759
01:05:11,858 --> 01:05:14,619
central California look Northern

1760
01:05:13,059 --> 01:05:16,329
California so why would I want to be

1761
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:19,239
down there I want to be where I want to

1762
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:20,950
be and I believe that the value here

1763
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:21,630
will hold and then I'm talking to

1764
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:23,818
someone who does

1765
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:25,318
the buys for a major Canadian LP and

1766
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:27,659
they just picked up a million square

1767
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:30,989
foot of humble canopy so that it allows

1768
01:05:27,659 --> 01:05:35,068
them to have a craft division in their

1769
01:05:30,989 --> 01:05:36,528
portfolio that's not bad because when

1770
01:05:35,068 --> 01:05:39,900
you have people that are developing

1771
01:05:36,528 --> 01:05:42,750
craft businesses in your region what do

1772
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:44,818
they do they advertise the reason why

1773
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:46,768
it's craft is because it's coming out of

1774
01:05:44,818 --> 01:05:48,838
your region and so you get to do

1775
01:05:46,768 --> 01:05:51,689
something called piggyback and you get

1776
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:53,400
to go ride that forward and that's why I

1777
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:56,009
think that if we can just survive this

1778
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:58,289
next couple of years and we make clear

1779
01:05:56,009 --> 01:05:59,759
decisions on what we're doing and if you

1780
01:05:58,289 --> 01:06:02,039
want people to really love what you're

1781
01:05:59,759 --> 01:06:05,009
growing then you need to use your skills

1782
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:08,039
as a farmer and produce a product that

1783
01:06:05,009 --> 01:06:09,690
they want and then over time you can

1784
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:12,778
give them the product that you'd like to

1785
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:14,608
give them which then lets you feel happy

1786
01:06:12,778 --> 01:06:16,230
about what you're doing because you may

1787
01:06:14,608 --> 01:06:18,538
not like smoking gorilla glue a blue

1788
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:20,730
dream but the bottom line is the

1789
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:22,410
extractor sure do they love those

1790
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:25,170
products because they're hot numbers

1791
01:06:22,409 --> 01:06:27,838
high-yield easy to grow and it allows

1792
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:30,869
you to catch holes in a market that are

1793
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:32,608
here right now and that's really turning

1794
01:06:30,869 --> 01:06:35,099
your ego down and just saying look I'm

1795
01:06:32,608 --> 01:06:36,900
here to do business if I want to

1796
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:39,660
experience my culture in the way I knew

1797
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:41,099
it I grow six plants we smoke and share

1798
01:06:39,659 --> 01:06:43,368
and enjoy and I have shit that nobody

1799
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:46,588
wants to buy but I'm enjoying it and

1800
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:49,500
then the business of farming is farming

1801
01:06:46,588 --> 01:06:51,328
and if you really need to understand the

1802
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:53,009
reality just go look at agricultural pay

1803
01:06:51,329 --> 01:06:55,500
scales and you're gonna find out that

1804
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,818
farmers get screwed globally and when

1805
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,619
you put that I never tell anybody I'm a

1806
01:06:56,818 --> 01:07:01,518
farmer I said because I would imply that

1807
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:03,599
I'm broke and what that does is it

1808
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:04,979
absolutely change even when I'm

1809
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,259
struggling I don't tell you I'm

1810
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:09,599
struggling because people love to see

1811
01:07:07,259 --> 01:07:11,519
people hurt because it allows them to

1812
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,318
feel like they're in power so when I

1813
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:15,508
play business games I always tell people

1814
01:07:13,318 --> 01:07:17,969
I don't know what I'm doing and I watch

1815
01:07:15,509 --> 01:07:20,250
your response and when I see your eyes

1816
01:07:17,969 --> 01:07:24,118
blinking I know that you're trying to

1817
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:26,940
fuck me and so now I know I play the

1818
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:29,490
game with you because I want to be able

1819
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:31,230
to feel out the reality I want to be

1820
01:07:29,489 --> 01:07:32,268
able to understand the deal that I'm

1821
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:34,668
doing

1822
01:07:32,268 --> 01:07:36,468
and it's that understanding of what's

1823
01:07:34,668 --> 01:07:38,658
taking place and so the perception that

1824
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:39,789
we have to have is that where we're

1825
01:07:38,659 --> 01:07:42,559
being looked at like we're failures

1826
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:44,778
there's somehow we screwed up so bad

1827
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:47,449
that we're desperate and that we don't

1828
01:07:44,778 --> 01:07:49,429
produce good pot and that the big

1829
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:52,068
companies do it correctly because that's

1830
01:07:49,429 --> 01:07:54,139
the imagery that's being painted and so

1831
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,909
I always talk about yeah it's a struggle

1832
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:57,739
but the bottom line is all businesses

1833
01:07:55,909 --> 01:08:00,108
struggle and what it does it allows

1834
01:07:57,739 --> 01:08:02,719
people to see a normality and then we

1835
01:08:00,108 --> 01:08:06,259
could also say but we were able to be

1836
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:08,958
successful four decades prior so we have

1837
01:08:06,259 --> 01:08:10,818
a history of longevity and now we're

1838
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:12,648
having to work with the transition so

1839
01:08:10,818 --> 01:08:14,688
that we can move forward and then the

1840
01:08:12,648 --> 01:08:16,248
customer doesn't see you as a victim as

1841
01:08:14,688 --> 01:08:19,908
soon as you start begging for anything

1842
01:08:16,248 --> 01:08:22,158
you screwed you screwed never beg when I

1843
01:08:19,908 --> 01:08:24,229
got in trouble in 2002 I had to write a

1844
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:25,518
letter of contrition because I caught a

1845
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:26,959
felony right and I had to write a letter

1846
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:29,059
of contrition and so I wrote this letter

1847
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,679
and my lawyer and my friend said are you

1848
01:08:29,059 --> 01:08:32,960
out of your mind and I said no no this

1849
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:34,699
is one I'm giving to him and it said the

1850
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,980
only thing I did wrong was I move too

1851
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:41,748
fast for the rest of you Kevin Joe dream

1852
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:44,118
and I got the max penalty because I knew

1853
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:45,710
I was going to get it anyways so I knew

1854
01:08:44,118 --> 01:08:46,939
they were gonna screw me anyways and I

1855
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:49,130
said you might as well take it on your

1856
01:08:46,939 --> 01:08:52,308
feet than on your knees because at least

1857
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:55,400
at least you're holding yourself to a

1858
01:08:52,309 --> 01:08:58,099
standard and that's the truth here is

1859
01:08:55,399 --> 01:09:01,759
that every time you capitulate bend beg

1860
01:08:58,099 --> 01:09:03,679
pray the public sees you as a victim and

1861
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:05,988
then they want to beat you down in price

1862
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:07,578
when you go to the store and you play

1863
01:09:05,988 --> 01:09:09,498
this game they want to beat you down in

1864
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:11,538
price because that's a business and what

1865
01:09:09,498 --> 01:09:13,698
you have to be able to do is give them

1866
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:16,608
things that they want so that the

1867
01:09:13,698 --> 01:09:19,669
negotiations affair get you on a shelf

1868
01:09:16,609 --> 01:09:21,920
get you into the public eye get you an

1869
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:23,599
opportunity to make connections you take

1870
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,099
those connections and you network them

1871
01:09:23,599 --> 01:09:26,328
like you have your whole lives because

1872
01:09:25,099 --> 01:09:28,369
everybody here how to sell their own

1873
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:29,960
weed so you all know how to do business

1874
01:09:28,368 --> 01:09:31,969
you all know how to produce a product

1875
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,259
that the public wanted so what you want

1876
01:09:31,969 --> 01:09:36,170
to do now is just be able to kind of

1877
01:09:33,259 --> 01:09:38,748
readjust that shift and use the genetic

1878
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:40,880
tools that are available to you because

1879
01:09:38,748 --> 01:09:42,078
there's a lot of material available to

1880
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,298
be able to put yourself in situations

1881
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:46,528
where you can succeed

1882
01:09:45,298 --> 01:09:48,569
I think that's enough for the

1883
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:51,420
conversation so the main point is you

1884
01:09:48,569 --> 01:09:53,339
guys don't bow down don't get off get

1885
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,750
off your knees only only time you should

1886
01:09:53,338 --> 01:09:56,250
be on your knees is what if you're

1887
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:57,420
looking for your car keys because you

1888
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:59,430
dropped them out of your pocket

1889
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:02,100
and other than that and maybe and maybe

1890
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:04,320
as we stand under the crosshair as it

1891
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:10,140
falls and crucifies me from being shitty

1892
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:12,569
is in is in humility but not in begging

1893
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:14,700
for mercy from the market because no one

1894
01:10:12,569 --> 01:10:16,409
gives a shit about your struggle and the

1895
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:17,970
people that you're selling cannabis to

1896
01:10:16,409 --> 01:10:19,529
are going through the same beating you

1897
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:20,940
are but they've been going through it

1898
01:10:19,529 --> 01:10:23,609
for a long time because they've been

1899
01:10:20,939 --> 01:10:25,619
diminished in their wages and so most

1900
01:10:23,609 --> 01:10:28,079
people are taking a brutal beating and

1901
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:30,390
you don't get sympathy from people who

1902
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:32,309
are also in the same circumstance what

1903
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:34,920
you want to be able to do is give them

1904
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:37,620
some form of escapism some form of

1905
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,810
satisfaction some form of genuine

1906
01:10:37,619 --> 01:10:42,899
quality and those are the things that

1907
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:44,850
transcend and once you have that you're

1908
01:10:42,899 --> 01:10:46,199
gonna able to have a penetration that'll

1909
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:48,329
happen that allow you to move your

1910
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:50,250
products and then start to rebreathe in

1911
01:10:48,329 --> 01:10:53,880
your genetic libraries that you've held

1912
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:55,439
and built and nurtured and now you start

1913
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,569
to have an ability to where your father

1914
01:10:55,439 --> 01:10:59,879
only produces one thing the thing that

1915
01:10:57,569 --> 01:11:03,630
you know produces best on your farm and

1916
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:05,880
there's there's there's 1,700 people who

1917
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:08,730
buy the entire farms worth of product

1918
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:10,920
and then you're done for the season but

1919
01:11:08,729 --> 01:11:13,049
when you re release you re release the

1920
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:15,600
information and you can set up the

1921
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:19,440
desire the stores that want to carry it

1922
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,970
the prices will be there it's it's a

1923
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:22,889
reality if you look at every other

1924
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:24,990
market and so for me I'm somebody who

1925
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:27,720
was career hustler who said wow I'm

1926
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:30,840
gonna get buried alive let me study let

1927
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:33,820
me learn let me share and together we're

1928
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:45,550
gonna do it so it's gone

1929
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:51,298
