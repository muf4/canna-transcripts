1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,990
[Music]

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,650
yeah exactly that's a sybian same with

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,969
his Jamaican stuff that you get in

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,750
England and they would call it sense

5
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:18,509
Amelia

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,698
you know sensi yeah and it was like this

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,800
door you know like probably a really

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,590
good indica grown high in a cold

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,510
altitude well I can we as kids in

10
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,428
England we'd get like Hydra we'd grown

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,650
in Amsterdam and get you high but this

12
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:34,250
stuff would obliterate you and we would

13
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:37,079
pay a lot for a little Graham good

14
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,350
what's going on now I know it was a CB n

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,390
the whole time VPN is the culprit my

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,039
love of hashes TPN you know it's I

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:52,649
really come to appreciate that kind of

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:59,308
annoying stall of them ya know you hit

19
00:00:52,649 --> 00:01:01,129
on the head if I didn't have a thousand

20
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:05,128
milligrams of tincture in me right now

21
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:07,289
no that is the thing you know yeah for

22
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,100
anybody suffering from anxiety or

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:15,030
anything like that

24
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:17,429
see it's EPS so I take the brick press

25
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,810
and I heat it in a natural process just

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:28,590
using boiling water I was talking about

27
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:30,329
that that around paddy know so starting

28
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,030
materials raw so that's been pressed

29
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:35,188
already in a different press but

30
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,500
starting material is exactly this it's a

31
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:40,139
raw material this has never been pressed

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,489
or heated so this is a cold extract

33
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:47,640
product this would be non activated yeah

34
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:49,798
completely moms in a carboxyl so that is

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,509
non psychoactive it know you could eat

36
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:57,840
this right now and a little bit

37
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:59,909
psychoactive but but not not super high

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,640
levels the minute you add heat in this

39
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,250
process or any pressing process you're

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,899
converting in decarboxylate in so then

41
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,550
you've been making it you're essentially

42
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,280
taking off that carbon molecule to make

43
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,620
it bioavailable and then this process

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,280
you're just applying about three

45
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,580
for tons of pressure and a heated square

46
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,919
mold it has about 120 grams in it and

47
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,019
you just leave it for about 10 minutes

48
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,848
so the heat can really you know it

49
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,140
really activated I mean you know what

50
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:30,750
everyone loves about hash does that

51
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:31,919
activate in principle love it so I like

52
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,060
to leave it about 10 minutes and then

53
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,219
you get it on you get a really nice

54
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,229
break and it's very reminiscent of the

55
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,359
Moroccan style of pressing off it so

56
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:41,250
anybody that's from that part of the

57
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,409
world or anybody who ever smoked hash in

58
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,019
Europe when they see a brick like this

59
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:48,899
sliced up they all of a sudden get that

60
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,420
nostalgic little moment of oh shit I

61
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,819
remember that from Amsterdam it's a very

62
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,589
manual process does it need to be are

63
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:58,108
they're automated I mean it doesn't need

64
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,140
to be I'm not exactly sure how how

65
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:03,629
automated you could make it to the

66
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,798
beauty of all of this stuff from my from

67
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:06,568
from my point of view one of the

68
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,340
beauties is you guys is the fact that it

69
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:10,708
is artisanal and the scalability is

70
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,229
limited yeah you know but yeah I'm sure

71
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,939
yeah I always imagined in my head

72
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:17,128
because the temple ball process is very

73
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:18,359
very laborious which is part of the

74
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:19,949
beauty of it right you're putting all

75
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,900
that intention into it so you know we

76
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,429
could even get spiritual yeah but let's

77
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,870
forget that for a second it's laborious

78
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,609
and I've always thought you know what

79
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,480
kind of machine could you make and it

80
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:28,709
would kind of be like you would

81
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,840
basically have to replicate the

82
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,989
intestinal tract of a rabbit because all

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,729
you need is little poop balls inside and

84
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,769
you put the hatch in one end and the

85
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:50,250
other end to get little footballs so be

86
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:54,329
a machine like that like is a gram the

87
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,609
ideal like you know sailing a selling

88
00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:03,329
point for because I'm not you know to me

89
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:06,329
it's like you know let's call BCC and

90
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:08,250
tell ya one of the biggest reasons we

91
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,319
are restricted to a gram is because

92
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,269
we're not allowed as a manufacturer of

93
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,750
extracts to exceed a thousand milligrams

94
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:17,879
in our total dosage gotcha so yeah our

95
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,098
products were now ranging between 600

96
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,629
and 700 total milligrams so you know

97
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:22,500
maybe we could do one at one point two

98
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,209
grams but

99
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:33,240
that would be kind of weird so that's

100
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:34,859
kind of why we're there no extract

101
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,819
whether it's oil

102
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:44,639
whether it's butane hexane alcohol

103
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:46,199
anything can exceed the thousand

104
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,139
milligrams in fact it goes with

105
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:54,930
tinctures as well so you're talking

106
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:58,469
about this size so nobody can make like

107
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,730
a big bowl you know but the cool things

108
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,650
you can do and what we're gonna start

109
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,540
experimenting with is like mixing so

110
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:05,370
when you have the traditional carrying

111
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,620
method you get to certain darker types

112
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,689
yeah and then use the vacuum freezer you

113
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,668
get a very blond one yeah so what I want

114
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:14,430
to do and again the blonde one will have

115
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:16,680
a lot less CBN naturally yeah there's

116
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,480
just part of that natural curing process

117
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,980
you're getting the CBN but putting that

118
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,540
aside for a second what I want to do is

119
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,980
I want to then braid the two different

120
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,780
distinct colors together and then cut

121
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:28,410
them so you'll end up with like a sort

122
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:29,789
of like a floral really uh what is

123
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,740
something different but when you think

124
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,990
about it you can buy as many of these or

125
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,030
pretty much as I mean you can buy two or

126
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,160
three of these different grams so it

127
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:41,069
makes no sense for you to not be able to

128
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,620
sell a two and a three not brand baller

129
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:46,290
job whatever attendant yeah no one's

130
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,379
good things like rosin especially that

131
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,669
you know in dabbled products I mean I

132
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,110
know there's a lot of people out there

133
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:58,529
who would love that and they got used to

134
00:05:52,110 --> 00:06:00,569
that you know be shame or the BCC you

135
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:02,489
know lordy more closer because it's

136
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:05,180
across the street yeah I'm gonna do that

137
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,180
I'll be right back

138
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:20,490
exactly I mean not exactly

139
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,228
the brigade's trick in the California

140
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,120
equivalent the difference the only

141
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:26,829
biggest difference is the fact that

142
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,139
they're using a dry sift product to

143
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:31,478
start with and we're using a cold water

144
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:34,240
extracted product to start right now the

145
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,478
pressing process exactly the same and

146
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,689
that's what you got yeah and you get a

147
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:42,699
break a chain and this one didn't come

148
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:58,029
out as homogenized as I would like so I

149
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:59,710
would probably France and Spain I mean

150
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:02,769
when we're kids in Spain when we were

151
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:04,899
lucky we would smoke brick - because the

152
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:07,389
alternative was what we would call Babu

153
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:10,149
ha which says bubble and what bubble

154
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,710
refers to is the 2 or level and that was

155
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:14,529
the type of hash that was routinely

156
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:17,019
smuggled into the country using ingested

157
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:18,698
means so they would ingest it in pellets

158
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,258
and then they went of course have to

159
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,840
wait till they came up the other end now

160
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:25,240
as a consumer you know and they've done

161
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:28,750
tests in and you know modern times in

162
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:32,168
fact a few years ago and over 85 or 86

163
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:34,810
percent of all hash in Madrid had you

164
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:36,339
know e coli and feces in it so you know

165
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,689
there was that and it did smell like

166
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:39,489
shit

167
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:43,930
when we were lucky we had the brick hash

168
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:45,879
but usually we had to a sash but that

169
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:51,329
was growing up in Spain for you we did

170
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:53,680
not complain we did not complain exactly

171
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:55,329
at this point I would probably know if

172
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,668
this was perfect which it isn't

173
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:59,740
I would probably freeze dry it or me not

174
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:02,168
freeze-dried sorry vacuum seal it and

175
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,840
then and then keep it in a in a nice

176
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:08,288
environment where you can cure up but

177
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:10,658
you know just a little house for easy

178
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:13,538
packaging and then a consumers like it

179
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:15,250
so sorry show show me the grabbed Apple

180
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:18,709
oh I'm coming too

181
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:26,478
that's the starting material and that's

182
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:28,698
the end product and the break and we can

183
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:32,168
even do a nice little slice of the brick

184
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:46,669
which is always fun to do and so so the

185
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:49,639
oh my guess not decarboxylated no it's

186
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:54,229
not it's all THC a and then what about

187
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:56,569
the brick obviously it's all THC you

188
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,789
mean just that process decarboxylated

189
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,560
the whole thing um in this regard

190
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,269
probably yeah most of it I mean you're

191
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:06,169
adding a lot of heat there's 300 degrees

192
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:07,759
in there I'm sorry so those so those

193
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:10,189
plates because I missed the first part

194
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:15,588
you basically boiled the plates yes sir

195
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:17,120
and then that gets the ones gets a

196
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:20,420
boiling point then you can make probably

197
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,039
three or four bricks from it before it

198
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:27,439
cools before it cools down yes you know

199
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:30,319
definitely the science of it is more

200
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,970
tradition than science but this was the

201
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,790
traditionally now what we do for our

202
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:38,420
purposes at Cali hash is we don't

203
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:41,088
actually use this method at all we use a

204
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:43,278
temple balling method where the raw

205
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:48,470
material is taken by each person and

206
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:57,259
it's you know per gram uniquely pressed

207
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:58,278
by each hash machine each person yeah so

208
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:00,649
they would start with a product like

209
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:02,389
this and then you would take a gram

210
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:04,339
worth you put in the palm of your hand

211
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:07,929
with gloves obviously and then apply

212
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:07,930
heat and pressure and a motion like this

213
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:51,419
I don't overdo hard and do it sit sit on

214
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:51,419
that out yeah all right pressing hash

215
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,620
and nice somewhere we can cut this break

216
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,300
yeah this would be the traditional

217
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,250
method so here you go you have more or

218
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:01,990
less a gram you would put it in and this

219
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,720
is very traditional because obviously in

220
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,840
the hubbub all originates from Nepal and

221
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,210
in the Asian continent so traditionally

222
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,740
they would take a chunk and then they

223
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,800
would literally did exactly what we're

224
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,379
doing and then once you get it into a

225
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,939
into a homogenized or slightly

226
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:22,000
modernized state and you can go like

227
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:26,230
this you start doing them this motion

228
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,940
and this is really the magic and then

229
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,399
you know if you want to get spiritual

230
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:35,680
with it yet you think a little bit about

231
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:38,379
good things and you hope and all those

232
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:41,379
good intentions get translated into your

233
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:43,840
your ball of hash and really the best

234
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:45,159
balls are made with you know quite a lot

235
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,649
of pressure and the guys should get

236
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:49,689
really good at this you know get get

237
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:52,870
calluses and you know we're doing 200

238
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,370
these a day you end up really uh you

239
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,039
know exerting yourself and there you end

240
00:11:54,370 --> 00:12:00,879
up with the temple ball it's essentially

241
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:03,279
it and then the temple ball is uh it's

242
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,289
probably the the main way we produce you

243
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,789
know all of our press material more and

244
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:09,219
more we're going to start doing Moroccan

245
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:12,589
style we're just having gotten

246
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,610
rocket style would be this brick okay so

247
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,220
essentially you're seeing two different

248
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:20,330
press methods by urine and then you

249
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,250
break that into one gram yeah then the

250
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,470
break you would cut it into skin six

251
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,600
quarters right now actually we just

252
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,600
released purple cream to the market and

253
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,180
that's an example of that process has

254
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,170
brick as brick and then cut into grim

255
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:38,299
squares sorry so you said the brick is

256
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:48,740
more Moroccan so what's the tempo ball

257
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:50,479
nepalese whole area those temples but

258
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,049
again traditionally they're not using

259
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,690
water and ice to get their extraction

260
00:12:53,049 --> 00:13:00,189
they're using dry sis so they're getting

261
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:04,430
the freshest trichomes off the plant and

262
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,779
then pressing them as quickly and

263
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:08,750
especially as they can

264
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:11,509
whereas we use cold water and ice to

265
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,519
extract a man sitting process and then

266
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:20,210
we press that process product so that's

267
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:22,460
just a slight difference I think they

268
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:24,200
already are and this plate technique and

269
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,360
you know and I wish there was a up to

270
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,879
speed on exactly what that is I'm not

271
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,470
but I've been hearing rumblings about

272
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,710
this new technique called the plate

273
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,930
technique and I mean I'm assuming it's

274
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,639
dry sip on the large plate with heat or

275
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:39,819
something and you know allows you to

276
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:43,220
probably do it more quickly or amounts

277
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:46,780
but you know the problem with the cold

278
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,779
water extraction is you have to make by

279
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:56,889
so you take the break out ya little

280
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:58,809
break I mean this hatch wasn't it very

281
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:01,720
oily - you can already see this is a

282
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:04,359
much earlier for much much much well you

283
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,860
know and that's determined by the wrist

284
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:12,370
this is a cure product this has been

285
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:13,810
caring for a month I have a massive

286
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,750
amount of the people who won butter

287
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:19,299
products is just butter it's still 70

288
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,909
percent yeah yeah yeah they're sure it's

289
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:23,620
just been but yeah I don't I don't and

290
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:26,500
it's funny because now I have all these

291
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,850
traditional Arabs from Saudi Arabia and

292
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,549
now they're getting used to this

293
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,320
buttered stuff because the reality is

294
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:34,750
and you see right now I can exemplify it

295
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,830
perfectly as reality is when it butters

296
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:41,919
as opposed to a super oily product it's

297
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:44,139
really easy to distribute into whatever

298
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,120
ya whatever method you're trying to

299
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:48,879
distribute so imagine if I buy this gram

300
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,610
for example from Cali hash and I'm a

301
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:56,559
tobacco smoker of hash right if I had

302
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:58,240
this temple ball I gotta sit there for

303
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,209
him buy this and just crumble it and

304
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,710
it's buttered and it has 600 600

305
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,050
milligrams of categories just like the

306
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,519
other one and it butters and it's

307
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:08,289
crumbles the same and I'm getting the

308
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,600
same effect in rubble it's a tiny little

309
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:12,669
pre-roll exactly and you know more and

310
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,440
more I don't want that better yeah yeah

311
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:16,029
actually the pre rolls rolls better

312
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,910
because there's more air in between

313
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:20,139
exactly and even and then look if you

314
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:20,500
have a lighter if you get threw me a

315
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:22,299
lighter

316
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:27,220
I mean

317
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:28,958
there you know it's oil immediately and

318
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,928
it does you know it'll boil up

319
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,878
incredibly fast and that's another thing

320
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:36,068
that I've actually never talked about

321
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,199
really with you Peter is the the whole

322
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:41,318
origin of the bubble the name bubble

323
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:42,909
hash you know it all comes from the fact

324
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:45,099
that it bubbles when you put a lighter

325
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:46,688
to it and you know and that was

326
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,209
literally the age-old test and I've been

327
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:51,639
buying hash for fucking 20 plus years

328
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:54,219
now and the angel dust is to stick a

329
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,318
lighter on it and if you got bubbles you

330
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,869
got a wiggle if you don't got bubbles

331
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:00,578
you got plant material and fiber and

332
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:02,678
your average hash that's made from dry

333
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:06,128
sift out of the traditional markets is

334
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:07,119
between 30 and 40 percent 50 percent oil

335
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,399
if you're lucky

336
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:12,220
most of our high-end California made

337
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:15,068
stuff is in the you know 50s to 70s and

338
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,290
then your premium 710 labs fresh frozen

339
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:19,058
whole plant stuff is getting 85 and

340
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:21,519
above yeah you know so it really is the

341
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:22,778
full spectrum of qualities and resin

342
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,980
yeah in resin count

343
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:25,149
yeah it's all about how many heads can

344
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,709
you successfully get off the plan

345
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:29,259
without taking plant material with it

346
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:31,359
that is the whole goal of hash making

347
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:33,188
getting resin glands off the plant

348
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,829
without taking plant material with it

349
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:37,928
that's it and this is a perfect example

350
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,368
I mean this had this hash you know some

351
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:40,990
people might say oh that looks cakey

352
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:43,149
well you know what it's actually an oil

353
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,579
buttered product just like how wax will

354
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:47,230
butter you know it doesn't the Oriole

355
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:49,118
it's not speaking to the oil content if

356
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,159
you put a lighter to this it immediately

357
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:53,829
butters and it merely bubbles where did

358
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:55,088
that come close up of this Peter yeah so

359
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:57,698
the bubbling you know that and that's

360
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:59,319
bubble hash you know for the bubble that

361
00:16:57,698 --> 00:17:02,409
it needs to bubble to be called bubble

362
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:04,838
ha where did that come from was that was

363
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:06,459
that just flying around that little

364
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:08,230
temple ball no I just mean this oh you

365
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,269
get out of watch from other words on the

366
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,099
table okay and you see there's actually

367
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:14,288
a little more bubble going on on this

368
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,849
one as we probably assumed cuz the oil

369
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:18,429
content looks like a little higher but

370
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:21,519
same thing this is also accurate product

371
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:23,019
all of these are cured and as they sure

372
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:26,278
they butter more that is the natural

373
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:26,278
process of oil as

374
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:33,140
so yeah this is that product that we we

375
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:36,109
already kind of broke up over here and I

376
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,400
can do a bit more to exemplify you know

377
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:39,709
all of a sudden when you have a buttered

378
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,320
product it becomes a lot easier the best

379
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,759
way yeah someone was smoking a few

380
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,829
joints a day of hash

381
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,359
especially the tobacco smokers and

382
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:49,220
there's a lot of those traditional hash

383
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,359
people love to mix it with tobacco and

384
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,569
it doesn't go great together

385
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:54,949
yeah this is just much better and then

386
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:56,899
you put a lighter to it and you can

387
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,400
really see that the oil content is there

388
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,960
as much as you can say it looks like a

389
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,509
drier product or whatnot

390
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,579
it's just buttered and the oil content

391
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:06,559
is just hidden what do we mean by

392
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:08,750
buttered what is buttered is you know

393
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,539
it's comes from wax terminology and

394
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,240
waxes butane made extracts and what

395
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:16,399
happens with a stabilized wax product is

396
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,549
the hydrocarbons in it so that's all the

397
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,670
fats they butter it's the the cells open

398
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:24,589
and the actual structure and this is you

399
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,720
know very rudimentary chemistry I'm not

400
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:29,329
a chemist the actual structure itself

401
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,640
changes and that process what you end up

402
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:35,419
with is a creamy product that isn't

403
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,640
crystal or clear all oils will

404
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,259
eventually do that regardless I think

405
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,600
you've been olive oil eventually does

406
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:43,789
that um you know or if you add if you

407
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,409
add oxygen to it you can whit boils in

408
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,750
the same sort of process happens I mean

409
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:51,170
you can butter an MCT oil by just

410
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:52,519
homogenizing and adding air um but yeah

411
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,740
sensing when you refer to them in

412
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:56,869
extracts you referring to the process of

413
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,329
it going from a very clear waxy product

414
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:01,219
to a creamier looking product and fur

415
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:03,949
hash it for hash it's when it goes from

416
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,509
that dark oily sticky hash that you

417
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,759
can't get off your fingers to something

418
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:10,819
that you can literally pick up grab a

419
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:13,450
corner of and go like this and you still

420
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:15,889
have your 600 700 milligrams in there

421
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,600
and that's it you know and more and more

422
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,560
it's ironic because that first people

423
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,139
always

424
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,819
refer to this as the traditional hash or

425
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,110
oily your product and of course I want

426
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:26,960
the oilier stuff and the stuff that

427
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:28,219
looks ordinary but you know more often

428
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,539
than not I'll get people coming back and

429
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,039
they'll be like you know the ease of

430
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:33,289
this one is actually getting me to like

431
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,639
this one more so you know in the end of

432
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:37,279
the day it's you want to satisfy

433
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,870
everybody so we try to replicate the

434
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,549
people they came before us this is the

435
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:43,279
Nepalese style this is the Moroccan

436
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:44,839
style and then we know when we do it in

437
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,680
a modern way so it's a little bit

438
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:51,349
different but yeah now what were you

439
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,240
using your pre-rolls pre-rolls we will

440
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:57,079
use e there are a butter product or a

441
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,120
raw vacuum freezer product so when we

442
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:00,619
use the vacuum freezer for our curing

443
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,509
process everything you see here right

444
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:04,879
now is churned in the traditional way

445
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:06,589
now doing that gives you more higher

446
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,590
levels of certain cannabinoids that we

447
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:12,259
love but it actually depletes the

448
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:14,240
terpenes and we love turkeys who doesn't

449
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:17,539
love flavors and flavors also have

450
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,670
effects so when you're preserving the

451
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:22,069
original terpene profile in some of our

452
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,990
raw line we use a vacuum freezer and the

453
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:26,509
ones it's very obvious anything you see

454
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:30,470
that it's very white very clear not

455
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:32,359
oxidized that is vacuum frozen so when

456
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,670
it's still wet by the water because it's

457
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:37,429
water extracted and you cure it in the

458
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:40,670
natural process in atmosphere you're

459
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:42,950
allowing that water to oxidize the oil

460
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,390
and it changes the cannabinoids it

461
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,759
changes the structure of them and

462
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,759
changes it actually creates EBM and it

463
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:51,559
changes more than that THC ve a bunch of

464
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,539
different things a lot of the things

465
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,339
that people associate with hash and its

466
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:58,129
effects are those changes what about

467
00:20:55,339 --> 00:21:00,139
flavor flavor you lose the turkeys and

468
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:02,360
you get actually that one hash in

469
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,190
terpene and that's actually a thing I

470
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:06,919
know it sounds crazy but there is a

471
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,750
terpene called hashing and it's that

472
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,640
flavor that earthy flavor because I

473
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,980
really I have a hard time describing as

474
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,400
anything else it's incredibly earthy and

475
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:19,400
barnyard e in a good way and that that's

476
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,990
hashing and that will even if you start

477
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,810
with in my experience if you start with

478
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,549
this to prove turkey hash that's fruity

479
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:27,379
and it has like those really prominent

480
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:28,819
either citric or fruity notes either

481
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,180
cherry those ones that are really

482
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:33,919
prominent um after six months of Kurian

483
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,200
it'll be replaced by hash in by that

484
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,980
point your aged product almost always

485
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:42,049
turns into that super hashing heavy cbn

486
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:46,190
glistening almost starting to

487
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:50,980
crystallize in a way yeah the joy of

488
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,980
this product is that it always changes

489
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,780
yeah this one didn't come out as good as

490
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:58,129
I was hoping but again it was buttered

491
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:00,259
what do you mean by it's good you mean

492
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,030
like a visually well yeah you know even

493
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:05,119
me even though I get actually more

494
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:06,710
orders for this now I'm still you know

495
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:10,549
in my heart I just love how it looks

496
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:12,529
when it's dripping how does this go out

497
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:14,539
under the Morgan is it in chunks or do

498
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:17,480
you uh if we were making it for Callie

499
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:19,609
hash in the lab yeah we would slice it

500
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,579
and then turn it into small little gram

501
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:24,619
squares oh okay or temple boss Oh

502
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:26,659
today we predominantly done what is it

503
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:28,369
ball like they said like still this

504
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,350
collar and this consistent by the temple

505
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:32,089
ball yeah okay yeah and we've had those

506
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,709
I mean right now a lot of our product

507
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:35,480
will take it to market it will be super

508
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,400
oily and glistening or just by the

509
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,190
natural process especially if it's the

510
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,320
summer and the dispensary is hot or the

511
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,850
distribution didn't have a you know a

512
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,619
direct route or something you know

513
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:47,689
there's always these instances where the

514
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:50,359
product will butter in the process of

515
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,100
getting to market Oh awesome um but yeah

516
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:53,779
I mean generally speaking we like to get

517
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:57,379
the oiliest product out the freshest

518
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:59,539
product out you know unfortunately for

519
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,670
six months we didn't have a lab so up

520
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:03,889
until a month ago we were wounded Wow

521
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,529
and we were just working off of old

522
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:10,790
inventory so anybody out there who

523
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:11,420

526
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:18,889
we appreciate the little guys support

527
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:24,140
being the little guy means you don't

528
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:26,720
have your lap you found another lap so

529

530
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:36,170
process so Fred loves yes now fred is

531
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,940
gonna be our rosin press room we're

532
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,500
doing we're launching rosin in January

533
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,960
with the pre roll line both things were

534
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,970
being launched at the same time right

535
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,819
now I mean we in fact are testing some

536
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:50,990
of we can test right now some of them

537
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:52,819
Fred to product right here I've been

538
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,259
smoking on it all week there's actually

539
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:56,839
a couple weeks now this is the purple

540
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:59,119
cream that's currently in cali hash in

541
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:01,679
the market you can buy this product in

542
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:04,379
the dispensary on the

543
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,600
the hash product and then we pressed it

544
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,160
ourselves in-house of course you can

545
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,319
press it at home with the heat press

546
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,529
from your wife but that's a whole

547
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,599
different tutorial here you can just you

548
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:18,180
can just look at me smoking it but

549
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,159
that's right there it's a very nice you

550
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,630
know a beige generally with hash rods

551
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,300
and you're gonna get a slightly darker

552
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:26,580
color now this was cured in a vacuum

553
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:28,829
feeds or all of our hash rosin is cured

554
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:30,539
in a vacuum freezer we don't do it any

555
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:32,579
other traditional way because during the

556
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,659
during the pressing process of rasa and

557
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:37,589
you're getting those cannabinoids that

558
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:39,720
you want anyway so with rosin what we

559
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:43,949
really are aiming for its flavor profile

560
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:49,559
over everything because it's just so

561
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:51,690
deliciously flavorful same thing with

562
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:52,829
our raw line whereas with our press line

563
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,630
we're really going after those

564
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:56,279
cannabinoids we're really trying to you

565
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,680
know eventually we'll be we'll be

566
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:02,579
releasing aged things you know one year

567
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:04,080
two years yeah things like that focusing

568
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:06,419
on that whereas the raw line really

569
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,250
focuses on terpene profile like those

570
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,090
runs and it's hot right now isn't it

571
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,559
yeah yeah

572
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:11,730
anything char you're gonna be good

573
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,450
finish that actually we're gonna do a

574
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:17,490
cold curing absolutely absolutely on the

575
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:19,500
rosin and the sauces the part of the

576
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:21,420
process is a lot of cold curing you know

577
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,119
to do diamonds we have to cold cure and

578
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,860
we'll be doing all of that hmm so it's

579
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,359
just no it's delicious just delicious

580
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:29,699
yeah yeah

581
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,679
that's the purple cream we currently

582
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,450
have a pressed version and a raw version

583
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,560
but if you buy that at the dispensary at

584
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,950
home you could press it and we're

585
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,690
getting 60% out so Wow yeah and right

586
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,640
now in the market you can it's hard to

587
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:45,210
find a good gram of rosin for less than

588
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:48,509
60 70 bucks yeah so buying a gram of

589
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:51,720
cavy hash for 30 bucks I'm pressing it

590
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:54,119
at home speaking yeah yeah yeah wait

591
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:59,579
till we released the Raza well release

592
00:25:54,119 --> 00:26:01,500
it into it well we're gonna try to bring

593
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:04,038
it as low as possible as over I mean we

594
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,509
are not about gouging or not about

595
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:07,308
we're not here to make profits we don't

596
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:08,720
have to to shareholders I'm not

597
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:10,700
answering to some million dollar if it's

598
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,639
a more labor-intensive process isn't it

599
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,710
yeah yeah and for that reason we have to

600
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:17,839
charge someday I mean what I can always

601
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,028
assure you is that we are charging the

602
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:23,089
minimal possible I've never paid myself

603
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:24,349
a salary I pay my employees well and we

604
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:26,329
take care of them because they're very

605
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,738
important but other than that none of

606
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:30,589
the partners who started the business

607
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:33,019
have ever looked at a dollar you know

608
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,528
and we're not looking at it as a piggy

609
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:35,599
bank

610
00:26:33,528 --> 00:26:37,249
or some sort of revenue generator where

611
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:41,598
we're in it to build a really reliable

612
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:44,960
brand long term yeah I take it very

613
00:26:41,598 --> 00:26:46,848
seriously you know yeah I mean I'm a

614

618
00:26:56,569 --> 00:26:59,689
would that be guys like established

619
00:26:58,098 --> 00:27:01,098
Kalle Hodge could you've been three

620
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,298
years ago for a long time

621
00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:03,798
three years ago I came up with the name

622
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:07,878
Cali ash and started the branding of

623
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:09,918
kalakashi South but like four years ago

624
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:19,428
did you say I know I'm gonna I want to

625
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:34,899
go down this is like when you go to a

626
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:38,889
camera store Peter a magnificent Peter

627
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:42,589
who is handling the camera so this is a

628
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:45,528
rosin made by our in-house passion maker

629
00:27:42,589 --> 00:27:47,569
named Fred and this is made from our

630
00:27:45,528 --> 00:27:51,079
purple cream product or raw purple cream

631
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:54,259
product that's the rosin it's incredibly

632
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:56,868
Torpy it has just a berry very fruity

633
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:59,298
finish a lot of cherry going along a lot

634
00:27:56,868 --> 00:28:03,249
of berries going on and we just place it

635
00:27:59,298 --> 00:28:03,249
inside our lovely puffs go peek

636
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:16,070
and it's ready to go I buzzed yeah I

637
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:19,490
think once it heats up it doesn't do

638
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:27,619
that anymore well really or it's not

639
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:30,079
yeah yeah you know I was always I was

640
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:32,089
always against wax I never dabbed until

641
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,069
I realized there is a salt in the Sun

642
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:35,569
yeah until you could really take solving

643
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:37,669
this to this extreme level then now I

644
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:40,519
realize you can take it to anything you

645
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:42,259
can make with the butane hexane alcohol

646
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:46,668
product just living with it we can make

647
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:48,589
solvent less yeah yeah that's the

648
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:56,660
challenge yeah it's a brave new world

649
00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:57,889
yeah yeah that's a big one that started

650
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,750
again do you know how to do the buttons

651
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,669
on this we do it three times a is it

652
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:06,380
twice or three yeah you got it like a

653
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:09,080
quick double strong work Fred yes it is

654
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,820
oh and I actually have some examples of

655
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,129
some other stuff that Fred press but you

656
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:18,019
know when you press a cure hash product

657
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:18,799
you end up with a much more oxidized end

658
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:46,429
product

659
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:49,759
no is that a bad thing yeah very dark

660
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:52,309
product you can look at this is the hash

661
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:57,558
rosin made with I think is actually made

662
00:29:52,308 --> 00:30:00,769
with this but this would be very high in

663
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:04,819
CBN and it would be incredibly high in

664
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:06,769
hashing the terpene hash this would

665
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:09,529
knock you out and you know other than

666
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:12,798
the intense hash flavor which hashing is

667
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:15,319
gives you you know it's probably my

668
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:16,789
favorite thing to smoke now is it super

669
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:19,039
enjoyable in terms of like fruity

670
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:21,349
profile no of course not right it tastes

671
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,359
like hash right but if you like to buy

672
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:29,379
it at if you

673
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:31,479
the flavor of a good old shoe then

674
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,370
you're like you know this type of care

675
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,259
has wrong about it and that's why when I

676
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:37,149
met Frenchie again after because I

677
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:39,369
thought I would never experience the

678
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:41,410
taste of that 11 old Lebanese hash again

679
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:42,399
which I did what I won't see the

680
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:48,130
difference do you see the difference I

681
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:52,480
mean it's I love it still yeah well it's

682
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:59,080
the only difference apparently it's more

683
00:30:52,480 --> 00:31:01,360
CBN and the only difference is the bed

684
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:03,039
with the with the purple cream actually

685
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,639
I had both next to each other right here

686
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,769
hmm

687
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,410
so the purple cream on the right here is

688
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:11,049
to see is so different on this side you

689
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,330
have its venom bowl a it's done with the

690
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:17,980
back kids like a boy so with a vacuum

691
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:19,899
freezer right so this never oxidized so

692
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:23,289
the trichome even up to the point of

693
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:25,810
pressing never oxidize that's the only

694
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:27,339
difference this stuff or this stuff on

695
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:30,220
the on the other side the same is this

696
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:31,899
yeah this is Donald a cured product so

697
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,720
the beginning product of this middle one

698
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,130
was white if you buy our purple cream

699
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,720
raw right now it's white even though

700
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,370
most of the oven home right now that you

701
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,319
probably don't like that one would in

702
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:42,849
the beginning was white but if you look

703
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:45,579
at the dates on it that was produced I

704
00:31:42,849 --> 00:31:47,980
think a year ago that's why we've had

705
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:49,899
such issues in the last six months and

706
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,059
that's why when I extend my apology as

707
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,120
well this is maybe me reading into it

708
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:58,029
but I got one complaint and I take it

709
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:59,679
very sad very sensitive we got one

710
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:01,569
complaint someone said that they

711
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,490
actually really was displeased with it

712
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:04,779
and it was actually the moment most that

713
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,150
they mentioned in particular and this

714
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:08,559
was about three weeks ago and and I just

715
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:11,050
wanted to speak to you on this Peter cuz

716
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,149
I took it so badly I mean it was floored

717
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:16,990
me and so I think this incredibly

718
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:19,780
seriously this is my baby I like it good

719
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,920
I do thought you get better as my points

720
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:24,490
oh okay

721
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:27,039
even today on what fred was packaging i

722
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:29,170
was really excited about it you know it

723
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,940
was just a cure product where the heads

724
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:33,250
were all obvious where you could see it

725
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,100
each head individually and we did the

726
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,048
traditional care

727
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:37,879
this one we left it in raw form but you

728
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:39,500
can actually see every head and and

729
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,910
they've all oxidized a little bit so

730
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,390
they have that beautiful profile and

731
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:46,279
that glisten um so you know again some

732
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:48,470
of our stuff was ki fee and that is

733
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:52,250
literally the word the person used and I

734
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:54,529
agree is there a part of this we go the

735
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:58,819
way we make our hash you know it's not a

736
00:32:54,529 --> 00:33:01,250
it's not a uniform process it's not it's

737
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:04,548
artisinal is artistic convene and so

738
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:07,279
that's right and so you know we're

739
00:33:04,548 --> 00:33:09,259
obviously going for consistency you know

740
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:14,389
it's gonna only get better but in an

741
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:16,908
artisanal process you know there's that

742
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,830
happens yes you know it happens with one

743
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:21,110
another you know it happens and that's

744
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:23,569
it and I appreciate that so I mean and

745
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:25,399
we again we are the little guy we were

746
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:26,990
you know we're gonna be here and we're

747
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,179
only gonna get better so it gives us a

748
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:31,759
trajectory as well so you know I I

749
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:33,429
definitely want to give a nod to nosh I

750
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,419
want to give him not to seven ten labs

751
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:37,009
you know they're they're they're

752
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:38,960
companies that are doing exceptional

753
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:41,629
work and the stuff in the space there

754
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,759
are companies that I aspire to and I

755
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:46,580
have no problem to admit that Frenchy

756
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,250
included and you know yeah I know I'm

757
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:49,908
happy to be part of this community

758
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:54,470
solvent list forever

759
00:33:49,909 --> 00:34:03,020
those cookies solvent lissa product that

760
00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:04,519
we saw at yeah did you partake know what

761
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:09,679
saw what product did they use did you

762
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:13,730
know was it a rasa it was so a do blue

763
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:16,220
eyes who came over from Spain to

764
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:19,070
basically run their solvent les okay so

765
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:21,199
he was experimenting and we had the

766
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:26,330
history of rosin event where he brought

767
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:27,769
like his first product that he is like

768
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:29,299
you know it's like different

769
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:31,128
consistencies different texture

770
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,339
different processing of a picture of

771
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:41,969
themselves too

772
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:45,239
I definitely did and so that's a

773
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:49,159
pneumatic actually it is a hydraulic

774
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:52,139
welded bottle jacks this is originally a

775
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:54,869
bottling jack that's been retrofitted by

776
00:34:52,139 --> 00:35:03,930
a by an industrious person who sells

777
00:34:54,869 --> 00:35:05,999
them on Amazon yeah you know yeah we you

778
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:07,679
know we're definitely you know this is

779
00:35:05,998 --> 00:35:11,699
all fun and games but in the lab under

780
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:13,228
the keen eye of BCC and in laboratory

781
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:15,689
conditions it all changes quite

782
00:35:13,228 --> 00:35:17,548
dramatically you know we don't use

783
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,960
anything with this kind of paint on it

784
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:22,349
and we all know everything stainless

785
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,818
steel you know we're required to test

786
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:26,068
everything every step of the way

787
00:35:23,818 --> 00:35:28,558
it is a different different environment

788
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:29,190
but it is still fun to see ash in

789
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,920
abundance

790
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:52,829
and free in the wild Romijn bouncing

791
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:57,420
around this one is this one is a F which

792
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:59,369
is not as fuck it's Afghani it but this

793
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,369
is one of our more popular streams I

794
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:05,940
mean people really clamor for this one

795
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:08,579
this is a an age-old favorite for any

796
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:15,630
hash head kind of prop it up over here

797
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:20,910
yeah yeah that's a nice little chunk a

798
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:23,818
hash now what what is what is that chunk

799
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:26,190
of hash is destiny so this will all be

800
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:28,679
sold to medical licensed medical

801
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:37,139
individuals in the state of California

802
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:38,248
of course next to some lucky patients

803
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:40,039
yeah exactly

804
00:36:38,248 --> 00:36:41,839
they still are and you know

805
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:44,300
with the prices as they are in

806
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,700
dispensaries I'm glad to still satisfy

807
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:49,400
some of the medical more because I truly

808
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:51,889
believes and even in Cali hashas case we

809
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,289
try our hardest to get the price as low

810
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:57,170
as possible and I'm very candid about it

811
00:36:54,289 --> 00:37:00,739
our price to the wholesaler is $12.50

812
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:02,420
including distribution so after that

813
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:03,859
point to the retailer excuse me

814
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,690
so that's to the whole that's to the

815
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,519
distributor we sell it for 1250

816
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,980
so they're selling it to the retailer at

817
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,780
1250 all included and that's the low as

818
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,210
we can get it as a company we're only

819
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:17,390
getting $10 of every of every unit and

820
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:20,059
then that $10 you know $2 goes to legal

821
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:22,009
four dollars goes to biomass to make it

822
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:23,840
and then there's $2 left to go to the

823
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,640
packagers so I mean as a company we're

824
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,700
not even making a profit that's not our

825
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:30,529
goal we're just trying to establish a

826
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:32,989
reliable trustworthy brand that that

827
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:35,450
says something that scans for something

828
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:37,099
anyway before I get to Ramon it would be

829
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:39,649
nice if you didn't have to deal with all

830
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:45,829
that stuff yeah if I could payments of a

831
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:48,800
salary would be fantastic this is purple

832
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:51,679
punch this one again like a week ago

833
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,990
this was incredibly oily probably my

834
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:55,940
earliest one you couldn't get your hands

835
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:59,119
off it without it being sticky today

836
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:02,030
it's completely buttered I mean

837
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,159
completely so the air and oxygen does

838
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:06,170
that well this days you have to take

839
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,059
long no this actually I think I said

840
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,680
about two weeks ago this looked entirely

841
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:11,690
like that glistening part but everywhere

842
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,419
I mean more glistening than these but

843
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:17,320
that's the case um usually the more oily

844
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:20,119
you know might not oil these up like

845
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,100
this one I mean this one will even melt

846
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:24,259
even more and it's even more butter Wow

847
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:26,630
really speaks to what I'm talking about

848
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:29,540
and then you really just it opens itself

849
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:34,309
up and you ended up with this really

850
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:42,920
fluffy creamy yet melty an extremely

851
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:45,630
bubbly purple punch

852
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,579
the more oily the product the faster it

853
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:50,190
does that in fact that's I would reckon

854
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:53,819
that's between 70 and 75 percent total

855
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:56,670
cannabinoids so essentially when you're

856
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,950
speaking about the 70 and 60 and 50%

857
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:01,200
lunch you're speaking of the ratio

858
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:05,250
between the plant material left and the

859
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,419
end product and the oil content and a

860
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,969
little bit of planning to do is not a

861
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,860
bad thing I'm a believer I love Rosslyn

862
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:14,579
and we're really happy to launch Rosslyn

863
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:17,340
in fact I'm a newly newly newly

864
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,989
converted Dabba names to always make fun

865
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,570
of all you dabbers out there and now I'm

866
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:23,159
getting Fred a ball the way it was fried

867
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:25,230
yeah you started pressing my own stuff

868
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:27,480
and I'm like this is fantastic so you

869
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:29,550
know there's definitely you know I'm

870
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,469
very excited about that but I'm but a

871
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:34,110
little bit of phytoplankton a little bit

872
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:36,059
of platformer a little bit of a little

873
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:38,220
bit of that stuff in the in the in in

874
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:39,960
the plant is truly full spectrum right

875
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:42,329
so if you really are talking about a

876
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,030
full spectrum product that truly

877
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:48,179
reflects the original plant but is an

878
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:49,980
extract cold water extraction is the

879
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:51,659
closest thing and when you're doing it

880
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,360
at those high levels of whole plant

881
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:55,859
fresh frozen you're really getting an 85

882
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,829
percent cannabinoid with a 50 percent

883
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:01,559
plant material and lipid and fat by

884
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:04,469
layers and that really is the for me

885
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:06,239
it's the Holy Grail coup de Gras the

886
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:08,039
best half is that where you have to get

887
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:12,209
the tops of the plates and freeze them

888
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:17,550
immediately yes and you can you have to

889
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:21,780
use nitrogen immediately or a flash

890
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:23,400
freezer if you just stick wet plants it

891
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,230
just takes the tripod think like a

892
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,970
trichome but a lot of people do that

893
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,840
they do it they call it fresh frozen ice

894
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:29,639
ain't gonna life

895
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,920
no if you're really doing fresh frozen

896
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:34,679
you're at least spending $40,000 on your

897
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,269
blast freezer so it's that or a nitrogen

898
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:37,559
how do you ensure that's being done you

899
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:40,440
have to go to their facility and look

900
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:42,570
this is never away never take anyone's

901
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,250
word for it and then when you take fresh

902
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:46,200
funds I don't believe the tops right I

903
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,300
mean they can be anything it can be a

904
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:51,119
whole plant okay and I like whole plant

905
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:53,010
um but what's very important is the

906
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,150
speed of freezing because if you allow

907
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,750
the trichome to say

908
00:40:54,150 --> 00:41:00,059
in a state of half frozen half wet it

909
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:04,829
becomes like a little dick you want that

910
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:07,740
frozen track home why it's going this

911
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,880
way but you want that thing up you

912
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:10,679
really do it you want this stock because

913
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,170
then when you're when you're cutting the

914
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:15,690
stock off of the plant it has that stem

915
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,730
to break the minute you've matched the

916
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,130
trichome head against the plant material

917
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:22,440
against the fiber of the plan then it's

918
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:26,099
a whole nother challenge to get it off

919
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,108
so yeah I mean in my experience actually

920
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:30,960
the best stuff isn't made with fresh

921
00:41:28,108 --> 00:41:33,808
frozen it's made with fresh fresh period

922
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,750
you literally go to your garden cut the

923
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:39,690
plant throw it in your process straight

924
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:43,289
to hash and what you get is incredible

925
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:44,519
results that's a great drip drip drip ID

926
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:46,920
but it has to be got there with the

927
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:49,500
right time with the most resonant hair

928
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,568
right and then there's really a lot of

929
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,179
nuance to it because again when you

930
00:41:51,568 --> 00:41:55,679
harvest a planting and I love to do this

931
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:58,828
things like the trichome you know get a

932
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,960
little Zen with it you know the trichome

933
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:04,619
even on the plant if you harvest the

934
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,990
plants a month prematurely you're

935
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:09,028
getting none of the kind of annoys you

936
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:10,709
want let's begin there so you have a

937
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:12,329
whole different type of product that's

938
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:14,278
why some people say that's why that's

939
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:17,190
why they say the plant literally tells

940
00:42:14,278 --> 00:42:19,559
that it does yeah and when the grower is

941
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:21,059
looking for those amber heading and I

942
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:23,819
think the average growers said between

943
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:25,440
60 and 70 percent amber at harvest and I

944
00:42:23,818 --> 00:42:27,329
agree that's probably the optimal time

945
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,369
because that ambereen what they're

946
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:32,130
speaking to is the creation of thtve

947
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:33,838
of cbn of those cannabinoids that we all

948
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,028
love and then it becomes a fully

949
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,699
district full spectrum product some of

950
00:42:36,028 --> 00:42:41,338
your your hash sets you know that's made

951
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:43,588
with these premature materials or or let

952
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:44,969
me refer to the to the wax market you

953
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:47,130
know what happened a lot in the wax

954
00:42:44,969 --> 00:42:48,538
market and this can be cooperated by

955
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:50,940
anybody who's been in this traditional

956
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:53,400
market for a long time Joe um good

957
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:56,670
timing they would literally take

958
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,528
premature plants and blast them and you

959
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:00,510
would end up with this white clear

960
00:42:58,528 --> 00:43:02,719
product they're basically trying to get

961
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:07,320
tricone yeah blast them with what

962
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:08,969
blasting refers to the process of butane

963
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,950
they would blast some of butane and use

964
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:12,929
beauty and extraction to end up with a

965
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:15,210
clear end product but what you end up

966
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:16,409
with is a one mono cannabinoid product

967
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:18,750
because none of the other categories

968
00:43:16,409 --> 00:43:20,429
have developed and so for that you know

969
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:22,019
it's always a bit of a trick and then

970
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:24,480
there's this weird print as this very

971
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:26,309
not weird there's this Universal idea

972
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,500
and it even falls on me that the cleaner

973
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:30,449
clearer the product cleaner or better

974
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,219
the product the less oxidized the

975
00:43:30,449 --> 00:43:33,889
product the better the product I am

976
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:36,480
gonna make it my life's mission to

977
00:43:33,889 --> 00:43:38,940
re-educate the population that is not

978
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,579
the case actually the best cannabinoids

979
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,840
are the oxidized ones

980
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:44,909
oxygen is an incredible thing you know

981
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,950
it gives us life that allows for all of

982
00:43:44,909 --> 00:43:49,230
this mammal you know fully body

983
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:50,730
reptilian and mammalian life it allowed

984
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,679
for all the evolution as you know it

985
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,690
from from the smallest things to become

986
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:57,319
the biggest things but it's the most

987
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:59,970
toxic element one of the most toxic

988
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:02,880
oxidization what that refers to is how

989
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:05,039
the on the atomic level oxygen has one

990
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,610
free-floating electron on its outer ring

991
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:11,279
by itself so literally any any any other

992
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:14,280
molecule or any other atom excuse me

993
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,410
that has any space on its outer ring for

994
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,630
that one molecule to that one electron

995
00:44:16,409 --> 00:44:20,489
to go into it bonds and that's what

996
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:23,490
that's what erosion is that's what

997
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:25,559
that's what oxidization is oxygen

998
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:28,379
ironically because it gives us life is

999
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:31,110
one of the most toxic elements on the

1000
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:33,150
table um it's it's interesting irony and

1001
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:35,730
then when it comes to cannabinoids it is

1002
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:37,710
our releaser it is our natural nature's

1003
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:39,840
laboratory of creating those

1004
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:43,550
cannabinoids that we all love and hold

1005
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:47,400
dear so oxidization is not bad

1006
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:50,400
how did it get such a bad rap wax BHO

1007
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:55,110
did it um they did it because there is a

1008
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,400
thing with freshness - speaking of also

1009
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,650
it can cause lots of sugar of

1010
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,210
oxidization exactly so if you don't want

1011
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:02,099
your wax to sugar a butter like we

1012
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,889
referred to before and in the in the

1013
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:07,409
nasan's wax market we're talking 2007

1014
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:09,359
whatever - a 12 yeah yeah what happen -

1015
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:11,190
are a good question on this sauce now

1016
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,349
well you know what you know what the

1017
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,809
true story of that is shatter is a

1018
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:16,599
longer process shatter involves ovens

1019
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:18,820
that are more call

1020
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:21,369
it's actually much cheaper to make sauce

1021
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,690
he's actually just people just maybe she

1022
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:27,960
convinced the market than one sauce

1023
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:27,960
because it's easier than me but you know

1024
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:54,000
blankets and scale Gerda screw ups you

1025
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:54,000
know it's harder to get up yeah Peter

1026
00:45:58,139 --> 00:46:02,440
yeah because you want yes they're still

1027
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:03,849
both quasars

1028
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,599
so we're not beautiful that way the

1029
00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:39,610
stuff that we use to smoke yeah I figure

1030
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:43,869
a bong is not a traditional form oh this

1031
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:51,849
is one of one but everyone that sees it

1032
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:54,489
does seem like it could be yours

1033
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:58,089
yeah I mean I've made a few prototype

1034
00:46:54,489 --> 00:47:00,609
things for us like Mike's got well no

1035
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:12,039
and you're holding a 101 oh yeah one

1036
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:14,160
beautiful iPhone case yeah if that goes

1037
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:19,199
viral that pillow

1038
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:19,199
yeah well we need to livestream like

1039
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:30,769
we imagine if you can sell like if you

1040
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:38,088
can sell interstate like Home Shopping

1041
00:47:30,769 --> 00:47:40,639
Network like today on the show yeah it's

1042
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:41,449
all really about curating then it's

1043
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,739
gonna be great

1044
00:47:41,449 --> 00:47:49,929
so what curating oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

1045
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:54,078
definitely I mean there ah I think so

1046
00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:58,489
and California is the Holy Grail just

1047
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:01,039
for everybody yeah careful singing on

1048
00:47:58,489 --> 00:48:02,929
other states okay okay I got girl her

1049
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:05,088
friends all over the country and the one

1050
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:07,039
thing that pisses them off no no of

1051
00:48:05,088 --> 00:48:08,779
course it doesn't what it's like we

1052
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:11,900
can't help it because we evening courier

1053
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:13,339
but you may know it's true that's that's

1054
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:16,160
something yeah we didn't we didn't

1055
00:48:13,338 --> 00:48:18,380
create our stigma the people who visited

1056
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,409
here created the stigma and took it

1057
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:24,108
elsewhere but wait what's the stigma

1058
00:48:21,409 --> 00:48:37,219
like California in terms of being a

1059
00:48:24,108 --> 00:48:39,259
pinnacle in canvas oh I miss using the

1060
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:39,889
word a little bit but it's the I guess

1061
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,650
affable

1062
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:45,529
no no it's yeah its reputation and the

1063
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:49,849
thing is is that like yes we know Maine

1064
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:53,060
has a very respectable cannabis culture

1065
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:56,150
going back many years and fine growers

1066
00:48:53,059 --> 00:48:59,259
in a real caregiver community yeah but

1067
00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:02,088
just as the industry ramps up you know

1068
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:04,839
people want a piece of that California

1069
00:49:02,088 --> 00:49:04,838
Manager

1070
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:14,860
so I'm packing a little bit of a just no

1071
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:18,700
tobacco notes it's not a well-known cut

1072
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:22,030
to call Scout cake yeah it's just uh one

1073
00:49:18,699 --> 00:49:23,889
of the countless crosses yeah for the

1074
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:27,670
countless property without any agent

1075
00:49:23,889 --> 00:49:30,969
crosses of crisis put a little bit of

1076
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:33,250
flour in the bottom and wait I'm sorry

1077
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:36,429
so food through this uh friend of mine

1078
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:38,440
drew this okay well I didn't I'm really

1079
00:49:36,429 --> 00:49:42,309
pleased to meet you guys be quite wise I

1080
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:46,659
had no idea who Cali hash was and I I

1081
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:49,840
like the bottom of that uh was worried

1082
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:53,829
that you were just like you know cashing

1083
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:56,550
in my if you like you're just cashing

1084
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:58,900
and doing do it as cheaply as possible

1085
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:01,120
you know what cuz I'd never write you

1086
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:03,309
know you know and just like with a lot

1087
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,769
of other people who in the session and

1088
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:07,960
and it's really really great to see that

1089
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:09,849
you are you're very subtly rehashing it

1090
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,010
but knowledgeable about the different

1091
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:14,199
process these in incorporating them into

1092
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:17,020
what you do and you really care about

1093
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:21,460
that and that you have the legacy

1094
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:24,849
information this is so G that is Grape

1095
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,510
Ape uh well so much is nice yes very

1096
00:50:24,849 --> 00:50:27,489
Turkey

1097
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:31,450
yeah so what I usually tell people

1098
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:33,219
especially people who who haven't been

1099
00:50:31,449 --> 00:50:35,079
smoking hash in years or people who are

1100
00:50:33,219 --> 00:50:37,419
who are flower people who are looking to

1101
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:39,279
extend their flower if you pair a gram

1102
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:41,920
of hash with about an eighth of flour

1103
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,530
that gram if you're smoking the hash

1104
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,210
every time you smoke your flower you may

1105
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:47,980
have a little bit of hash left over at

1106
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:49,750
the end of your eighth but you should

1107
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,610
about they should about finished around

1108
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:53,320
the same time so if you pair those

1109
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:55,269
together should make your eighth for

1110
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:58,269
however long in a classroom and should

1111
00:50:55,269 --> 00:51:00,789
make it last about twice as long so if

1112
00:50:58,269 --> 00:51:03,070
you're getting a thirty dollar gram then

1113
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:05,619
you're normally smoking $40 ace now

1114
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:06,910
you're saving ten bucks right so what I

1115
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:09,519
usually tell people if they want to

1116
00:51:06,909 --> 00:51:12,909
smoke it with a bong is only got to do

1117
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:16,929
is take you know a really tiny amount

1118
00:51:12,909 --> 00:51:17,559
and I mean you can put as much as you

1119
00:51:16,929 --> 00:51:20,079
want on it

1120
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:22,239
point one but if you're if you're if

1121
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,420
you're trying to just put it on your

1122
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:26,568
bong and have a nice little

1123
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:28,190
snap small amount of weed on it I mean

1124
00:51:26,568 --> 00:51:30,199
again you can fill it to the brim if

1125
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:32,088
you'd like but I'd like to taste my

1126
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:35,139
flower and taste my hash so I make

1127
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:38,088
smaller bowls Inter's packet more often

1128
00:51:35,139 --> 00:51:41,568
would that be the same for a pipe or any

1129
00:51:38,088 --> 00:51:42,949
Bowl that yeah okay yeah I know people

1130
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:44,869
like the packin big because they like to

1131
00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:48,259
pass it around with live West Coast is

1132
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:49,760
snap or snaps it really degrades the

1133
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:58,069
flavor that's an East Coast inning and

1134
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:59,510
if you appreciate the flavor but it was

1135
00:51:58,068 --> 00:52:01,608
more communal you would share a bowl

1136
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:03,589
that's right I'm Wes in western United

1137

States where we do snap but when I was

1138
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:06,588
younger we also had we did painters just

1139
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,970
a winner

1140
00:52:06,588 --> 00:52:09,889
we had these lengths of one in her

1141
00:52:07,969 --> 00:52:11,239
little little pipes that were incredible

1142
00:52:09,889 --> 00:52:14,509
while you could fit in there was that

1143
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:16,879
much okay actually I have a couple

1144
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:20,569
oh really yeah the chills I box of

1145
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,548
chilies are on this metal plate give

1146
00:52:20,568 --> 00:52:25,338
those children to people for free when

1147
00:52:22,548 --> 00:52:31,940
we do when we show up to dispensaries

1148
00:52:25,338 --> 00:52:35,358
kid I have one yeah but they're really

1149
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:39,250
they're just simple wonders it's perfect

1150
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:39,250
for you live in just hash the flour

1151
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:43,289
[Music]

1152
00:52:52,298 --> 00:52:59,509
they're so cheap that like giving a

1153
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:01,399
handful of them because if you get a

1154
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:03,589
handful of them you can just leave one

1155
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:10,670
or two of them soaking in alcohol while

1156
00:53:03,588 --> 00:53:12,558
you have your one that you're using yeah

1157
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:16,970
yeah we're like a barber and they're

1158
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:18,710
calm locker room yeah exactly and again

1159
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:20,328
since they're so cheap if you break and

1160
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:23,269
who cares if he's very good rest you

1161
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:26,589
know and yeah so when you smoke this

1162
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:26,588
just smoke it like any other bowl

1163
00:53:29,938 --> 00:53:35,588
so hand on that one oh if that wasn't

1164
00:53:33,429 --> 00:53:41,459
such a death though yeah that one needs

1165
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:41,458
a little love but you know yeah oh yeah

1166
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:50,050
now here's more of a traditional show

1167
00:53:46,969 --> 00:53:50,049
[Music]

1168
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:06,608
[Laughter]

1169
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:09,159
that's not a one-hitter is it no

1170
00:54:06,608 --> 00:54:11,498
something you share people are the same

1171
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:14,140
so that's actually happening between the

1172
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:16,088
quasar and like a one-hitter yeah

1173
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:23,228
quasars like where's the point for 20

1174
00:54:16,088 --> 00:54:26,798
people next two years so we still have

1175
00:54:23,228 --> 00:54:28,629
services like the quasar even though you

1176
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:31,059
could pack the hell out of this and pass

1177
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:32,019
around a billion people I mean you could

1178
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,539
just keep it for yourself

1179
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:36,788
hash holds it very well it doesn't have

1180
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:38,949
to be fully sealed off so you can hit

1181
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:41,469
this the cherry goes out or you can

1182
00:54:38,949 --> 00:54:45,039
snuff the charity with some glass or or

1183
00:54:41,469 --> 00:54:46,599
a dish and then leave it on your desk or

1184
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,789
whatever and get back to it later what

1185
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:54,278
about a patient ways are like we had

1186
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:55,509
this last time we were usual and granted

1187
00:54:54,278 --> 00:54:58,108
part of that had to do with the fact

1188
00:54:55,509 --> 00:55:02,318
that we just we work we didn't have the

1189
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:03,998
proper fire to like the the coal well so

1190
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:07,358
we weren't we weren't starting this with

1191
00:55:03,998 --> 00:55:08,978
a proper coal but nonetheless whether

1192
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:10,449
you were or weren't and this was

1193
00:55:08,978 --> 00:55:12,879
something left over from when you're

1194
00:55:10,449 --> 00:55:15,219
smoking on a hookah you could come back

1195
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:18,749
to it later again hash holds up very

1196
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:22,539
well so is this just like a MOT like a

1197
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:25,418
electronic hookah necessary this is luxe

1198
00:55:22,539 --> 00:55:27,909
electronic yeah so thank you what's a

1199
00:55:25,418 --> 00:55:30,998
coal in there Oh coal its coal powered

1200
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:32,858
yeah okay so it is it is operates just

1201
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:35,259
like a traditional hookah does it's just

1202
00:55:32,858 --> 00:55:37,748
the only differences is their mechanism

1203
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:39,789
for it just but it's efficient it Joe

1204
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:40,629
it's yeah I haven't tried the quasar

1205
00:55:39,789 --> 00:55:42,760
tobacco yeah

1206
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:44,860
I'm sure works just fine with tobacco we

1207
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:48,370
were trying it which is with hash but

1208
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:50,789
hashes combustion rate is higher than in

1209
00:55:48,369 --> 00:55:57,130
tobacco it's just made for ash this is

1210
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:59,619
this device is not being rash oh no I

1211
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:07,750
saw people using tobacco really yeah

1212
00:55:59,619 --> 00:56:09,880
yeah yeah no no you're just but other

1213
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:11,579
way around I mean using hash at the back

1214
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:15,430
really is a very middle east thing so

1215
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:18,009
yeah yeah one or the other right so we

1216
00:56:15,429 --> 00:56:20,529
can also pack some like strawberry

1217
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:22,630
tobacco and dribble some of the hash ons

1218
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:23,740
yeah so if you were if you were to mix

1219
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:25,510
this with tobacco

1220
00:56:23,739 --> 00:56:27,729
it's wouldn't be as important to get a

1221
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:29,500
really hot coal as it would be if you're

1222
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:30,909
just smoking the hash by itself like if

1223
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,820
you're smoking have one you have to use

1224
00:56:30,909 --> 00:56:36,699
a lot less ash that's it that is 100%

1225
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:39,820
correct yeah so how many people still

1226
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:44,079
like to use hookahs are they still

1227
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:46,210
popular yeah yeah tons of people it's

1228
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:49,420
much more of a younger demographic yeah

1229
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:51,730
in terms of like so if they're older

1230
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:53,800
yeah when you're talking about papers

1231
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,949
anymore like in their 30s and older I

1232
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,870
think it's gonna be more of a foreign

1233
00:56:56,949 --> 00:57:02,079
foreigner type of thing right and people

1234
00:56:58,869 --> 00:57:05,529
who have friends are better of from

1235
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:08,049
foreign cultures right but when it comes

1236
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:10,510
to the two younger demographics very

1237
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:12,160
popular across the board a lot of it I

1238
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,720
think has to do with you know you're

1239
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:16,449
giving younger people another place to

1240
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:18,009
go right some kid just turns 18 he wants

1241
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:19,539
he or she wants all the places in the

1242
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,620
world to go to that's only for eighteen

1243
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:24,159
because they want to experience these

1244
00:57:20,619 --> 00:57:26,679
new things and so it's it's very much in

1245
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:28,359
line with that yeah wait sorry I tuned

1246
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:30,769
up night tuning back then you're saying

1247
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:34,730
there are places where an 18 year old

1248
00:57:30,769 --> 00:57:36,949
no hookah okay yeah Oh got it got it

1249
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:38,679
good there is and I won't name the

1250
00:57:36,949 --> 00:57:40,879
hookah place I'm not gonna burn about

1251
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:42,469
granted I haven't been there in a few

1252
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,720
years but I used to be friends with the

1253
00:57:42,469 --> 00:57:46,848
owner and I used to give him hash and he

1254
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:49,699
would keep some for himself and then mix

1255
00:57:46,849 --> 00:57:50,930
my tobacco for me yeah and you know get

1256
00:57:49,699 --> 00:58:06,769
everyone in the hook a place like

1257
00:57:50,929 --> 00:58:08,838
prairie dog and like so sorry so is this

1258
00:58:06,769 --> 00:58:11,088
how you like when you normally smoke

1259
00:58:08,838 --> 00:58:12,920
hash that's how I do it all this is how

1260
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:14,989
you number one yeah yeah this is number

1261
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:18,170
one yeah and then like what's sick I

1262
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:22,848
mean I'm a California kid and so we love

1263
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:24,889
our bombs yeah right yeah no I know I

1264
00:58:22,849 --> 00:58:27,109
mean Ella Delphis and East Coast last

1265
00:58:24,889 --> 00:58:30,799
company but I'm just saying just it's

1266
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:34,039
very very common for people to own a

1267
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:36,349
bomb out here very very common and if

1268
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:38,389
I'm not using a bomb then I'll be using

1269
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:40,160
add a brick and I'll be smoking rosin or

1270
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:43,460
something like that okay so that's

1271
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:46,879
number two depending on again wait yeah

1272
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:49,510
but across a month you do it with mostly

1273
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:55,160
of us mostly blowing hi baby

1274
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:58,520
ii and i really has a joke like whit

1275
00:58:55,159 --> 00:59:03,799
flower yeah and why do i smoke a lot

1276
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:06,588
flan that and rash and Rosen's I just I

1277
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:08,300
like my variety yeah and like even

1278
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:10,549
though I smoke a bong every day I smoke

1279
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:14,450
a dab every day more than one or two of

1280
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:18,140
them and I mean I roll at least one or

1281
00:59:14,449 --> 00:59:22,608
two joints a day so what's your nightcap

1282
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:25,549
my nightcap yeah long what the bomb the

1283
00:59:22,608 --> 00:59:27,440
bomb because it's will our or flower and

1284
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:30,380
hash both yeah Lauren house together

1285
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:35,000
yeah and then what do you start the day

1286
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:37,730
with so you just started standard is you

1287
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,519
know it's the easiest and it's the most

1288
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:42,440
efficient because with a barn when

1289
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:44,239
compared to when you're rolling joints

1290
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:48,829
you're consuming a lot less you're

1291
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:51,259
getting the job done with less so like

1292
00:59:48,829 --> 00:59:54,410
if you compare to high you get from a

1293
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:56,390
bong versus a joint you could probably

1294
00:59:54,409 --> 00:59:59,088
accomplish something similar to a joint

1295
00:59:56,389 --> 01:00:00,558
with like what five or six snaps and if

1296
00:59:59,088 --> 01:00:02,420
you were to compare how much product

1297
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,730
you're actually consuming in that five

1298
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:06,409
or six s versus what you're putting into

1299
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:08,480
that joint yeah

1300
01:00:06,409 --> 01:00:11,149
traditionally we would say it's not a

1301
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,280
joints were for growers and dealers yeah

1302
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:15,170
because it really is so inefficient you

1303
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,690
really have to be able to burn half of

1304
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:19,519
all of your product indiscriminately to

1305
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:22,068
do joints every out yeah the more you

1306
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:24,769
think about it you really do yeah yeah

1307
01:00:22,068 --> 01:00:26,389
and I know some joint in blunt smokers

1308
01:00:24,769 --> 01:00:28,159
where they don't even smoke the whole

1309
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:30,170
thing they're so nice give me two I've

1310
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:33,019
gotten to that yeah throw away happened

1311
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:34,519
but it's like as much as I I prefer the

1312
01:00:33,019 --> 01:00:39,409
flavor all in the first half

1313
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:41,179
I'll smoke the whole thing yeah yeah and

1314
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:44,629
work so I won't waste because you lived

1315
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:50,929
through the depression no no but I kind

1316
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:54,680
of used pre-roll or joint gets better

1317
01:00:50,929 --> 01:00:56,598
it totally improves it's like I love the

1318
01:00:54,679 --> 01:00:58,578
resins Greg's my wife and you can make

1319
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:00,289
these and they used to sell them I

1320
01:00:58,579 --> 01:01:03,589
forget what they called them she doesn't

1321
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:07,970
make them anymore she's she's pregnant

1322
01:01:03,588 --> 01:01:10,009
with twins but hers were killer and I

1323
01:01:07,969 --> 01:01:12,038
used to buy them from them they thought

1324
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:14,480
they sold them for like 30 bucks and

1325
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:17,599
they were last two or three days and and

1326
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:20,690
I put it out but as it burned out it it

1327
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:23,028
totally and by the end it was like and I

1328
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:25,460
was a hers world more well I've told her

1329
01:01:23,028 --> 01:01:28,130
I'm going this is what I'm talking about

1330
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:30,650
like if you know like and and to fund

1331
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:33,349
and hers were like they were famous for

1332
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:35,480
burning evenly down and then everything

1333
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:37,609
got better as it got down I'm like this

1334
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,230
thing is a work of art I'm telling you

1335
01:01:37,608 --> 01:01:41,480
and she made each one of them my hand

1336
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:42,769
well that's what I'm talking about great

1337
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,909
yeah I think there's a lot of space

1338
01:01:42,769 --> 01:01:46,219
companies

1339
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:47,808
yeah and it's a real specialized thing

1340
01:01:46,219 --> 01:01:49,909
and it's like a seasonal thing you go

1341
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:52,970
here's the flower the message here's the

1342
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:55,879
thing you're gonna only you know and but

1343
01:01:52,969 --> 01:01:58,068
next year we'll do some lemon teaming up

1344
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:00,019
with really specific arrange the market

1345
01:01:58,068 --> 01:02:01,338
and what you can go direct to people

1346
01:02:00,018 --> 01:02:02,239
you'll be delivering those to people

1347
01:02:01,338 --> 01:02:07,099
around the world

1348
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:08,568
Oh see all you true story yeah yeah

1352
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:16,278
way I here's what happened oh you'll

1353
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:19,539
appreciate I'm sorry

1354
01:02:16,278 --> 01:02:22,699
few things last year so I went up with

1355
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:26,420
with my buddy Brett and to the Emerald

1356
01:02:22,699 --> 01:02:30,409
cop and it was a Brett reasoner I don't

1357
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:33,980
know if you know her family from mmm I

1358
01:02:30,409 --> 01:02:36,739
don't think so there he's actually from

1359
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:38,358
the valley and and and he was like a kid

1360
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:40,219
in a candy shop and you know the Emerald

1361
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:42,949
cup was where you would you know

1362
01:02:40,219 --> 01:02:44,568
originally and there's still a bit valid

1363
01:02:42,949 --> 01:02:47,750
it's where the farmers would brought

1364
01:02:44,568 --> 01:02:50,449
bring their roses down so your house

1365
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:53,119
where else would you be in one place and

1366
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:54,439
and you know I saw and and and he got a

1367
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,568
whole bunch it had it all out on the

1368
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,639
table and I'm like this and he's like

1369
01:02:56,568 --> 01:03:00,108
jotting everything down and writing down

1370
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:03,078
and basically what he was doing with

1371
01:03:00,108 --> 01:03:05,750
curating that season's harvest whatever

1372
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:09,048
he had gotten the business model in

1373
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:10,789
there is like totally valid if you get

1374
01:03:09,048 --> 01:03:13,038
to know someone on the other side of the

1375
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:15,049
world who cannot come and experience

1376
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:18,009
that harvest and you learn about the

1377
01:03:15,048 --> 01:03:20,869
name you curio right before them say

1378
01:03:18,009 --> 01:03:24,798
10/10 don't give with all your ideas Tom

1379
01:03:20,869 --> 01:03:29,000
well I do I give my ideas or ideas or

1380
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:30,588
ideas because other ideas but even if

1381
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,150
you did that and you were arguing right

1382
01:03:30,588 --> 01:03:39,619
with them half the time only being a

1383
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:42,470
writer ideas if you leave ideas beget

1384
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:43,630
ideas so just leave your portal oh my

1385
01:03:42,469 --> 01:03:46,569
partner

1386
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:49,269
George something that does develop tons

1387
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:51,910
of ideas yeah it's like a tsunami or a

1388
01:03:49,269 --> 01:03:54,099
snowball it just it just keeps well I

1389
01:03:51,909 --> 01:03:55,480
mean if it's a tsunami in a snowboard

1390
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:57,039
and you have to smoke some more hash

1391
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,139
because you're just you know you don't

1392
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:01,659
want to like you know so you know and

1393
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:07,119
and and that is I mean I'm not you have

1394
01:04:01,659 --> 01:04:10,139
ideas beget ideas and yeah so what is

1395
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:14,380
that that's just Rajaram reusing yeah

1396
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:21,159
it's holding holding my my cannabis and

1397
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:24,970
so what flour do you like mostly indicas

1398
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:29,289
and indica dominant hybrids what I do

1399
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:32,679
smoke in a sativa typically stuff that's

1400
01:04:29,289 --> 01:04:35,529
more real dominant sativa I prefer in

1401
01:04:32,679 --> 01:04:37,329
concentrated form over flower form and

1402
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:37,780
if I do sum up the straight sativa in

1403
01:04:37,329 --> 01:04:40,150
the flower

1404
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:44,590
I actually prefer to mix it with a with

1405
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:47,889
it with a indica like I really enjoy the

1406
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:50,740
mixture of Jack Herer and OG Kush I

1407
01:04:47,889 --> 01:04:52,119
think those mixed together definitely

1408
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:54,429
complement complement each other because

1409
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:57,219
you you get that nice mixture of that

1410
01:04:54,429 --> 01:05:00,099
citrusy with that earthy tone and it's

1411
01:04:57,219 --> 01:05:01,659
just really really nice are you doing

1412
01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:03,099
both does this flower or when it's

1413
01:05:01,659 --> 01:05:05,619
flowering what's that

1414
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:06,549
I suppose this flower is like yeah yeah

1415
01:05:05,619 --> 01:05:11,039
yeah yeah

1416
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:11,039
well excellent mix I always talk into

1417
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:22,179
wait louder oh my god behind are like

1418
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:24,429
him and he was talking about mixing like

1419
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:27,129
four or five different cultivars to

1420
01:05:24,429 --> 01:05:29,710
create like his hash where his tinctures

1421
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:32,470
I thought was kind of cool because he

1422
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:35,079
wants to give somebody a broad and deep

1423
01:05:32,469 --> 01:05:41,189
of the spectrum sounded like one

1424
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:44,199
cultivar doesn't have everything or like

1425
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:46,889
noticeable amounts of everything where

1426
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:46,889
you mix a bunch

1427
01:05:54,670 --> 01:06:02,079
yeah I definitely prefer it out of all

1428
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:08,359
all right so you said you'd like to mix

1429
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:09,829
Jack and yeah when I was younger I was

1430
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:12,980
actually really into mixing flour

1431
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:16,009
strains together to just just makes up

1432
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:19,219
the terpene profile and flavors over but

1433
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:22,190
the only thing that I a stewardess Oh

1434
01:06:19,219 --> 01:06:23,959
everything it was kind of like you know

1435
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:25,820
how when you stick a small a little a

1436
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,358
small child in front of like a dirty

1437
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,769
machine

1438
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:30,849
yeah and they go and they get one of

1439
01:06:27,769 --> 01:06:34,009
everything yeah like that but what we

1440
01:06:30,849 --> 01:06:36,650
you know but the only thing that I've

1441
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:39,130
I've desired to mix over the years in

1442
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:42,650
terms of flour like the recent years are

1443
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:45,890
our sativa weapon in the coast just

1444
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:47,869
because it's just it's not that I won't

1445
01:06:45,889 --> 01:06:50,329
I can't enjoy it a sativa straight

1446
01:06:47,869 --> 01:06:51,890
flowers if I don't prefer it you know

1447
01:06:50,329 --> 01:06:54,199
I'm gonna smoke the Teva straight I

1448
01:06:51,889 --> 01:07:02,900
prefer to concentrate and then otherwise

1449
01:06:54,199 --> 01:07:07,389
I pour it into the highway are there

1450
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:14,960
particular brands of growers that you

1451
01:07:07,389 --> 01:07:17,929
like yeah I got a friend of mine he'll

1452
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,889
be having his stuff coming out pretty

1453
01:07:17,929 --> 01:07:21,829
soon

1454
01:07:18,889 --> 01:07:23,900
he owns America farms he's always

1455
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:30,199
produce good products where is he Dave

1456
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:33,639
LA yeah but he he'll have he'll have

1457
01:07:30,199 --> 01:07:36,909
some flour on on the 64 market

1458
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:36,909
he's still

1459
01:07:40,278 --> 01:07:45,559
and then this jar I'm reusing is

1460
01:07:43,429 --> 01:07:47,659
actually with another one named King's

1461
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:52,759
garden I talking to you about the last

1462
01:07:47,659 --> 01:07:54,439
time I did that so

1463
01:07:52,759 --> 01:07:58,338
Haseena grapes is the cut that I was

1464
01:07:54,438 --> 01:08:00,528
talking about but from and unless I'm

1465
01:07:58,338 --> 01:08:02,418
wrong on this but from what I understand

1466
01:08:00,528 --> 01:08:04,789
because I don't really know these guys

1467
01:08:02,418 --> 01:08:07,808
personally is the Hasidic grapes is from

1468
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:12,829
another breeder and that King's garden

1469
01:08:07,809 --> 01:08:14,449
got from this breeders so otherwise of

1470
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:17,389
all intensive purposes I think it's

1471
01:08:14,449 --> 01:08:20,210
their exclusive but it's definitely

1472
01:08:17,389 --> 01:08:22,639
unique cut I just like their product

1473
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:26,420
they make a quality flower and hold

1474
01:08:22,639 --> 01:08:28,250
yourself and and that's just about it

1475
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:30,969
it's polity and it's not overly

1476
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:34,750
expensive you know you can get a quarter

1477
01:08:30,969 --> 01:08:38,480
like a friend of a friend's company

1478
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:41,960
flower company yeah they sell King's

1479
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:43,968
garden and I think I think they're they

1480
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,980
sell if you like 50 or 60 bucks for a

1481
01:08:43,969 --> 01:08:49,429
quarter which is very reasonable in

1482
01:08:45,979 --> 01:08:50,959
terms of the recreational market I mean

1483
01:08:49,429 --> 01:08:58,000
anyone that's been to a recreational

1484
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:58,000
store knows how expensive and that's

1485
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:02,750
that's before you even see the taxes

1486
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:05,058
once they see the taxes the first time

1487
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:07,368
like oh it's like you voted for it

1488
01:09:05,059 --> 01:09:13,819
I had ablation for sorry when you're

1489
01:09:07,368 --> 01:09:18,439
done by the way here's this twenty five

1490
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:19,969
to forty five percent tax were the only

1491
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:21,618
reason I say the range is so big is

1492
01:09:19,969 --> 01:09:23,960
because that doesn't include the taxes

1493
01:09:21,618 --> 01:09:25,788
people don't see before it even touches

1494
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:28,698
them like them every level I have to

1495
01:09:25,788 --> 01:09:30,889
deal with major taxes and then and so

1496
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:33,408
the consumer obviously the consumer is

1497
01:09:30,889 --> 01:09:35,900
dealing with major taxes themselves but

1498
01:09:33,408 --> 01:09:37,488
they're not even seeing how much isn't

1499
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:41,509
laying the price before it even touches

1500
01:09:37,488 --> 01:09:43,818
them yeah and that information is super

1501
01:09:41,509 --> 01:09:45,229
important yeah and really unfortunately

1502
01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:46,579
it falls back on the fact that most

1503
01:09:45,229 --> 01:09:48,259
people just don't really like to read

1504
01:09:46,578 --> 01:09:51,018
stuff and they just they go off of what

1505
01:09:48,259 --> 01:09:52,578
other people say yeah so you know but

1506
01:09:51,019 --> 01:09:53,599
here we are and we're gonna make the

1507
01:09:52,578 --> 01:09:56,389
industry better I'm going to move

1508
01:09:53,599 --> 01:09:58,909
forward and hopefully people will amend

1509
01:09:56,389 --> 01:10:07,909
64 a little bit more municipalities will

1510
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:12,069
get a little friendlier and it's the

1511
01:10:07,908 --> 01:10:12,069
state is a brutal bill the drug dealer

1512
01:10:16,538 --> 01:10:25,309
so do you like nausea for instance has a

1513
01:10:22,788 --> 01:10:29,149
relationship with sunshine Johnson who's

1514
01:10:25,309 --> 01:10:32,119
a a dry for more up in Humboldt than

1515
01:10:29,149 --> 01:10:33,828
they actually have a have a you know and

1516
01:10:32,118 --> 01:10:36,469
actually I'm a current with sunshine

1517
01:10:33,828 --> 01:10:38,988
yeah ain't operating in and and she

1518
01:10:36,469 --> 01:10:41,840
grows for them is that something of

1519
01:10:38,988 --> 01:10:43,908
interest to you like when I visited her

1520
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,529
farm wasn't she has a small farm she's

1521
01:10:43,908 --> 01:10:48,138
like honey she'd do an article on the

1522
01:10:45,529 --> 01:10:50,509
grower in the hash maker and I'm like

1523
01:10:48,139 --> 01:10:54,230
that's a great idea I could think of two

1524
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:57,139
or three actually three cup-like couples

1525
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:58,968
that have that relationship and it's a

1526
01:10:57,139 --> 01:11:01,250
really beautiful thing because they each

1527
01:10:58,969 --> 01:11:02,750
have their own expertise and they come

1528
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:05,599
together and out of that they make it

1529
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:11,029
totally unique third product Oh a

1530
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:12,920
million collaboration right exactly also

1531
01:11:11,029 --> 01:11:15,259
known as a collaboration yeah what are

1532
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:17,510
there any farms that you guys we

1533
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:19,429
exclusively work with yeah our suppliers

1534
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:21,380
are twofold we exclusively work with

1535
01:11:19,429 --> 01:11:24,319
project cannabis they have a downtown

1536
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:27,949
facility with 850 lights they produce

1537
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:31,268
all of genetic Mike genetic extra medics

1538
01:11:27,948 --> 01:11:33,948
and then we also partnered with a

1539
01:11:31,269 --> 01:11:37,369
company up north the garden that

1540
01:11:33,948 --> 01:11:40,069
produces in greenhouses but yeah we try

1541
01:11:37,368 --> 01:11:44,359
to limit our supply to one or two oh

1542
01:11:40,069 --> 01:11:46,549
yeah yeah yeah carry any growing in the

1543
01:11:44,359 --> 01:11:47,859
long run you know the Holy Grail for

1544
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:49,690
Callie hash

1545
01:11:47,859 --> 01:11:51,759
have a vertically integrated project

1546
01:11:49,689 --> 01:11:53,888
where we're actually controlling some of

1547
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,869
our biomass creation and we're going to

1548
01:11:53,889 --> 01:11:58,029
places like Afghanistan and getting the

1549
01:11:55,868 --> 01:11:59,948
actual strings that we want and then

1550
01:11:58,029 --> 01:12:02,559
producing things from a vertically we

1551
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:05,829
want really control nature now you're

1552
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,840
talking and even once we get deliveries

1553
01:12:05,829 --> 01:12:12,880
though we still want to have you know

1554
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:14,679
the and whatnot that that are that we've

1555
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,230
produced in California and in other

1556
01:12:14,679 --> 01:12:19,840
places but we definitely want to have a

1557
01:12:17,229 --> 01:12:22,000
line that's that's landrace people so

1558
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:24,460
where in California would you want to

1559
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:30,368
grow it's a mimic Afghanistan that's a

1560
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:31,989
good question Long Beach unfortunately

1561
01:12:30,368 --> 01:12:34,118
unless you're up north then the best

1562
01:12:31,988 --> 01:12:36,218
hash is still made in a lot of ways up

1563
01:12:34,118 --> 01:12:37,809
north in California you have to just

1564
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:39,399
have a very controlled environment so

1565
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:43,840
you have to have a controlled room where

1566
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:47,379
you can wherever you want it to come

1567
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:50,920
closest to talking give me those Afghani

1568
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:53,250
landraces probably Grass Valley against

1569
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:55,868
thousand feet north of sedimentary

1570
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:57,819
cleanse mine says it's not just a go

1571
01:12:55,868 --> 01:12:59,170
it's not just hating landraces though

1572
01:12:57,819 --> 01:13:01,559
it's other land but yeah you need I'll

1573
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:04,658
get you Mendoza I'm gonna saying yeah

1574
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:06,909
and what that said it would be easier to

1575
01:13:04,658 --> 01:13:25,229
control the indoor environment to have

1576
01:13:06,908 --> 01:13:31,539
those different you know or something I

1577
01:13:25,229 --> 01:13:33,879
wanted yeah yeah okay um one of the

1578
01:13:31,539 --> 01:13:36,279
things I've come to appreciate between

1579
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:38,109
the different methods of growing and

1580
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:41,349
what that does to our end product is

1581
01:13:38,109 --> 01:13:43,238
hash makers is that without door product

1582
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:45,639
in the full spectrum from the Sun or

1583
01:13:43,238 --> 01:13:47,468
married so when you're using the full

1584
01:13:45,639 --> 01:13:49,239
spectrum from the Sun you essentially

1585
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:52,389
you're trichomes they develop in a

1586
01:13:49,238 --> 01:13:54,189
different way you know unfortunately the

1587
01:13:52,389 --> 01:13:57,340
best hash is usually made from

1588
01:13:54,189 --> 01:14:00,460
greenhouse full spectrum solar power

1589
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:03,760
of grown flower I'm a big proponent of

1590
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:06,159
soil grown and in greenhouse grown I'm

1591
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:09,100
using full full Sun spectrum you know

1592
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:10,779
there's nothing better now can you get

1593
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:12,100
close to it indoors yes can you make

1594
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:13,809
amazing half of them to more tender

1595
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,880
material yes but we get from two sources

1596
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:18,570
one is an indoor source project cannabis

1597
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,319
and the second one is it's actually

1598
01:14:18,569 --> 01:14:23,019
Patrick's project

1599
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:25,779
Patrick his corner of Green Goddess and

1600
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:27,460
tied 99 and in Melrose he also has a

1601
01:14:25,779 --> 01:14:30,159
bunch of wheat brands including tiny

1602
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:31,869
trees and Shiloh so we get all of our

1603
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:33,639
bio a lot of our biomass from them from

1604
01:14:31,869 --> 01:14:36,519
tiny trees in Shiloh and project

1605
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:37,990
cannabis well yeah we're talking with

1606
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,370
Wonder Bread right now we'll see where

1607
01:14:37,989 --> 01:14:41,529
that leads you know we're always looking

1608
01:14:39,369 --> 01:14:43,449
for whoever's popular where is creating

1609
01:14:41,529 --> 01:14:45,539
the best flower to partner with and do

1610
01:14:43,449 --> 01:14:48,489
collabs

1611
01:14:45,539 --> 01:14:50,409
yeah we're definitely we're doing a

1612
01:14:48,489 --> 01:14:51,909
loaded collab right now at the same time

1613
01:14:50,409 --> 01:14:53,889
