1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,919
today we're going to expand on the

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,919
concept of cultural control that we

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,599
briefly covered in our first webinar on

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:08,960
the 10 cardinal parameters of plant

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:12,718
health and vitality

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,719
and take a deep dive on ipm and imm

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,559
cultural control is environmental

8
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,719
control and it's the foundation of any

9
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,399
comprehensive ipm plan to manage the

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,320
pests and microbes present in your

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,038
cultivation space

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,879
it is also the oldest ipm method but was

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,199
largely abandoned with the advent of

14
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,358
chemical pesticides

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,480
the bioecology of the indoor garden was

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,679
not well understood

17
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:38,640
creating inconsistent results chemical

18
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,238
pesticides offered a more reliable

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,679
and less knowledge and skill dependent

20
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,759
solution

21
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,079
but as consumers desires for clean

22
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,320
pesticide-free cannabis increase

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,320
and the toxicity of pesticides becomes

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,320
further scrutinized by regulators and a

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,359
scourge on the environment

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,878
there is renewed interest in cultural

27
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,878
control

28
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,640
only recently has the pathogen host

29
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,159
environment relationship been understood

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,600
well enough to harness the power of

31
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,198
cultural control

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,040
to boost secondary metabolite and

33
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,560
biomass production

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,479
it also serves as a potent risk

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,400
reduction technique to prevent pests and

36
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,159
pathogens and allows cultivators to

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
produce consistent clean cannabis

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,880
cycle after cycle without the use of

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,879
harmful chemicals

40
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
just a quick note from the legal

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,960
department due to the federal illegality

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,360
of cannabis and the variability in

43
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,158
by state laws we cannot make specific

44
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,759
product

45
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,439
recommendations for your ipm plan

46
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,040
i'll pass it over to jesse to kick us

47
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,158
off

48
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,920
right on thanks brian

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,439
appreciate it and thanks everyone for

50
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,280
tuning in on this topic

51
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,279
i'll be honest it's one of the main

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,920
reasons i'm so passionate about

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,280
cultivating cannabis when my mom was

54
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,680
diagnosed with cancer

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,399
it was about trying to find her the best

56
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,680
and strongest possible medicine we could

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,159
we went everywhere we hit every

58
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,479
dispensary every medical outlet

59
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,479
and we purchased products that had mold

60
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,840
and mildew we purchased products that

61
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,438
didn't burn right

62
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,600
purchase products that were clearly

63
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,919
sprayed with pesticides

64
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,598
i remember one one time i was smoking

65
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,199
with my mom in the backyard and she

66
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,560
turned to me and she said oh

67
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,878
this one's a sparkler snap crackle

68
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,759
pop the bud was doing things it

69
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:21,280
shouldn't have

70
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,799
indicating that it had been sprayed with

71
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,598
something heavy metals

72
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,680
sulfur something along those lines for

73
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,598
me i immediately realized

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,959
the importance of integrated pest

75
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,119
management

76
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,159
and it's a controversial topic there's

77
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,959
personal choices

78
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,560
business choices and legal parameters

79
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
but when i had my hydro shop

80
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,800
oakland garden supply we encouraged

81
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,680
people to bring in leaves and media in a

82
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,280
bag

83
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,040
we put things under the scope and we'd

84
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,719
look at them we learned a lot

85
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,239
and the two questions i got more than

86
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,359
anything else were

87
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,680
what is this and how do i kill it

88
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
and my answer was usually are you sure

89
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,239
you want to kill it

90
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,239
and what are we doing to prevent it

91
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,319
as a result we became amateur

92
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,920
entomologists

93
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:07,679
microbiologists and chemists all in a

94
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,719
trial by fire

95
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,439
people would come in and want a solution

96
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,120
directly given to them within 10 minutes

97
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,158
and then we would have to look them in

98
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,719
the eye the next day

99
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,039
and talk about how effective it was so

100
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,878
the idea behind this webinar

101
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:27,919
was really to present the

102
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:30,318
tools and share some of the experiences

103
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,439
that i think will further the discussion

104
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,479
on ipm

105
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,079
and imm for cannabis so what is

106
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,639
integrated pest management

107
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,920
it's about dealing with and living with

108
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,039
and managing pest

109
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,079
same with imm integrated microbe

110
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,280
management

111
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,360
treat them the same way and i think it

112
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,680
probably seems like an

113
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,239
oversimplification

114
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,959
but the truth is i've used this triangle

115
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,239
and this

116
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,438
book to develop hundreds of successful

117
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,158
ipm and imm

118
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,959
plans for gardens the triangle on the

119
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,560
left

120
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,959
illustrates the progression from

121
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,039
prevention to intervention

122
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,120
it starts with cultural control that's

123
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,120
the foundation of ipm

124
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,438
cultural control is about creating an

125
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,079
environment where plants thrive

126
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,839
and bag bugs don't and it's the only

127
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,478
non-invasive option

128
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,959
then we move to physical control which

129
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,279
is about

130
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,240
traps barriers and the physical removal

131
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,239
of pests

132
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,560
then on to biological control which is

133
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,478
about deploying beneficial insects and

134
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,918
good microbes to work on your behalf to

135
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,319
eradicate pests

136
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,599
and then finally to chemical control the

137
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,120
application of items

138
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,879
toxic to pests that don't kill the plant

139
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,160
the reason i love this book hemp

140
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,639
diseases and pests

141
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,960
management and biological control is

142
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,519
because it allows you to look up a pest

143
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:56,560
and understand the progression that you

144
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:58,159
need to take in order to eradicate it

145
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,839
but it's important to know the tools of

146
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,639
the trade

147
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,918
when we really think about fighting

148
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,120
pests and pathogens

149
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,120
it's important to start with good

150
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,959
genetics i mean i think this is one of

151
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,360
the reasons why so many people

152
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,159
grew blue dream initially it's a great

153
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,479
yielder

154
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,600
it's hard to kill even when it's covered

155
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,758
with mites

156
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,039
but that's really not enough we need to

157
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,919
understand that

158
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:24,079
growing healthy plants is a science and

159
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,599
these tools are going to help you refine

160
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,359
the process

161
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,919
it starts with some sort of lighting

162
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,080
meter something to determine the energy

163
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:35,279
that's coming into the space

164
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,240
lighting infrared uv they're all

165
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,758
important

166
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,680
then you need to think about the

167
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,879
temperature and humidity of the ambient

168
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,199
space

169
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,560
you need to think about some sort of

170
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,639
tool to measure

171
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,839
leaf temperature whether it's a camera

172
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
or an ir gun

173
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,159
so you can manage vpd your vapor

174
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,599
pressure deficit

175
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,720
then you should think about measuring

176
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,879
the gases in the space specifically co2

177
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,720
you'll need some sort of microscope to

178
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,800
take a close look at bugs

179
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,080
eggs and leaves sometimes you can even

180
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,720
get away with a camera

181
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,478
a microscope app then you need some sort

182
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
of water activity meter

183
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,399
to determine whether or not your product

184
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,800
is safe for final packaging

185
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,318
and lastly one tool that i like to use

186
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,079
is a refractometer

187
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,919
which essentially measures bricks in the

188
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,120
plant and this is a trick i learned from

189
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,519
commercial gardens

190
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,519
that grow grapes in northern california

191
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,879
which is if you can get your brix level

192
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,680
above 12

193
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,519
it's going to be really hard for bugs to

194
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,918
eat your plants

195
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,120
so the healthier plants we grow the less

196
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,399
susceptible they are

197
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,399
to pests and pathogens

198
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,840
but it's also about creating the right

199
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,800
culture in this case

200
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,719
creating a clean environment it's

201
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,240
important to clean the garden space in

202
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,479
between runs

203
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,360
something like hydrogen peroxide or

204
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,359
gases like

205
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,120
ozone that really get into the nooks and

206
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,720
crannies will help you eliminate the

207
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,560
pest vectors

208
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,919
it's also important to remember to do

209
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,319
this when the plants

210
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,079
aren't in the room because some of these

211
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,479
products can have a detrimental effect

212
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,758
on the secondary metabolites

213
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:12,879
also you need to clean filters fans

214
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,280
fertigation lines and those

215
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,279
wild condensate lines who knows what's

216
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,159
in there you need to clean them

217
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,519
clean the plant debris from the space

218
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,400
from defoliation

219
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,240
dispose of that properly and also i

220
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,399
think a lot of people know this but

221
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,319
quarantine your plants but also

222
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,719
quarantine your media

223
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,080
as it enters the facility i like to

224
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,080
treat every plant

225
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,719
and every media that comes into my

226
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:41,758
facility as if it were infected

227
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,199
and deal with it appropriately then

228
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,800
i think something that we've all gotten

229
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,598
a lot more used to recently

230
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,598
is that people carry pests we have ten

231
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,800
thousand microbes on each hand

232
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,639
and we shell forty thousand micro

233
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,439
or forty thousand skin cells every

234
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,120
single minute so sops are important

235
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,719
wear gloves wear hair nets also

236
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,478
think about cleaning the ancillary

237
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,560
spaces like the bathroom

238
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,000
employees use the bathroom they go in

239
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,720
they play with their phone

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,038
then they wash their hands but when they

241
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,199
leave the bathroom what's on their feet

242
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:17,360
what's on their pants are they bringing

243
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,000
pathogens into the space

244
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,639
think about the hallways the mop sink

245
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,399
these are all

246
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,918
vectors and they either need to be

247
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,279
cleaned with technology

248
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:29,519
or with elbow grease also

249
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,359
think about cleaning the water the water

250
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,879
that comes into the facility is usually

251
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,240
not the biggest obstacle it's the

252
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,479
recycled water

253
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,240
it's about standing water and making

254
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,200
sure that standing water is

255
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,080
treated appropriately aerated because if

256
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,080
it's not

257
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,519
it's going to develop water molds that

258
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,440
are systemic and you'll feed them

259
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,759
directly to your plants

260
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,480
so another way to remember it is start

261
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:55,838
clean

262
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:58,000
stay clean finish strong

263
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,240
so now that we have a culture of clean

264
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,159
let's talk about a culture of success

265
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
and that starts with scouting with a

266
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,838
microscope

267
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,959
getting positive identification taking

268
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,160
appropriate action

269
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:12,159
and evaluating it's a continuous cycle

270
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,278
keep a log of the pests keep a log of

271
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,958
the conditions

272
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,559
the fertigation the water into the space

273
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,000
all these things are important when you

274
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,879
think about

275
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,639
historical trends and how you're gonna

276
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,639
eradicate pests for the long haul

277
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,639
speaking more about positive

278
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,839
identification this is

279
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,838
so important to winning the war against

280
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,240
the pests to threaten you

281
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,839
there's an entomologist that i love her

282
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,440
work and i love what she has to say

283
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,040
suzanne wainwright evans

284
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,720
she's when she decides to publish

285
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,240
her photo book on positive

286
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,240
identification

287
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,000
i would spend whatever it costs to get

288
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,919
that book because

289
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,240
positive identification is critical like

290
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,079
i said to a lot of people looking at

291
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,519
this slide they might think man look at

292
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,920
all those bad bugs

293
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,440
but they're not all bad bugs sure the

294
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,559
majority of them are

295
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,399
but a cautious story i worked at a

296
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,559
facility in oakland that was an outdoor

297
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,399
facility and i came into work one day

298
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,838
and there was a petri dish filled with

299
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,078
larva and a note that said

300
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,680
jesse please kill these bugs as fast as

301
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,958
possible

302
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,199
and i sighed i picked up the petri dish

303
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,679
i

304
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,519
opened it up i walked outside and i

305
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,838
sprinkled the ladybug larva

306
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,959
all over the plants it was a

307
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,680
inappropriate identification of a pest

308
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,879
so it's critical that you know good bugs

309
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,278
and bad bugs

310
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,639
otherwise you'll be trying to kill all

311
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,200
the guys that are trying to help you

312
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,199
fight the war

313
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,240
positive identification of microbes is

314
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,639
also important this is a chance to bring

315
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,159
in a microbiologist to talk about

316
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,399
which microbes are good and which

317
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,399
microbes are bad which microbes you have

318
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,519
in your compost tea which microbes you

319
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,360
have in your space

320
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,200
they can take samples and they can give

321
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,399
you a really good idea of what you're

322
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
working with

323
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,480
but furthermore get to know your shapes

324
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,000
and structures

325
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,920
once you start to know this you can

326
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,159
really do an amateur

327
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,838
evaluation and identification under a

328
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,559
microscope

329
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,640
another story of caution here when it

330
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,479
comes to positive identification is i

331
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,360
had a friend who had a 500 light

332
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,920
facility

333
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,919
and he said hey jesse one of my rooms we

334
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,159
had catastrophic loss in week four

335
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,759
everything just died because of rude

336
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,600
aphids please come

337
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,879
assess the situation and tell me how to

338
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,720
kill the rude aphids

339
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,200
i went to the facility i looked through

340
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,200
the media i dug through the root zone

341
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,120
i looked at every plant i possibly could

342
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,680
i couldn't find larvae i couldn't find

343
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,600
eggs

344
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,278
maybe i found some fungus gnats but i

345
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,839
sure didn't find root aphids

346
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,919
and then it hit me you have pythium i

347
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,680
could see it on the stalks of the plant

348
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,759
so i said let's go look at your water

349
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,159
source so we immediately went to his

350
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,120
water source which is a 250 gallon tank

351
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,120
outside of the room

352
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,278
that wasn't aerated wasn't treated with

353
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,078
uv wasn't treated with anything

354
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,919
and i could see the black mold growing

355
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,838
on top of the water surface

356
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,599
and what i said was all right you're

357
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,320
feeding your plants pythium and they're

358
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,079
gonna die

359
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,680
you're feeding them a systemic water

360
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,239
mold that's going to kill them

361
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,120
that's the problem not root aphids so

362
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,959
all the effort

363
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,720
all the time and all the money you spent

364
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,439
trying to kill root aphids that weren't

365
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,000
there

366
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,200
were just simply not effective positive

367
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,839
identification

368
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,839
is critical

369
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,959
so when it comes to positive id let's

370
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,519
assume for a second that we've made one

371
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,559
we have mites and we have powdery mildew

372
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,480
but witch mites

373
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,399
are they carmine mites are they russet

374
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,320
mites are they broad mites

375
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,600
in this case we have a picture of two

376
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,040
spotted mites

377
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,600
and powdery mildew so now that we know

378
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,958
who our enemy is let's learn everything

379
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,519
we can about them

380
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,958
do every bit of research you can consult

381
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,360
the hemp disease book

382
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,559
look at everything you can possibly read

383
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,639
to understand

384
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,479
how these things grow and live so a

385
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,320
little bit on powdery mildew we know

386
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,560
that it thrives in low light conditions

387
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,000
with poor air circulation and excess

388
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,078
nitrogen we know it's spread

389
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,240
by the air and we know that it's spread

390
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:14,559
faster in high humidity environments

391
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:17,919
and we also know that it's all around us

392
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,759
spider mites right we know they feed on

393
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,759
these particular two spotted spider

394
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,639
mites feed on chlorophyll-rich plants

395
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,360
the females lay 200 eggs every eight

396
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,159
days

397
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,079
they prefer hot and dry conditions cold

398
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,600
temperatures cause hibernation

399
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,159
and the light cycle is going to impact

400
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,519
their action so this gives us the things

401
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,679
that we need to know

402
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,639
what are the pests susceptible to how do

403
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,039
they feed

404
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,079
how do they breed how do they move where

405
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,679
they hide

406
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:45,679
and how do we pierce their armor

407
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,799
well the first step is understanding how

408
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,000
we prevent this infestation in the first

409
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,078
place

410
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,198
so we need to understand cultural

411
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,198
control again

412
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,159
for any pest it's about creating an

413
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:03,759
environment where they can't thrive

414
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:06,958
so how do we do that well

415
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,639
at inspire we model every room so we

416
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,239
know where the air flows so we can

417
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,399
create the right pressures

418
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,079
we remove oscillating fans and pocket

419
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,000
dehumidifiers so they don't create

420
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:19,359
microclimates or become the source of

421
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,519
pests then it's about air cycling

422
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,879
every three minutes we try to cycle

423
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,440
through multi-stage

424
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,559
filtration first through a merv 13

425
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,480
capture filter

426
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,958
which gets everything down to about one

427
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,560
micron then through a photocatalytic

428
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,039
oxidation process

429
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,679
which is essentially uv light shining on

430
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,399
titanium dioxide which creates hydroxyl

431
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,278
radicals

432
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,759
that function like a molecular shredder

433
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:43,600
then

434
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,559
in-rack airflow will continue the

435
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,839
airflow cycle by delivering the co2 rich

436
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,399
conditioned air

437
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,320
without radical oxidative species

438
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,320
directly to the plant stomata

439
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,240
to break up the canopy which further

440
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,600
eliminates microclimates

441
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,480
and lastly it's about control control of

442
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,720
the temperature

443
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,759
control of the humidity when the lights

444
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,000
are on

445
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,838
when the lights are off and during the

446
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,440
transitions

447
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,279
swings in temperature and humidity

448
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,880
create an environment for powdery mildew

449
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,278
to take hold

450
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,559
and precision control will allow you to

451
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,720
manage your vpd

452
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,159
your vapor pressure deficit at every

453
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,240
stage of the plant growth

454
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,000
which will help mitigate the risk of

455
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,440
powdery mildew

456
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,120
it's also important to note

457
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,440
understanding light penetration

458
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,320
temperature humidity air flow nutrient

459
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,320
dilution

460
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,920
watering rate they all play a big role

461
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,959
in the formation and spread of powdering

462
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,240
mildew

463
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,239
so get control of your culture

464
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,600
and powdering mildew won't affect the

465
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,440
bottom line

466
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,720
don't get control and you'll need to

467
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,320
prepare for a war

468
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,320
every single flower run

469
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,240
so what's the next type of control it's

470
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,639
physical control

471
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,919
what could we have done physically to

472
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,399
prevent the spread of this

473
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,919
well first let's check the air pressures

474
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,958
and make sure that we have a positively

475
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,120
pressured space

476
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,719
let's check the sops and make sure that

477
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,000
everyone is wearing gloves when they

478
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,000
handle the plants

479
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,600
we want to make sure that your master

480
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,519
gardener isn't playing with their

481
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,959
pitbull before they come into the shop

482
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,799
and we want to make sure that house

483
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,719
flies aren't entering either

484
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,879
who knows where your pit bull was last

485
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,040
night and spider mites can

486
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,480
hit your ride on the back of house flies

487
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,838
and get into your facility

488
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,920
so it's not the flies that are the

489
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,199
problem but they are the vector

490
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,679
so what's the solution amputate

491
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,639
and remove leaves at the initiation of

492
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,638
outbreak

493
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,480
we had mentioned two spotted spider

494
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,000
mites lay 200 eggs

495
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,000
every 8 days so by removing those leaves

496
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,799
we can remove a significant amount of

497
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,198
eggs sometimes a lot more than 200

498
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,519
but again be careful because if we

499
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:55,039
remove too many leaves that's going to

500
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,039
affect the plant's vitality

501
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,240
the next stage of control is biological

502
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,278
control which really deals with the

503
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,199
three p's

504
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:06,959
predators parasites and pathogens

505
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,558
this is another opportunity to bring an

506
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,798
entomologist to the party

507
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,838
but the resources are out there it makes

508
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,000
me think of my friend

509
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,599
charlie mckenzie and the cropwalk team

510
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,078
who does an ipm audit

511
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,399
they'll walk your facility tell you what

512
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,720
bio biologicals would help you

513
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,880
win the war and in this case we have two

514
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,078
spotted spider mites so we might choose

515
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,240
californicus

516
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,678
and persimilis they both work a little

517
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,160
bit differently they're a little bit

518
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,919
different

519
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,679
different sizes but they're both going

520
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,840
to eat mites and eggs

521
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,519
and it's important to know because if we

522
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,439
think we're going to bring

523
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,558
rove beetles in here then they're going

524
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,240
to live in the media

525
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:47,119
and not on the leaf tissue and not be

526
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,599
quite as effective for what we need

527
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,439
and then we can think about biological

528
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,558
control with microbes

529
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,320
it's a chance for you to bring a

530
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,119
microbiologist to the party to talk

531
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,558
about

532
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,479
which microbes are going to thrive in

533
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,160
our space how we're going to get these

534
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,480
microbes is it teas

535
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,160
is it ferments is it purchasing

536
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,599
individual microbes

537
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,519
and if you take a close look at this

538
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,599
slide you can see

539
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,400
we might choose bacillus pamilis which

540
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:15,199
is a fungicide bacillus subtilis which

541
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,280
eats powdery mildew streptomyces

542
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,840
trichoderma there's a lot of choices

543
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,519
here

544
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,199
that we can apply apply from a

545
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,960
biological standpoint

546
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,319
to eradicate the threats of powdery

547
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,200
mildew there are also

548
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,000
beneficial bacteria that consume eggs

549
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,279
and

550
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,440
ward off bugs so it's it's a real option

551
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:37,200
for you but it takes an understanding

552
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,200
of microbiology to deploy

553
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,639
then the next step is chemical control

554
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,240
so

555
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,679
this is the chance for you to bring

556
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,000
another is to the party

557
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,000
a chemist and this chemist is going to

558
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,839
tell us what's in every bottle

559
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,319
and how it works and how it affects the

560
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:57,918
plant

561
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,079
there's a lot of tough decisions to make

562
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,400
here are we going to go with

563
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,199
biorational insecticides are we going to

564
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,400
go with

565
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,480
synthetic insecticides there

566
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,880
essentially are two main camps when you

567
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,759
really break it down the long-term

568
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,400
prevention and eradication of pests fall

569
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,640
into

570
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,759
the oils and soaps category or the

571
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,120
sulfur category

572
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,798
and one of the major reasons we

573
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,359
differentiate the two

574
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,160
is because we can't apply them both at

575
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,479
the same time

576
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,679
it's not a matter of just going into the

577
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,919
ipm cupboard

578
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,000
grabbing a bottle and applying it we

579
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,280
need to know how these things work

580
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,400
as a synergy if we apply oils then we

581
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,279
really can't apply

582
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,679
sulfur within the next 14 days or we'll

583
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,599
burn

584
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,320
our plants so it's an important

585
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:47,678
consideration the chemistry the makeup

586
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,678
and how they impact the plant

587
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,839
alright so which path do we choose

588
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,599
this is where it becomes a personal and

589
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,959
business decision and it gets really

590
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,038
tricky

591
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,720
this is really about understanding the

592
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,640
interaction between

593
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,880
technology the farmer the market

594
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,799
and enforcement there are a lot of

595
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,640
things at play when determining the

596
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,558
appropriate ipm strategy for your

597
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,640
cultivation facility

598
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,119
it's a delicate balance of risk and

599
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,840
reward but it's also a personal choice

600
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,839
that will affect the business bottom

601
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,839
line

602
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,960
so legality and this is something that

603
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:30,558
brian mentioned earlier

604
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,159
federally illegal it becomes a gray area

605
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,319
when deciding which

606
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,280
which pesticides and which biological

607
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,599
control methodologies to deploy

608
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,399
federally there are no guidelines state

609
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,158
by state

610
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,159
there are varying guidelines so it's

611
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,039
important to know in your state

612
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,559
what you can and can't use and that's

613
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,919
important because

614
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:54,000
testing is the enforcement arm

615
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,200
so we need to know what's going to show

616
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,359
up on a test

617
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,038
how it's going to show up and what's the

618
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:02,000
cost of that

619
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,158
so if you use a substance you shouldn't

620
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,519
or you use a substance that's allowed

621
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,039
but you use it at the wrong

622
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:11,918
time it will show up as a fail

623
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:14,240
for residual pesticides and that will be

624
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,038
a compromise to the end product

625
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,519
and it will be a compromise to the brand

626
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:19,359
it's

627
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,158
often very hard to recover from

628
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,158
something like this

629
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,279
and next in making this decision it's

630
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,319
about understanding the factors of

631
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,639
influence

632
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,399
and i think a lot of times when we think

633
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,200
about factors of influence we think

634
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:40,320
about doing a cost benefit analysis

635
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:43,679
how does this system make sense for us

636
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:46,319
where is the risk where is the reward

637
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,240
what are the costs so it's about taking

638
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,000
the historic ipm triangle

639
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,960
and incorporating it into your business

640
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,200
plan for long-term success

641
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,000
understanding the modes of action how

642
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,440
things work

643
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,200
understanding the environmental

644
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,038
considerations how do they work in your

645
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,319
space and how do they affect the spaces

646
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:03,839
outside of yours what are the

647
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,519
application guidelines

648
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,759
what's the dilution rate how much does

649
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,319
it cost to use it what are the timelines

650
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,319
for

651
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,879
efficacy what are the timelines for your

652
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,319
needs what are the stages of development

653
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,159
that you're encountering with your

654
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,399
particular pest

655
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,240
what's the systemic acquired response

656
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,880
how are the plants going to respond to

657
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,359
this

658
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,640
can we prep them for a threat and what

659
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,558
are the synergies

660
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,759
how do these things work together and

661
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,918
i'll try and go through them really

662
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:33,200
quickly

663
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,559
so modes of action there are a lot of

664
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,159
different modes of action and there are

665
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,079
good resources out there that break them

666
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,159
down in even more detail

667
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,918
but essentially we're talking about how

668
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,520
are we going to physically kill the bugs

669
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,840
are we going to dehydrate them

670
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,599
are we going to suffocate them are we

671
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,519
going to get them to eat something

672
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,359
that kills them from the inside are we

673
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,918
going to affect their nervous system

674
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,199
by either over activating them or

675
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,600
slowing their development

676
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,279
are we going to prevent them from

677
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,678
molting are we going to prevent them

678
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,678
from developing into the next stage

679
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,159
and also i think there's a great picture

680
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,080
here in the lower right corner

681
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,840
that if you've read jeff lowenfeld's

682
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,079
book teaming with microbes or

683
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,158
studied with dr elaine ingham you'll

684
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:16,079
know that this is a fungal hyphy

685
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,440
that is strangling a root-feeding

686
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:23,839
nematode

687
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,840
pretty cool mode of action in my book

688
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,240
then you have the environmental

689
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,038
considerations just like i mentioned

690
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,599
all the ipm and imm decisions you make

691
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:33,359
will either

692
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,519
impact the environment or will be

693
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:37,599
impacted by the environment

694
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,839
your brand might be more well received

695
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,678
if you choose the least toxic path

696
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,678
but the application environment like

697
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,640
temperature humidity and airflow can

698
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,679
have a dramatic

699
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,480
impact on management efficacy if you're

700
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,000
playing the microbe and biological angle

701
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,839
think about creating environmental

702
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,839
conditions for them to thrive

703
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,439
beneficials need habitat they need a

704
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,119
food source they need appropriate

705
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,880
temperatures in day and night

706
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:02,959
so that they can breed and they can

707
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,480
establish for the long haul

708
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,000
also think about environmental

709
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,558
considerations for chemists

710
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,119
the chemistry you might use for example

711
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:10,960
sulfur

712
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:12,558
is going to be much more effective in a

713
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,079
high humidity environment

714
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:17,038
when the temperatures are below 80

715
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,359
degrees in a dry and hot environment

716
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,759
you apply sulfur you will burn the

717
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,759
plants

718
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,479
then you have to think about application

719
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,119
guidelines

720
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,440
how do i apply this product is it a dust

721
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,399
do i spray it on the leaves do i dose it

722
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,759
in line

723
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,080
where do i deploy the sachets of insects

724
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,158
what's the personal protective equipment

725
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,879
i need for this application

726
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,000
what's the dilution rate per acre per

727
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,559
canopy

728
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,919
per plant the math can get confusing

729
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,839
when do i apply it

730
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,600
where do i apply it in the root zone the

731
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,319
undersides of the leaves the tops of the

732
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,000
leaves

733
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,599
well for mites we know we need to focus

734
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,798
on the undersides of the leaves and for

735
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,839
pm it's going to be

736
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,839
all over the plant but important

737
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,839
considerations

738
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,759
timelines timelines are of utmost

739
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,200
importance as well

740
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:11,359
for reapplication for toxicity toxicity

741
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,038
to the bug toxicity to the plant

742
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,359
we need to understand the time that it

743
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,839
takes the fungal hyphae to develop so it

744
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,240
can strangle that root feeding nematode

745
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,759
we need to understand how long it takes

746
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,359
resistance to occur

747
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,879
in the bug we need to understand that so

748
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,278
we know when to rotate

749
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,919
the modes of action we need to

750
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,919
understand

751
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,038
how long it takes the plant to build up

752
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,880
defenses

753
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,319
so we're building up the defenses to the

754
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,799
utmost capability

755
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,519
before these threats come we need to

756
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,480
understand

757
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,000
how long it takes these applications to

758
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,759
be effective

759
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,519
how long does it take them to work how

760
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,158
long before we judge whether that

761
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,158
application was or wasn't effective

762
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,440
what's the half-life how long does it

763
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,200
work for

764
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,640
and what's the re-entry period for

765
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,080
worker safety

766
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,919
how long do we have to wait before we

767
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,399
can go back into the space and start

768
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,400
growing

769
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,720
another factor of influence is thinking

770
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,319
about the stages of development

771
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,480
first the stage of development of the

772
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,599
plant then the stage of development of

773
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,839
the pest

774
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,879
we want to kill all stages of the pest

775
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,278
development

776
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,320
while considering all stages of the

777
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,480
growth

778
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,158
so for something like our two spotted

779
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,159
mites we're going to want an

780
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:30,480
obicide a larvicide a pupicide

781
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,960
and an adulticide we want to kill them

782
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,880
at every stage

783
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,079
for the powdery mildew we want to think

784
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,360
about something that's going to deal

785
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,079
with the pustules

786
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,519
the spores and the fruiting bodies

787
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,199
important to consider

788
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,879
all of those factors and deploy

789
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,120
different mode of actions

790
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,400
varied at different timelines to be most

791
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,798
effective

792
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,759
something to think about sulfur is going

793
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,839
to kill powdery mildew and mites

794
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,879
really well but when you get into late

795
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,278
stage flour

796
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,679
if you spray your skittles with sulfur

797
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:03,519
they're gonna turn into rotten eggs

798
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,720
so it's important to understand the

799
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:06,960
stage of development

800
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,759
the application and its impact on the

801
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,759
final product

802
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,359
then we get to systemic acquired

803
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,879
response and this is essentially getting

804
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,839
the plant to fight back

805
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,120
for you it has natural defenses and with

806
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:24,240
hormones

807
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:27,278
acids enzymes and microbes we can

808
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,599
trigger the plant's natural responses

809
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,278
i love salicylic acid it's a product

810
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,439
that you can apply to your plant

811
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,278
to get it more tertiare to get it more

812
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,600
rigid to have the plant be

813
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:40,720
very strong and very hard to eat from a

814
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:44,079
leaf tissue and a root zone perspective

815
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,319
also i love to apply seaweed or kelp

816
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,759
and one of the main reasons for that

817
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,639
outside of the fact that i love to eat

818
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,038
seaweed

819
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,120
is it's filled with beneficial hormones

820
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,759
in a very balanced application

821
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:57,119
cytokinins auxins and jaberlins will all

822
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,000
help the plant

823
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,319
trigger its natural defense mechanism

824
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,278
and

825
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,879
fight off this plant so in reality or

826
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,558
fight off this pest in reality what

827
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,039
we're trying to do

828
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:13,440
is uh uh prepare the plant for war

829
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:17,839
at all times and allow the plant to

830
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,840
defend itself naturally

831
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,079
and then that brings us to synergies and

832
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,240
this is about

833
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,678
how the choices that you make interact

834
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,679
with each other

835
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,240
how do they inner fat interact with the

836
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,120
microbes the beneficials how do the

837
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,960
chemicals

838
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,359
kill beneficials how do they kill the

839
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,840
bad guy how do they affect the plant

840
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:40,000
and again synergies sulfurs and oils

841
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,398
right we can't spray them at the same

842
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,038
time

843
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,079
otherwise we will burn their plant how

844
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:45,599
do your choices

845
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,359
interact with your personal

846
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,558
consciousness and how do they

847
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:55,199
impact the bottom line efficacy

848
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:55,200
price point branding and the final

849
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:01,038
product

850
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,159
at the end of the day what i usually say

851
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,038
is your ipm

852
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,520
and imm strategy will have a tremendous

853
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:10,960
impact on how your plant grows

854
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:13,599
every ipm and imm choice you make has an

855
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,679
impact on the pest the plant and the

856
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,319
environment

857
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,080
the more that you can prevent the less

858
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,200
you'll have to intervene

859
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:25,918
and accept the negative impacts physical

860
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,600
biological and chemical control can have

861
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,759
on plant vitality

862
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,240
yield and quality of your finished

863
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,798
flowers and extracts

864
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,159
i like to say control your culture or it

865
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,480
will control you

866
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,360
and what i mean by that is that a lack

867
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,480
of control

868
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:46,479
will necessitate consistent intervention

869
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,759
and leads to inconsistent results

870
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,440
physical biological and chemical

871
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:54,798
control require training and

872
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:59,120
misapplications do happen

873
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:02,000
sometimes with disastrous results

874
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,639
whereas proper cultural control has no

875
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,079
negative

876
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,880
impacts on the plant it will never burn

877
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:12,319
your plant and it synergizes with every

878
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,559
aspect of your cultivation operation

879
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,359
cultural control is environmental

880
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,158
control

881
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,879
it's the foundation of any ipm and imm

882
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,200
strategy

883
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,640
and the key to consistent high quality

884
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,240
harvest

885
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,720
if you don't have good environmental

886
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,519
control you will always be battling

887
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,600
pests

888
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,038
and you will never know how many grams

889
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,359
per square foot

890
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,519
or hundreds of dollars per pound it is

891
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,278
costing you

892
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,119
and with that i'd love to sort of jump

893
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:40,720
into some q a i tried to go through that

894
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,319
pretty quick so we could tackle some

895
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,759
real world questions which

896
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,839
we saw a lot of come in before the

897
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:48,960
webinar as well uh

898
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,319
first question here from ben uh you

899
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,640
didn't answer how i kill

900
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:56,720
pm and mites uh

901
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,720
yeah that's a great question ben and i

902
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,720
appreciate that and it's something that

903
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,399
um i think definitely takes a

904
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,200
conversation with the individual

905
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:05,839
gardener

906
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,120
on making the appropriate approach but

907
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,038
let me put it this way

908
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,119
it starts with cultural control you need

909
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,640
to have a clean space

910
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,158
and then the progression goes something

911
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,080
like this right

912
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,278
we need to get cultural control so we

913
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,960
can prevent this from happening in the

914
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,880
future we need to get cultural control

915
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,759
so the applications that we take

916
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,799
are most effective for me i like to

917
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,720
start with

918
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,960
if there's an outbreak immediately go to

919
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,679
physical control remove the leaves

920
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,558
that you see being hot spots for

921
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,038
possible

922
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,798
vectors contamination and spread and

923
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,440
then it's about building this castle

924
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:41,759
cell wall with microbiology

925
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,600
i had mentioned a handful of beneficial

926
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,278
fungi and bacteria that work against

927
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,879
powder and mildew and may work against

928
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,960
mites in the space

929
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,480
but my feeling is it's all about

930
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,360
diversity let's throw

931
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,038
every beneficial microbe we can at this

932
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:56,959
plant and see how she responds

933
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,278
let's give her every tool in the toolbox

934
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,880
we don't know enough about microbiology

935
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,200
and plants for me to say

936
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,240
this is the answer instead i say think

937
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,798
about teas

938
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,640
ferments read some good books that are

939
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,639
challenging

940
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,559
challenging what we know and allowing us

941
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,600
to really dive into

942
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:17,678
different microbiological answers then

943
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,599
it comes to to an actual deployment of

944
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:23,278
beneficial insects right

945
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:25,439
so in this particular case like

946
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:26,720
let's bring insects to the party but

947
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,558
what if we're indoors

948
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,240
maybe that's not an option like i don't

949
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:31,599
want to burn a bunch of ladybugs and i

950
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,880
don't want to clean up a bunch of dead

951
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:35,439
carcasses so

952
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,440
same time i'm thinking give me diversity

953
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,880
give me as many beneficials as i can

954
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,919
let's get them in the root zone maybe

955
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,320
they're not a direct

956
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,519
impact on that spider mite but they're

957
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,879
going to help us

958
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,880
you know uh soil mites or rove beetles

959
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,399
beneficial nematodes get them all to the

960
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,640
party

961
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:54,798
so they can try and work for you 24

962
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,399
hours a day the entire time before we

963
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,798
have to get to chemical

964
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,439
and then when it comes to chemical i

965
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:01,038
sort of

966
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,038
tend to find myself in the oils and

967
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,759
soaps category a lot so

968
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,558
i think about some sort of extract that

969
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:08,879
might affect

970
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,158
the mites as a nerve toxin something

971
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,399
like pyrethrin

972
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,600
derived from chrysanthemum i would mix

973
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:17,199
that with an oil

974
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:18,879
that would suffocate maybe another oil

975
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,319
or an extract that would prevent

976
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,760
breeding

977
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,960
prevent feeding and and prevent the

978
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,359
larval development

979
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,120
so something like neem then we need

980
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:30,639
something that's going to mix those

981
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,319
things together and make them more

982
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,000
effective as an application so a

983
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,398
surfactant like soap

984
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,240
and then i like a penetrant i love

985
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:39,199
penetrants to kill eggs whether it's

986
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,079
citric acid

987
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,519
or alcohol or something of that nature

988
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,558
now when we think about what we just

989
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,200
went over

990
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:49,678
oils soaps and alcohols those are also

991
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,720
really effective against powdery mildew

992
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,240
so that's a pretty good synergistic

993
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,679
first pass of hey

994
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,278
that's an application that's going to

995
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,360
kill both of these things

996
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:00,798
it needs to be done appropriately with

997
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,558
the appropriate dilutions

998
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,639
at the appropriate timelines with the

999
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,278
appropriate environmental conditions

1000
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,240
but they are absolutely effective and

1001
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,159
for me

1002
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,878
it's really about understanding what the

1003
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,119
ultimate goal is to get great flower

1004
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,078
so if we can get environmental control

1005
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,559
we can do

1006
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,119
preventative applications during the

1007
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,838
vegetative process build the castle cell

1008
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,399
wall

1009
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,440
and then in the first two weeks of

1010
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,000
flower

1011
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,440
take action if we need to from a

1012
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,320
chemical perspective

1013
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,159
and then kick back and let those plants

1014
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,240
develop without additional foliar

1015
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,760
applications that degrade our product

1016
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:42,000
and compromise our quality in the end so

1017
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,839
sort of my approach there yeah thanks

1018
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,039
jesse that makes a lot of sense it seems

1019
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:46,719
like um

1020
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,159
that ipm triangle has been sort of

1021
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,678
flipped on its head

1022
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,760
uh over the last few decades or

1023
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,960
so and people start with chemical

1024
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,520
control but

1025
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,960
it should be really reversed and started

1026
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:59,599
with chemical control first as a

1027
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,639
preventer

1028
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,960
excuse me cultural control first as a

1029
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,920
prevention method and i think we're

1030
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,679
we're still

1031
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,200
discovering right when i had my hydro

1032
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,480
shop everyone just wanted to come in and

1033
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:12,239
buy a poison

1034
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,240
and i would say like hey think about

1035
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,159
talking to the beneficial insectary

1036
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,679
and seeing what they have available talk

1037
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,319
to dragonfly earth

1038
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:22,239
talk to mammoth p they make microbes

1039
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,440
research dr elaine ingham

1040
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:27,279
look at the soil food web take a look at

1041
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,400
korean natural farming and one straw

1042
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,560
revolution

1043
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,480
look into these other methodologies that

1044
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,639
are historically viable and have worked

1045
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,599
for hundreds of years in other locations

1046
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:39,519
understand what's working for them and

1047
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,960
incorporate that because it's so much

1048
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,280
more cost effective

1049
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,599
with so much less degradation to your

1050
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,720
product if you can take that

1051
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,599
that approach of prevention before the

1052
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,199
intervention

1053
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:56,400
yeah yeah sort of a line of last resort

1054
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:58,159
with uh with the chemicals um

1055
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,480
an interesting question sort of

1056
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:03,440
parlaying on the on the concept of

1057
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,199
of microbes and microbiology and pests

1058
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,280
uh from anders

1059
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:09,199
um he's saying some growers seem to be

1060
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,079
taking a sterile cleanroom approach to

1061
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,838
ipm

1062
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,720
whereas others are utilizing natural

1063
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:16,480
defenses like biologics and beneficials

1064
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,480
do you think a hybrid approach of the

1065
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,400
two methodologies is achievable while

1066
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,838
being practical in day-to-day workflow

1067
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,200
and cost-effective in terms of

1068
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:24,559
production costs

1069
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:26,559
or do you think this approach will

1070
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,679
lessen the efficacies of both schools of

1071
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,000
thought

1072
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:30,960
that's a great question that's a great

1073
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,079
question

1074
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,720
and what i usually say is that every

1075
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,680
facility i've ever been into has pests

1076
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,199
and there are cultivators out there that

1077
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,440
will attest to me walking to their

1078
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,598
facility and them saying hey man

1079
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,559
this room's really clean me flipping

1080
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,320
over a bug

1081
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,838
and or flipping over a plant and saying

1082
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,119
but what about these eggs

1083
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:55,279
what are these guys so in short what i

1084
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,838
would say is it's really really hard to

1085
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,240
have a perfectly sterile environment

1086
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,239
um and then on the flip side of that

1087
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,799
there's there's a benefit to sterility

1088
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,479
you know and i'm a big fan of trying to

1089
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,160
be as clean as possible

1090
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,760
i think what happens is you get these

1091
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,838
two schools of thought and they think

1092
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,359
that they're diametrically opposed

1093
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:17,039
and the reality is is that yes so many

1094
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,400
chemical applications whether it's

1095
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:21,440
hydrogen peroxide

1096
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,160
and acetic acid with xeritol or some

1097
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,159
sort of

1098
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:26,000
other spray like sulfur which is going

1099
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,239
to kill our beneficials

1100
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,358
are not going to work with the

1101
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,199
microbiology

1102
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:33,279
and that's true and i used to say this

1103
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,919
all the time too encouraging people

1104
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,359
that were using synthetic nutrients in

1105
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,920
their feeding schedule

1106
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:41,119
to incorporate compost teas look those

1107
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,639
synthetic nutrients

1108
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,400
some of these chemical poisons and

1109
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,598
toxins will kill

1110
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,320
microbes but the strong will survive so

1111
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,160
if we kill

1112
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,480
60 percent of the microbes with our

1113
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:55,358
sterile approach we still have 40

1114
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,719
of the microbes that don't care about

1115
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,920
what you're throwing at them

1116
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:01,679
so for me yeah i mean there's there is a

1117
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,079
marriage in there somewhere that allows

1118
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,598
for

1119
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,359
realistic application of you know

1120
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,200
a sterile environment and what it takes

1121
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:13,519
to do that while at the same time

1122
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:16,639
embracing microbiology and beneficials

1123
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:19,199
so there's a cost and benefit there but

1124
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:19,759
yes i think it's viable to blend the two

1125
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,639
of them

1126
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,520
um i think the more momentum you can

1127
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,799
build

1128
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:29,119
with microbiology and beneficials

1129
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,960
the better that momentum is what's going

1130
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,559
to carry you through those last four

1131
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,480
weeks of flower

1132
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,239
and if you need to you can apply some of

1133
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,000
these chemicals sterile

1134
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:40,078
approaches but don't be afraid to mix

1135
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,440
the two see see who survives and who the

1136
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,880
strongest ones are

1137
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,200
you know if pathogen pressures are

1138
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,920
cumulative does it make sense to

1139
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:49,118
do as much as you can all the way

1140
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,119
through the cycle

1141
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,440
right you know we we go into rooms where

1142
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,039
they've got the pads full of alcohol

1143
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,880
or whatever some other paralyzing

1144
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,440
media that you step in before you walk

1145
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,720
in we see people gown up

1146
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,039
i've seen that on smaller room grows

1147
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,480
it can be a real hassle in terms of

1148
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:09,519
workflow if you're going from one room

1149
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,880
to another

1150
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,400
and the the movement is uh the duration

1151
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,480
in a room is short

1152
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,519
then it is really gonna hamper your

1153
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,199
workflow but

1154
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,719
when we go to large greenhouses for

1155
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,199
example they're gonna be in this

1156
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:24,078
bay for two hours or three hours at a

1157
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:26,159
time

1158
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,920
um you know what's that break-even point

1159
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,199
is do we do is there a breaking point

1160
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,920
we've noticed

1161
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,279
in the facilities we've been in or

1162
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,240
should we just be doing it all over the

1163
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,320
place

1164
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,479
well i think again it's sort of going

1165
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,160
back and referencing that triangle right

1166
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,920
it's about starting with a culture of

1167
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:43,838
clean and what does it take to get that

1168
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,280
culture of clean and make decisions that

1169
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,440
are appropriate for that

1170
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,119
but then when it comes to plant health

1171
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,599
it's important to think about

1172
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,240
the stages of physical biological and

1173
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,720
then

1174
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,399
chemical so just because you're trying

1175
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,879
to create a clean

1176
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,760
environment doesn't necessarily mean you

1177
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,760
have to

1178
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:06,560
exclude beneficials we are trying to

1179
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,520
create an environment that doesn't have

1180
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:10,639
bad pests and pathogens no pythium no

1181
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,079
botrytis

1182
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:15,838
no powdery mildew no asparalis but those

1183
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,560
are not the beneficials we're bringing

1184
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:18,719
in

1185
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:21,119
so for me it's like let's bring in some

1186
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:23,358
beneficials that work on our behalf

1187
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,960
let's try and keep the room as sterile

1188
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:25,759
and clean as possible in between the

1189
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,679
rums

1190
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,040
gas the room to make sure that we don't

1191
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,759
have that vector

1192
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,039
but at the same time if you think that

1193
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,599
you're going to

1194
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:37,759
skip those first three steps of cultural

1195
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,960
physical and biological control

1196
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,680
it will be very expensive to continue to

1197
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,079
apply

1198
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,838
the right chemicals and the right

1199
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,880
processes to make sure that you have a

1200
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:49,199
sterile environment

1201
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,160
and in the end you're probably not going

1202
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,639
to achieve it

1203
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,159
it's so rare that i've walked into a

1204
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,159
facility and i thought man it's going to

1205
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:58,078
be hard for me to find a pest here

1206
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:59,920
it's usually i just walk walk in and go

1207
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,318
to the mop sink or go to the bathroom

1208
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,079
or go to the doorknob and just like hey

1209
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:05,440
let's do a swab send this off to the lab

1210
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,400
see what comes back and people are

1211
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,000
shocked

1212
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,480
yeah i mean pests are one thing

1213
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,039
maybe there's a way to keep them all out

1214
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,000
but you

1215
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:16,800
talk about microscopic microbes and the

1216
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,280
fact that

1217
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,119
we're shedding microbes off of our skin

1218
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,800
at such a high rate

1219
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,800
i don't i don't have a scary thought

1220
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,960
right it's crazy it's crazy to think

1221
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,000
about i just i don't see how there'd be

1222
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,039
any way

1223
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,679
to really create an entirely sterile

1224
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:33,920
environment

1225
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,598
so to me it makes a lot of sense to

1226
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,920
foster the good microbes

1227
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,640
and the beneficial pests potentially

1228
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,280
because

1229
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,480
i just it just seems like an impossible

1230
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,920
thing to achieve

1231
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,000
and i'll say this though i've seen a lot

1232
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,440
of automation developments in automation

1233
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,480
where we're trying to get more people

1234
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,159
out of that space

1235
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,760
more items out of that space more

1236
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,838
vectors out of that space so instead of

1237
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,920
having someone come in that's wearing

1238
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:57,599
gloves and a tyvek suit that's four

1239
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,119
inches too short on the arm

1240
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,200
and every time they brush against the

1241
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,000
leaf they bring on whatever's on their

1242
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:03,279
arm

1243
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,719
you know now we're trying to get to the

1244
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,640
point where it's like should we automate

1245
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:08,879
this completely should we have

1246
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:09,679
sensors and cameras in the room telling

1247
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,720
us what

1248
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:14,480
pests are there or where we have an

1249
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:15,439
issue in the canopy that looks different

1250
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,679
than the rest of the

1251
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,480
the canopy right and we have you know

1252
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,519
basically a

1253
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,880
running set of you know mechanical

1254
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,280
scissors that come and trim

1255
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,880
up the cannabis appropriately i've seen

1256
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,560
these things explored and

1257
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,240
one of the reasons is because it's so

1258
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,960
hard to keep a room clean

1259
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,399
and people coming in you know they they

1260
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,119
bring in their pests with them a lot of

1261
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,240
times

1262
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:41,440
yeah gosh darn it's uh

1263
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:43,039
yeah i mean you gotta do tissue culture

1264
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,599
to make sure your genetics are clean

1265
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:46,000
make sure

1266
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,119
the media that you're planting the the

1267
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,440
plantlets into

1268
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,519
are clean that you know there's zero

1269
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,800
interference from from humans

1270
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:56,559
and then i mean i guess i wonder also um

1271
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,079
if it's a sterile in fact a sterile

1272
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:01,599
environment what are you missing

1273
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,119
if you don't have beneficial microbes

1274
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,960
within within your ecosystem is

1275
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,720
are you growing good the best plants

1276
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,639
that you can are you getting the terpene

1277
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:14,078
and the cannabinoid content and

1278
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:15,440
the biomass that is potential in the in

1279
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,519
the genetics

1280
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,358
yeah i think there's a whole another

1281
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:21,358
webinar of me

1282
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:22,880
blabbing on my soapbox about how great

1283
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:24,880
microbes are but

1284
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,960
the research is out there and more is

1285
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,280
coming the benefits

1286
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,000
the yield benefits i mean a company that

1287
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,160
i look at

1288
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,119
is is mammoth p you know they work with

1289
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:35,199
a lot of people

1290
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,960
they show you how much more you can

1291
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,078
yield with the benefit of microbes they

1292
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,599
show you how you can

1293
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,280
unlock uh nutrients in a different way

1294
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,280
um but then it's really embracing it

1295
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,960
from a synergistic you know

1296
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,960
position where it's like if you're just

1297
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,199
gonna feed nutrient salts do you have

1298
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,240
the appropriate cation exchange do you

1299
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:55,838
have amino acids do you have b1 vitamins

1300
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,519
it's about thinking about plant health

1301
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:59,358
from a holistic perspective

1302
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:00,800
and microbes play a role whether you

1303
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:02,000
like it or not there are going to be

1304
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,839
microbes on your plant

1305
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,199
even in a sterile environment rob and i

1306
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,599
have talked about this it's like

1307
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:08,480
well maybe we bring hydrogen peroxide

1308
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,119
gas or

1309
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,559
radical oxidative species to the plant

1310
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,280
in order to make sure that the plant's

1311
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,519
sterile

1312
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,760
right but the reality is that's probably

1313
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,759
going to wipe out the beneficial microbe

1314
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,040
cell wall that we have on the plant or

1315
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,760
in the root zone

1316
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,159
that's allowing those those nutrients to

1317
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,319
be

1318
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:27,199
more available or creating nutrients

1319
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:29,440
cycling

1320
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,039
so the plant can eat hundreds and

1321
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,200
hundreds of times a day

1322
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,960
rather than just the one to five times

1323
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:36,799
you feed it

1324
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,720
it's again it's about synergy and it's

1325
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,800
about understanding the risk reward and

1326
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:41,439
costs and cost benefit analysis there

1327
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,680
too

1328
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,639
yeah yeah that's great and just really

1329
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,480
quick uh

1330
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,719
question from from pat jacker just

1331
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,358
really asking for a little elaboration

1332
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,480
here

1333
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:54,239
um about uh just your linkedin post

1334
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,358
about the health of the cuticle

1335
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:59,519
and um the the plant waxes deterring

1336
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:02,318
powdery mildew

1337
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,679
and uh so i think it's a little bit

1338
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:06,000
different than the

1339
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:08,399
systemic acquired response and the plant

1340
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,440
is essentially it has these waxes on it

1341
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,680
that allow it to

1342
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,240
photosynthesize and transpire and deal

1343
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,639
with the external environment

1344
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:17,279
and what i've seen is that you know one

1345
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:20,559
of the biggest

1346
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,880
pest vectors is when leaves die now

1347
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,799
that i believe sends off pheromones from

1348
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,160
the plant that attracts these negative

1349
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,400
insects that say oh

1350
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:29,519
this plant's weak let's come eat it

1351
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,680
right

1352
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,519
and at the same time those dead leaves

1353
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:36,559
are a potential habitat

1354
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:38,639
for powdery mildew or botrytis so

1355
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,719
for me and this is probably a

1356
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,920
conversation that might set rob off

1357
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:46,799
it's about accurately controlling

1358
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,920
the vpd it's about making sure that the

1359
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,240
moisture content

1360
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,200
in the air relative to the leaf tissue

1361
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:54,479
temperature

1362
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:56,719
is appropriate so we're not drying out

1363
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,559
those cuticular waxes we want them to

1364
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,639
remain as long as possible because

1365
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,279
they're the best defense especially in

1366
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,960
late stages against these infestations

1367
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,720
so again it comes back to the tools of

1368
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,679
the trade know how to measure what's in

1369
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:09,598
your space

1370
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:11,039
know how to measure the plant and know

1371
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,119
how to control

1372
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:14,079
so you don't have too much wind or too

1373
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,760
much heat

1374
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,680
that are destroying those waxes and

1375
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:22,079
making the plant more vulnerable

1376
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:22,078
mm-hmm jesse you hit the hot button

1377
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,000
no i just want to disagree with you look

1378
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,800
the particular membrane is a

1379
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,719
very important part of plant physiology

1380
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,519
um

1381
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:37,439
whether it's receptive to vpd or just

1382
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,239
relative humidity of the air

1383
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,159
and air velocity i don't know right you

1384
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:43,759
know i don't know enough about the

1385
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:45,598
particular membrane and what it's

1386
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,560
sensitive to um

1387
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,200
that particular article i yeah i get it

1388
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,480
there is

1389
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:56,159
very good data in that article that

1390
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,679
pat's talking about but um

1391
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:59,759
you know i'm always very sensitive to

1392
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:03,039
leaf canopy temperature right i

1393
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,200
i didn't see that um i didn't see that

1394
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:06,719
touched on heavily enough for my own

1395
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:07,598
liking because whenever we talk about

1396
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:10,399
vpd

1397
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,440
around the office or with anybody it's

1398
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,079
how are you measuring

1399
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,440
vpd is it that we saw that we saw a

1400
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,200
chart in that article

1401
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,960
that is the one that's very popular

1402
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,039
online um

1403
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,880
that's a static chart vpd changes

1404
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,279
constantly and it's

1405
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,039
different in your entire canopy at

1406
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,559
different heights of your canopy

1407
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,880
uh you just have to make a best guess

1408
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,880
with it sometimes using the best tools

1409
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,838
you have we use the cameras

1410
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,760
you know other people have different

1411
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:36,400
tools but that's the only thing i would

1412
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,839
say you know

1413
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,639
vpd is absolutely vital for plant health

1414
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:43,679
the plant has

1415
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:45,598
got lots of vigor it will be able to

1416
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:46,719
fight off all sorts of pests and

1417
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,039
pathogens

1418
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,480
if the relative humidities go off you

1419
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:51,519
know you look at that chart on one of

1420
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,400
the slides

1421
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:56,639
it's the relative humidity where you get

1422
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,838
into the danger zones of pathogen

1423
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:01,598
proliferation so yeah i would say i

1424
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:03,519
you know we've talked about this and we

1425
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:06,318
will continue to talk about this but

1426
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,880
i also think bpd is really important for

1427
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:08,480
bricks

1428
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,800
and if you really want to accumulate

1429
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,400
more sugars and vitamins and minerals

1430
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,720
inside your plant tissue

1431
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,838
it's important to control transpiration

1432
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:18,558
the right way

1433
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,358
and if you want to get to a 12 on the

1434
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,680
brick scale

1435
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,440
you really need to make sure that you're

1436
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,759
appropriately controlling

1437
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,440
vapor pressure deficit so the plant can

1438
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,040
take up the mobile and immobile

1439
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,200
nutrients that it needs

1440
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,079
and redistribute them appropriately so

1441
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,239
that you get

1442
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,359
you know a healthy plant from tip to

1443
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:37,519
stem to root

1444
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:39,119
so when you do that test you know it's

1445
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:41,679
reflecting plant health

1446
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,519
and vpd is one of the ways to get your

1447
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:45,358
bricks higher

1448
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,599
and also i would say that this is one

1449
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:50,799
thing i think we totally agree on rob

1450
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,240
whether it's vpd or relative humidity or

1451
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,200
airflow or whatnot

1452
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,719
those particular waxes are important and

1453
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:58,399
it's just something that we should think

1454
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:00,318
about and consider

1455
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,800
and talk about how to protect and that

1456
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:05,279
was one of the main things i wanted to

1457
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,240
um put out there by sharing todd's

1458
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,640
article was like

1459
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:09,279
hey let's think about these cuticular

1460
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:11,759
waxes

1461
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,400
let's think about vpd let's think about

1462
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,480
humidity

1463
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,639
and and how it plays a role in

1464
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,679
integrated pest management the analog is

1465
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,078
skin health right if

1466
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:20,879
you don't have um you know supple enough

1467
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,559
skin

1468
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,240
if the you know the cholesterol and your

1469
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,359
skin goes away which is you know a

1470
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:30,399
problem with some people

1471
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:33,358
it cracks and this is an infection uh

1472
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,358
zone for your skin right that is true

1473
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:37,279
for plants it's true for people

1474
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:39,039
we have to be very sensitive to it so i

1475
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,839
get that 100 agree

1476
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:44,239
we don't argue about that right got it

1477
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:47,440
so

1478
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:49,439
plant defenses as an ipm strategy built

1479
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,400
really building the the vigor of the

1480
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,000
plant as a

1481
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:57,200
as a an ability to to defend itself

1482
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:01,280
against attacks

1483
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:04,399
yeah cool yeah makes makes good sense

1484
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:09,119
um another one here from francis is

1485
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,119
is there an ipm strategy for curing

1486
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:14,799
yeah i mean i think that it's i think a

1487
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,559
lot of people don't think about

1488
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,000
what happens when you cure or the

1489
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,839
potential for

1490
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,280
pests and a really quick aside story is

1491
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:26,960
i have a friend

1492
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,519
uh who whose dad is sick and was

1493
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,720
had grown grown wheat a long time ago

1494
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:32,880
and he had

1495
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:35,118
put it away when it was far too wet and

1496
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,039
it developed all kinds of problems

1497
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,200
it had all kinds of molds growing on it

1498
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:41,599
and when he would smoke that cannabis

1499
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,118
he would literally pass out he would

1500
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,000
black out and wake back

1501
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,640
up and it was it was hey does weed go

1502
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,800
bad

1503
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:50,558
or you know or is there something in

1504
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,800
these rolling papers that's hurting me

1505
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,720
and

1506
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,000
it wasn't until we really realized like

1507
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:56,480
you know there's probably a lot

1508
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,760
of things in this product that you could

1509
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,000
have

1510
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,200
dealt with before you put it in the jar

1511
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,039
and if you just would have had an

1512
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:04,879
appropriate curing strategy you wouldn't

1513
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,000
have the botrytis the pythium and the

1514
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,599
powdery mildew

1515
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,119
that are all over this cannabis and it

1516
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,200
would be safe to smoke

1517
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,960
um so for me it's also a thing with my

1518
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:14,558
mom it's like when trying to find

1519
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,400
safe cannabis early on in the

1520
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,559
deregulated market people would sell

1521
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,400
anything because there was no testing

1522
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,400
now we have testing it's not just about

1523
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,720
testing for residual pesticides

1524
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,318
it's testing for e coli it's testing for

1525
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:28,799
salmonella it's testing for

1526
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,838
asparalis and these are things that can

1527
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,640
occur

1528
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:34,719
in the curing process so for me it's

1529
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,960
really important to make sure that we

1530
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:37,759
migrate the moisture from the interior

1531
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,119
of the bud

1532
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,720
to the exterior of the bud in a s in a

1533
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,720
linear fashion we don't want the

1534
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,639
moisture to migrate back in

1535
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,399
because then that will trap water inside

1536
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:51,118
that will become anaerobic

1537
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,039
and bring up anaerobic pathogens in

1538
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,800
addition to that we need to make sure

1539
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,119
that the water activity

1540
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,680
inside of the buds when we go to finally

1541
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,519
package them is below 20

1542
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:03,118
everyone's got a different signature

1543
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:04,960
some people in some

1544
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,640
counties are even testing for this which

1545
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,440
i think is really cool

1546
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,318
but the idea is is that if you put

1547
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,280
cannabis

1548
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:14,000
in an airtight environment with water

1549
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,040
activity

1550
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
over 20 it's going to sporulate things

1551
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,000
are going to grow

1552
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,119
in there and if you can get the water

1553
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,838
activity below

1554
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,680
20 then there's not going to be activity

1555
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:27,679
there's not going to be migration inside

1556
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,078
the bud that leads to sporulation of

1557
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:31,358
these

1558
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,359
these pathogens and pests

1559
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,880
and then a lot of people don't filter

1560
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,400
the air in their curing space i mean for

1561
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,760
years i would just hang it in my garage

1562
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,680
and blast it with air

1563
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,040
and then throw away 20 because i'm like

1564
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:42,480
ooh you know you get in there you start

1565
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:44,400
trimming away to roll yourself a joint

1566
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,000
you're like oh that one's moldy let's

1567
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,000
heave-ho on that one and move on to the

1568
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,760
next one knowing that those spores were

1569
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,199
probably just circulated in the space

1570
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,200
without appropriate biological

1571
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,799
filtration or just passing them from one

1572
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:56,960
bud to another

1573
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,720
well i think i think to that end moving

1574
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,679
a lot of air through the room gets that

1575
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:02,000
homogeneity

1576
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:04,000
of the environment which gives you some

1577
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,800
reassurance that every bud

1578
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,639
in the drying and curing area is getting

1579
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,640
a consistent temperature and humidity

1580
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:11,519
around it to keep the moisture moving in

1581
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:13,920
the right direction

1582
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:15,759
so if you move a lot of air and if you

1583
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,519
have the opportunity to move air

1584
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,200
you should be cleaning it as you move it

1585
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:22,719
there's no excuse so

1586
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:25,279
you know we use a strategy um you know

1587
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,318
trapping with high efficiency filtration

1588
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,800
and then

1589
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:31,119
uh photocatalytic oxidation downstream

1590
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,359
to clean the coil but also clean the air

1591
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:35,039
with the molecular shredders and also

1592
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:36,558
seal that room right i mean that's one

1593
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:37,199
of the physical barriers you can do to

1594
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,280
create

1595
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:40,799
pests and pathogens coming in i mean i

1596
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,559
know people too that have had

1597
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,599
a handful of spider mites on their plant

1598
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,960
and they're like no it's pretty good

1599
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,240
it's not affecting my bottom line and

1600
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,880
then they go to cure

1601
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:49,919
and then you know eight days later we've

1602
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,240
had

1603
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,838
thousands and thousands of eggs hatch

1604
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:55,838
and those mites are like man i gotta eat

1605
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:57,039
this really quickly before it dries out

1606
00:53:55,838 --> 00:53:58,639
and all of a sudden you're coming in

1607
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,480
with a vacuum cleaner trying to suck

1608
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:02,078
webbing off of buds that you think are

1609
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,199
going to be sellable

1610
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:08,079
not going to happen yikes

1611
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:08,480
uh well jeff had a question here that i

1612
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,680
think

1613
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,199
was just addressed um about how

1614
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:15,440
important particulate control

1615
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:17,199
is in ipm and how it's best controlled

1616
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,720
in cannabis cultivation

1617
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:22,960
if you guys have anything else to add

1618
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:25,679
there please please do so

1619
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,880
i think um ahead rob no i was just going

1620
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,480
to say i think it's

1621
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,240
it has a lot to do for me about

1622
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,159
third-party testing data

1623
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,838
like if someone says i'm going to do

1624
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,440
this i need to see the proof in the

1625
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:38,318
pudding so many times

1626
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,200
i've been misled by people selling a

1627
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:40,880
product that

1628
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:42,318
hasn't been tested that hasn't been

1629
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,079
tried especially in the emerging

1630
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:45,599
cannabis industry when i had my shop

1631
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,519
every day someone would try and come in

1632
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,440
and sell me something that didn't work

1633
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:50,639
that didn't work and it was up to me to

1634
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,880
do the research

1635
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:54,798
and find out how it worked how it would

1636
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,680
be effective in my facility would it

1637
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:58,960
synergize

1638
00:54:55,679 --> 00:55:01,519
with my team and how i go about ipm

1639
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,480
what are the costs to deploy it and you

1640
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:04,559
know

1641
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,559
so often people aren't thinking about

1642
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,519
the facility and the cultivation space

1643
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,960
as a whole

1644
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:10,960
and all of a sudden people are like oh

1645
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,480
ozone works great just pump it into your

1646
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,358
room and it'll kill everything and it's

1647
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,358
like well

1648
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:16,400
man i've worked in rooms that are filled

1649
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,759
with ozone

1650
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,838
i've left dizzy with nose nosebleeds

1651
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,440
and thought man i didn't have to do much

1652
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:24,159
in there today because everything was

1653
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,318
dead

1654
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:28,318
but am i dying too you know

1655
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,119
yeah yeah that's uh yeah man it's a

1656
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,200
scary thought

1657
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,960
and uh that's balance between risk and

1658
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:38,960
reward right i mean

1659
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,280
some radical oxidative species some

1660
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:45,599
stress to the plant is good

1661
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,599
persistent stress is bad um

1662
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,920
use it to clean the room between plants

1663
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:50,798
sure but do everything else you can to

1664
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,760
prevent

1665
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:54,880
those oxidative species from oxidizing

1666
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,480
the

1667
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,480
terpenes that you're trying to preserve

1668
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,599
or oxidizing the thc you're trying to

1669
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,599
preserve so

1670
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,280
uh and the cell wall cell membranes

1671
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,920
things like that so some of those things

1672
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,480
might be

1673
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,200
totally deployable in a cloning and

1674
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,760
vegetative

1675
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:12,000
and mother room space you know but not

1676
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,760
deployable in a flowering space

1677
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,880
but at the same time understand how

1678
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,319
that's going to affect your other

1679
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,519
approaches is that going to kill the

1680
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:19,440
microbiology

1681
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:21,358
is that going to destroy the rhizophagus

1682
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,639
irregularis that's getting you bigger

1683
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:24,880
roots faster

1684
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:26,879
is that going to kill the glomus mosaic

1685
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,640
that needs six months or six weeks to

1686
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,000
develop in order to keep heavy metals in

1687
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:31,358
the root zone and prevent them from

1688
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,280
going up into the plant

1689
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:34,719
these are compromises you might make by

1690
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,559
bringing in

1691
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:38,959
some other sort of advanced filtration

1692
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,960
technique

1693
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:46,000
got it okay

1694
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,280
good one guys um

1695
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,639
shift gears real quick uh question from

1696
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:58,000
uh chris uh can one unit be utilized to

1697
00:56:52,639 --> 00:57:01,279
control both vegetative and flower stage

1698
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,400
one hvac d unit yeah i believe so

1699
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,760
yes the answer is yes it's okay yes and

1700
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,920
no

1701
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,280
the difference there's there's the

1702
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,760
distinct calculation

1703
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,640
that goes along with a vegetative state

1704
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,200
room

1705
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:16,879
and another one for a flower room and

1706
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:19,118
typically flower has got a

1707
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,480
higher pound per hour moisture removal

1708
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,920
requirement

1709
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,920
the same amount of airflow if the room's

1710
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,760
the same size we'd probably see the same

1711
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,680
airflow every two to three minutes we'd

1712
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,680
be changing the air in the room

1713
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:31,199
um you've got to make sure that if

1714
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:34,558
you're going to use one unit

1715
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:37,039
it can handle the highest load in flower

1716
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,400
and the lowest load in veg so many times

1717
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:41,519
you get into a veg room

1718
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,760
and the minimum stage on the hvac d unit

1719
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:45,358
is pulling too much water out of the

1720
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,160
room and we need humidifiers i mean it's

1721
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:47,440
crazy but

1722
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:49,759
you've got all these room full of

1723
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,798
humidifiers plants then you have to add

1724
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,280
humidification

1725
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:55,838
so our units don't seem to suffer from

1726
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,599
this problem we turn down everything

1727
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:59,039
fans to compressors to the energy

1728
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:02,640
recovery system

1729
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:04,960
um so we can get down to very very small

1730
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:05,679
zero moisture removal just complete

1731
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,519
sensible

1732
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:09,118
and then all the way up to the high

1733
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:10,960
latent removal

1734
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,400
we can do both but you've just got to

1735
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,400
make sure when you're sizing the unit it

1736
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,880
can handle both sides of the spectrum

1737
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,639
i think to piggyback off of that too

1738
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,559
thanks rob that was great and

1739
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:22,000
what i usually say is you know if you

1740
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,319
size the system for your flower

1741
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,760
room then and it's the same space in the

1742
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:27,039
same plant count it should be able to

1743
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,880
handle the bedroom

1744
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:31,440
this question also might be bringing up

1745
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:35,200
the fact that people want to run

1746
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,760
one hvac unit for both their flour and

1747
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:37,838
veg

1748
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,119
and that's where it gets really tricky

1749
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:41,119
right because those can

1750
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,559
those conditional set points are so

1751
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:45,599
different the

1752
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,559
the vpd is different for those spaces

1753
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,000
you know for the

1754
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:52,079
the stage of growth so you might have to

1755
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,358
compromise both spaces if you think

1756
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:57,359
you're going to run

1757
00:58:53,358 --> 00:59:00,480
one unit for flour and veg

1758
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:01,759
but absolutely the same unit if sized

1759
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,639
appropriately could do

1760
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,119
veg or flour the other keyboard being

1761
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:07,118
there

1762
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,720
turn down so you have to have the turn

1763
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,039
down ability to handle

1764
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:14,159
the veg the lower load and veg all the

1765
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:16,318
way up to the higher lord and flower

1766
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:17,519
yep great all right thanks for

1767
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:21,358
clarifying that guys

1768
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:24,480
um on on a similar line of thinking

1769
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:27,039
um anders is asking can some of these

1770
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,599
pesticides some of the essential oils

1771
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:29,519
and pet

1772
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:33,200
and other pesticides being sprayed

1773
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:37,920
indoors damage hvac equipment

1774
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:39,919
good question i think the answer is yes

1775
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,519
radical oxidative species will tear up

1776
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,318
plastics like nobody's business

1777
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:44,960
if you've got a persistent one of them

1778
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:47,838
usually

1779
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,960
what we find is they are i think they

1780
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:52,000
are

1781
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,760
oxidative to you know copper aluminum of

1782
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,159
some sort so

1783
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,960
vaporized hydrogen peroxide as an

1784
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:00,399
example

1785
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:03,119
is vaporized as long as it stays in the

1786
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,240
vapor gas phase we're okay as soon as it

1787
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,920
starts condensing and

1788
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:08,000
landing on the coils you may run into

1789
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,079
problems so if your coils are running

1790
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,639
and cooling and pulling out

1791
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:14,640
turning vaporized hydrogen peroxide into

1792
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:16,078
liquid hydrogen peroxide

1793
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:17,519
at high enough concentrations on the

1794
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,480
coil you'll go over through aluminum

1795
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:21,358
real quick as

1796
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,318
my understanding of it we recommend coil

1797
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:26,880
coatings if that

1798
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:28,400
is your cleaning the room ipm strategy

1799
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,079
so we've seen this come up in a number

1800
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,720
of different projects but

1801
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,318
usually the answer is just don't run

1802
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:36,159
your cooling coils while you're doing

1803
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:36,798
the room cleaning the temperatures rise

1804
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:38,879
up

1805
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:41,280
and allow more of that vaporized

1806
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,480
hydrogen peroxide to get into the air

1807
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,798
because you're just vaporizing so

1808
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,639
got it yeah there's another thing about

1809
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:49,679
that you know anytime you're using uv

1810
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:51,519
light so

1811
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:52,798
uv lights can be used as a surface

1812
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:56,239
cleaner we use them

1813
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:58,239
as part of the pco mechanism to create

1814
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:00,318
the oxidative radicals with the titanium

1815
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:03,759
titanium dioxide mesh

1816
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:06,079
uv light will tear apart plastics again

1817
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,920
you need to have hardened surfaces uv

1818
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,599
hardened surfaces or

1819
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,960
conduit metal conduit for all your

1820
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,079
plastic wiring

1821
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,440
uh plastic sheath wiring inside your air

1822
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,760
handling units and you know you can get

1823
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,519
a

1824
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,040
mile of air of wiring inside an air

1825
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:20,400
handling unit pretty easily

1826
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:22,079
um it's one of those things you don't

1827
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,838
want to overlook because you will start

1828
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,920
shorting out sensors and

1829
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:27,199
start shorting out electrical circuits

1830
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,159
and then

1831
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:30,719
you know pop those in and to add to that

1832
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:32,719
too

1833
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:34,318
this is actually off topic but it just

1834
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:37,118
got me thinking about

1835
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:39,199
what these applications do to the

1836
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,640
machines in your space but also to the

1837
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,558
final product and

1838
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:44,480
you know i've been a big proponent of

1839
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,319
neem for a long time and

1840
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,159
different oils just because they mesh

1841
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:49,358
with my strategy and they have low

1842
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,598
impact on

1843
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:53,598
the environment and the beneficials and

1844
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:55,680
what i started to learn was that

1845
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:57,599
you know i might have a product that's

1846
01:01:55,679 --> 01:02:00,558
considered fantastic

1847
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:02,400
top-tier high-grade flour and then when

1848
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:03,920
i put it through the extraction process

1849
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,599
there have been extractors that pointed

1850
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,680
out to me it's like man i'm getting

1851
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,240
incredible yields out of your product

1852
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:10,000
like

1853
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:11,279
to the point that i don't understand

1854
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,798
what's going on

1855
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,559
and then we dig a little bit deeper and

1856
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:17,199
we realize oh

1857
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:18,240
stylet oil and neem oil are now produ

1858
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:21,279
part of my

1859
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:22,879
extract so just another reason to

1860
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,920
seriously consider

1861
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:28,240
what's going to attach itself to the

1862
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,318
trichomes what's going to attach itself

1863
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:32,959
to the secondary metabolites

1864
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:34,318
bond with that and carry through and the

1865
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,039
casual smoker

1866
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:38,318
in low doses might say man i love it it

1867
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,720
gives it a whole new flavor

1868
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:42,558
or they might say hey i don't you know

1869
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:43,358
this isn't as great a product or it

1870
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,160
might cause

1871
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:48,000
more oxidation in long-term storage or

1872
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:50,399
what triggered it for me was

1873
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,679
knowing that so many extracts

1874
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,760
concentrate

1875
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:56,159
these applications and all of a sudden

1876
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,440
you have heavy metals you have oils in

1877
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:59,199
the concentrate

1878
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,920
even though you did very minimal

1879
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:02,960
application during the growth stages

1880
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,960
wild yeah

1881
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,720
jesse i want to congratulate you for

1882
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,400
saying trichomes the right way

1883
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:10,959
hey i get one right every once in a

1884
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,838
while man hey get one right

1885
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,159
next no i mean you know don't make me

1886
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:17,279
say

1887
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:20,078
pillow or windmill man

1888
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,079
like you just did

1889
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,639
yeah with regard to anders anders

1890
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,920
question as well

1891
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:29,118
it makes me think about the quality of

1892
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,039
your condensate

1893
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:32,480
capture as well right if you're if

1894
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,799
you're pulling in all sorts of

1895
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,000
weird oils and pesticides through your

1896
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:38,719
hvac

1897
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,318
cd system what kind of stuff are you

1898
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:41,679
capturing when you're condensing that

1899
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:43,599
water from the air

1900
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:45,838
and you know what impact does it have on

1901
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:46,480
the ability to recycle that water back

1902
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:49,119
into your

1903
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,480
plants that's a great point man even if

1904
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,599
you're not doing foliar sprays let me

1905
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,240
just throw this out there

1906
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:55,440
you've got a tube with no light in it so

1907
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:57,118
you know you're not going to use your uv

1908
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,000
cleaners in the air handler

1909
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:01,440
um in any configuration to clean inside

1910
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,760
the condensate drain

1911
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,960
condensate running off of the coil will

1912
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,280
pick up all this

1913
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:09,199
micro particle stuff that's not

1914
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,319
pathogens necessarily but it's dirt and

1915
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:12,399
then these dirt

1916
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:14,079
become these dirt balls and these dirt

1917
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,760
balls become nucleation sites for

1918
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,519
bacteria and it's hard to get rid of all

1919
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,839
the bacteria

1920
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:21,358
uh you know anywhere in an air handling

1921
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:22,239
unit or in a room like we're talking

1922
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,038
about

1923
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:26,078
um whether you're doing sprays or not

1924
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,440
condensate drain

1925
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:31,119
water needs to be analyzed and treated

1926
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,039
um and probably purified in some way

1927
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,400
shape or form before you try and put it

1928
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,440
back into the room

1929
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,760
um but just like you said if

1930
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,440
your if any of this oil makes it through

1931
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,440
the particulate capture system

1932
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,119
and makes it onto the coil the

1933
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,960
condensate coming off is a

1934
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,240
stream of water that's going to clean

1935
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,519
off that coil and it's going to end up

1936
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:52,479
in the condensate

1937
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:54,000
no sensor no i i like what you're saying

1938
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,318
and as a guy who loves to

1939
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,760
recycle 100 of my water it's one of the

1940
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:00,639
reasons why i sort of

1941
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,760
steer in that oils and soaps world

1942
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:03,759
because

1943
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,839
the bacteria and the fungi that

1944
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,839
accumulate in the condensate drains

1945
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:09,038
i'm okay dealing with remediation

1946
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:11,599
through compost tea

1947
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:13,599
through fermentation through breeding of

1948
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:15,680
billions of good microbes that consume

1949
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:16,480
the bad microbes and outperform them in

1950
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:18,719
a space

1951
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,880
and an environment in the tea brewer

1952
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:22,959
where they're guaranteed to win

1953
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,880
the biggest problems for me is like what

1954
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,880
else is coming out of that room

1955
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,920
how much sulfur is coming into that

1956
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,680
space

1957
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,119
what other acids and chemicals are

1958
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:32,960
coming into the space that are

1959
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:35,440
compromising my ability

1960
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,240
to recycle the water and messing up with

1961
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,039
my tea

1962
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:40,879
or becoming consumed by the microbiology

1963
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,760
in my tea and then redelivered to the

1964
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,240
root zone

1965
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,000
in a super available way that now is

1966
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:48,159
absorbed into the plant

1967
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,679
is you know there's a lot of unhealthy

1968
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:52,480
things to think about when it comes to

1969
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,480
that perspective

1970
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:57,359
geez that's that's amazing lots of

1971
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,639
interesting stuff to consider

1972
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:02,000
um another one from andy here um

1973
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:05,838
have you had success getting rid of

1974
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,838
fusarium into cannabis grow

1975
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,599
yeah i mean i think a lot of times

1976
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,280
people see it and they're like oh man

1977
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,000
i'm going to spray hydrogen peroxide

1978
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,880
that's my only option and man when it

1979
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,519
comes to

1980
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,720
systemic fungal colonies coming through

1981
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,519
the root zone and coming through the

1982
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:21,038
water

1983
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,199
you need to go back and get cultural

1984
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,319
control it's really the only option you

1985
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:27,199
have to

1986
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:28,400
treat that water so maybe it's about

1987
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:30,000
getting a water test

1988
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,400
and understanding what's in your water

1989
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,318
as it comes in just like rob said as you

1990
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,000
recycle it let's learn about the

1991
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,159
microbes that are in there let's

1992
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,599
let's make sure that we you know

1993
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:42,798
remediate with uv

1994
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,240
filtration or some sort of treatment

1995
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:44,798
ozone treatment or something in the

1996
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:46,798
water

1997
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:48,480
and then have a secondary process to

1998
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:49,038
make sure that we're not putting ozone

1999
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,240
and uv

2000
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:53,359
into the root zone but absolutely

2001
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:56,318
there's some

2002
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:58,078
some spot fixes that people do i think a

2003
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:00,239
lot of people like to run

2004
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:02,318
systemic microbes you know get as many

2005
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:03,919
fungal and bacterial colonies on and in

2006
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,599
the plant as possible so they can

2007
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,760
prevent the uptake of that

2008
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,359
so they can filter that horrid water as

2009
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,760
it comes into the root zone

2010
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:12,960
but in the end it's a water mold and you

2011
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,440
need to deal with

2012
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,358
standing water in the space possible

2013
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:21,039
drips from condensate lines

2014
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:22,798
filters leaks anaerobic water pools

2015
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:24,000
water if you clean the room and you push

2016
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:25,440
everything into the hallway and you

2017
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,358
don't clean the hallway

2018
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,440
bam there you go water molds in the

2019
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:31,358
hallway mop sink

2020
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,639
water molds like any place where water

2021
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:34,400
is going to stagnate

2022
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:35,838
needs to be addressed and it comes down

2023
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,838
to that culture of clean

2024
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:39,599
in addition to dealing with the water

2025
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:42,078
and there's almost no point

2026
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:42,960
in going in and fighting pythium or

2027
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:45,599
fusarium

2028
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,240
in the space on the plant until you get

2029
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:49,280
control

2030
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:51,759
of the water system otherwise it's just

2031
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:54,640
a it's a battle you're not gonna win

2032
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,160
right yeah it makes sense it's uh attack

2033
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:57,759
the source not not

2034
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,159
don't don't put a band-aid try and put a

2035
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,880
band-aid on it and once you get control

2036
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,598
of the culture

2037
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,358
then your applications to take that

2038
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:08,079
fruserium and pythium

2039
01:08:05,358 --> 01:08:09,679
rhizo rhizoctonia anything like that out

2040
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:10,559
of the picture will be that much more

2041
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:13,199
effective

2042
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:15,280
because instead of battling the incoming

2043
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:16,960
of new stuff you've stopped that

2044
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,719
and now you can let good microbes take

2045
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,198
hold or good chemistry

2046
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,880
ward off the effects but in the end you

2047
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:24,719
know a lot of times i see people go to

2048
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,759
tissue culture after that experience and

2049
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:27,920
they think oh man

2050
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:29,838
i need to remove the epigenetic material

2051
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,759
i need to get back to a stasis

2052
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:33,838
i need to start from a genetic beginning

2053
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:34,798
again so i'm not battling this with the

2054
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:36,559
cuttings that i

2055
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:38,640
maybe got from my mom because if you fed

2056
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,000
your mother plant that same water

2057
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,759
now you should think about getting rid

2058
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,880
of all your mother plants or treating it

2059
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:47,838
with systemic bacteria and fungus

2060
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:50,838
yeah jim is asking how do i determine if

2061
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:52,719
something is a nutrient deficiency or a

2062
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:54,158
pest sure

2063
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:56,239
i think a lot of times it comes back

2064
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:57,519
down to scouting so for me when i walk

2065
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:59,198
into a facility

2066
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,799
i like to take a look at the canopy as a

2067
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:02,639
whole i like to find

2068
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:05,119
plants or spaces that look a little bit

2069
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,480
differently than the rest of the canopy

2070
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:08,318
and then i immediately go there and

2071
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:10,318
address it with my microscope i look on

2072
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:12,080
the leaf surface i look on the back side

2073
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,319
of the leaf i look on the stem

2074
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:16,079
i look in the media i'm looking for

2075
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,319
larva i'm looking for eggs

2076
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:20,079
i'm looking for bugs that's always my

2077
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,640
first spot you know like

2078
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:24,238
let's find the pest that's killing this

2079
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,880
if i can't find any pests

2080
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:28,718
if i can't find pustules if i don't see

2081
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,920
the black dots the initial formation of

2082
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,838
powdery mildew

2083
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,960
then i think of fertigation as the

2084
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:35,198
remediation

2085
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,679
and i think okay what's going on is this

2086
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:38,158
emitter on these group of plants working

2087
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:40,000
right

2088
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:42,000
are we delivering the appropriate amount

2089
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,880
of nutrition do we have

2090
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,079
a nutrient lock up but for me if you go

2091
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,440
through those steps

2092
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:52,000
and you you can't identify a pest

2093
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:53,919
on the plant or in the space then it's

2094
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,960
probably nutrient or environmental

2095
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,359
related

2096
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,000
so go back change your fertigation

2097
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:01,039
schedule

2098
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,079
think about what that might be what

2099
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:03,679
might have caused that

2100
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:05,119
try and link that up with some pictures

2101
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,640
you see

2102
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:08,800
and get a balanced delivery of

2103
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,960
fertigation back to the

2104
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,039
back to the plant or what i would do is

2105
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,119
say come heavy with seaweed because

2106
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:16,640
it'll trigger systemic acquired response

2107
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:18,000
and it'll be a bunch of micronutrients

2108
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,360
to help your plant recover as quick as

2109
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,279
possible

2110
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:23,039
you know if you're losing if you're

2111
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:24,399
losing emitters you know

2112
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:26,158
a good control system is going to tell

2113
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:27,198
you that right if you're tracking like

2114
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:30,479
we do

2115
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:31,678
uh moisture removal across the course of

2116
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:33,359
a day

2117
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,960
and we're stacking it on day on day and

2118
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:36,238
day we know if we're getting to the end

2119
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,079
of the cycle

2120
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:39,839
and the water transpiration rate starts

2121
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:41,359
to fall off that

2122
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,640
it's probably an emitter problem or some

2123
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:44,079
sort of watering problem that'll be the

2124
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,280
first place to look and you know we

2125
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:48,158
alarm off that on

2126
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:49,519
our control system so um i think there's

2127
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:51,439
ways to just kind of

2128
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,040
get that one in the bud uh if you've got

2129
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:54,319
a good control system i'm not sure about

2130
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:56,158
the other ones though

2131
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:57,359
yeah and a lot of times like you know it

2132
01:10:56,158 --> 01:10:58,879
just ends up being

2133
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:00,960
depending on your fertigation it's a

2134
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,520
salt buildup or a buildup in the lines

2135
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,960
or

2136
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,480
glomulin or something preventing that

2137
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,239
that plant from getting the appropriate

2138
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:09,359
dose of nutrition on the large scale

2139
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:11,198
that tends to be

2140
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:12,719
with a with a professional fertigation

2141
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:14,479
approach that tends to be like the

2142
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,319
number one problem

2143
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:17,839
and then then we can go ahead and take a

2144
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:19,679
look at changing the dose but if the

2145
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:22,719
rest of the canopy looks good

2146
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:24,399
isolate that space isolate that plant

2147
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:26,399
think about what's specifically wrong

2148
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:28,799
with the controls

2149
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:30,639
the physical and cultural space for that

2150
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,360
plant

2151
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:35,119
yeah and pat makes a good point uh about

2152
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:37,839
identifying the the

2153
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:40,319
damage to the to the plant tissue as

2154
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:43,440
being a good way to tell uh if

2155
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:45,599
it's a pest that's a great one like in a

2156
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:46,238
lot of ways i can spot a pest from a few

2157
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,480
feet away

2158
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:49,919
if it's speckling on the top side of the

2159
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:51,519
leaves depending on the size of the

2160
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,158
speckling i'm like oh you have mite

2161
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,159
issues

2162
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:55,679
you see the lines in the in the plant

2163
01:11:54,158 --> 01:11:57,679
you've got um

2164
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,760
you know some sort of leaf miner if

2165
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:01,679
you've got a big juicy bud

2166
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,800
outside in one little brown spot you've

2167
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,880
got caterpillars

2168
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,560
go quickly spray some bacillus

2169
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,640
thuringieneses spray it in the morning

2170
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,320
so it has time to work and

2171
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,079
not be affected by the sun release some

2172
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:13,279
trichogama wasps you know think about

2173
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:14,640
the local hatch rate

2174
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:16,559
there's a lot of stuff you can do to

2175
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,719
sort of you know

2176
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,800
take a look at the damage and get a

2177
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:22,158
really good idea of what's going on due

2178
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,320
to the damage because you might not

2179
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:26,319
always find a pest

2180
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:27,759
pat's actually absolutely right but if

2181
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:29,439
you do see the damage that's just

2182
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,119
another sign an indicator of what's

2183
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:34,158
going on in the space

2184
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:36,079
yeah perfect perfect all right final

2185
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:37,759
final question here and we can we can

2186
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:39,119
call it a wrap uh what are the

2187
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:42,719
advantages of pco

2188
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:45,599
over uv uh also hepa versus merv 13

2189
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,600
versus merv 8.

2190
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:53,760
man please so

2191
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:58,319
as i mentioned before we use uv in pco

2192
01:12:53,760 --> 01:13:00,800
um it is activating the titanium dioxide

2193
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:02,319
catalytic reaction to disassociate water

2194
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,560
molecules in the air

2195
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:05,599
create these oh negative hydroxyl

2196
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:09,280
radicals

2197
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:12,079
and for that eight inch window we are

2198
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:13,279
creating a very highly oxidative

2199
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:14,800
airstream

2200
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:16,960
eight inches just downstream of our

2201
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,440
cooling coil that anything running

2202
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,719
through it

2203
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:23,439
in that eight inches it's enough um

2204
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,319
it's enough exposure to the oxidation to

2205
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:27,439
basically

2206
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:30,158
shred the liquid well the

2207
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:32,000
casing on a virus or spore you know even

2208
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:32,399
tear apart vocs and odors and things

2209
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,158
like that

2210
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:39,439
so um that's different than uv

2211
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:41,279
so uv light requires a dose over a long

2212
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:43,599
period of time

2213
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:44,880
it's a uv is a good surface cleaner but

2214
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,000
if i'm going to try and get a particle

2215
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,239
of air that's traveling

2216
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,920
at 500 feet per minute through my air

2217
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:50,959
handler and 1100 feet per minute through

2218
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:54,560
my duct

2219
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:57,198
i need 40 feet 60 feet of

2220
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:00,400
uv light at a high intensity throughout

2221
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:03,839
that entire

2222
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:06,719
now again uv light great surface cleaner

2223
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:08,719
not so great particulate killer um or

2224
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,359
particular

2225
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:12,480
you know disabler because you just need

2226
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:14,880
so much of it

2227
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:16,000
we know those systems are out there if

2228
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,400
that's your preference

2229
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,520
fine but i just i don't understand what

2230
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:21,119
you know the maintenance costs

2231
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,520
associated with having

2232
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:24,880
such a high intensity uv light changing

2233
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,120
the bulbs all the time

2234
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,719
having access into that ductwork i just

2235
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:31,359
see it being problematic

2236
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:32,399
um that's the difference between uv and

2237
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:35,839
pcm

2238
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:39,599
so i hope that made sense in terms of

2239
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:43,360
filter you know particulate filtration

2240
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:45,840
hepa merv 13 merv 8 the lower you go

2241
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:47,679
so hepa is our merv 16 or yeah it

2242
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:50,880
happens over 16 plus

2243
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:51,679
um merv 13 and then merv 8 the lower the

2244
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,159
number

2245
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:55,760
the more of the smaller particles are

2246
01:14:54,158 --> 01:14:58,639
going to get through

2247
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,320
a mirror 13 is not perfect at capturing

2248
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:03,760
all of the particulate

2249
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:04,719
that we want to stop you know one micron

2250
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,199
and above

2251
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:08,560
but it does a very good job of it hepa's

2252
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:10,399
you know there's a balance point here

2253
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,520
you're going to spend

2254
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:15,279
a lot more energy moving air

2255
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,360
through a hepa filter which has just got

2256
01:15:15,279 --> 01:15:19,279
smaller holes which is why it's doing so

2257
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:22,479
much more particulate capture

2258
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:25,599
than you are in a mirror 13 filter

2259
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:28,479
and also you know mir-13 equivalence or

2260
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,480
hepa equivalents

2261
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:32,559
have the lower pressure drop and we

2262
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,960
prefer to use those instead

2263
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,880
um it's a balancing point they never

2264
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,719
been moved they just they're a sieve to

2265
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,359
the things that we think are a problem

2266
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:42,800
murph 13s do a really good job with the

2267
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:44,399
pco downstream

2268
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,320
doing the coil cleaning and the

2269
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:47,359
airstream cleaning i think we've got a

2270
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:49,519
pretty good one too

2271
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:50,559
it's good balance between energy

2272
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,080
consumption

2273
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:55,520
and air cleaning for sure so uh

2274
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:57,840
i know that was supposed to be the last

2275
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,760
question but you know when we announced

2276
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:03,039
this webinar i got a handful

2277
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,159
of questions from legacy growers from my

2278
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:05,679
friends in the industry

2279
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:07,359
from people that asked me if i was going

2280
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:10,158
to sort of tackle the

2281
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:11,679
conversation about micro dosing and i

2282
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:13,359
think it's an important thing to talk

2283
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,279
about right

2284
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:16,639
when i first heard the term micro dosing

2285
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:18,800
it was you know

2286
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,239
i immediately thought yeah sure do some

2287
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,600
mushrooms and go to work man you might

2288
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:23,919
be more creative

2289
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,880
sounds like a great idea to me but then

2290
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,719
i realized that

2291
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,319
my friends were talking about you know

2292
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,719
micro dosing you know

2293
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:33,519
eagle 20 and tetrasan and forbid and

2294
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:36,399
merit wp and these banned substances

2295
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,520
and i came from an industry where we had

2296
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:40,639
to use what was

2297
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:42,400
available there was a lack of regulation

2298
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:44,159
there was a lack of study and there was

2299
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:45,839
a lack of knowledge so

2300
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:47,759
we grabbed for the things that were

2301
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,239
commercially viable in

2302
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,880
in commercial agriculture and we utilize

2303
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:53,678
them and if you utilize them

2304
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:56,800
inappropriately there are

2305
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:58,158
huge consequences yeah you'll fail a

2306
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,279
test you'll have to destroy

2307
01:16:58,158 --> 01:17:03,439
product it'll be a brand black eye

2308
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:04,880
it's you might pass a test when it comes

2309
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:06,799
to buds but then you're going to fail a

2310
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:09,359
test when it comes to concentrates

2311
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,960
but here's my real cautious tale here

2312
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:12,000
i've been growing cannabis for a really

2313
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,239
long time

2314
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,600
and before i knew any better i used

2315
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:17,519
banned substances

2316
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,679
and then i decided that i was going to

2317
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,880
have a family i've been with my wife for

2318
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:23,920
over 20 years

2319
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:26,159
and it was really really hard and i

2320
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:29,199
couldn't figure out why it was so hard

2321
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:31,679
we were trying so much but we weren't

2322
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:33,119
having kids and what i realized was

2323
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:36,079
maybe it has something to do

2324
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:36,479
with this stuff getting absorbed into my

2325
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:39,279
skin

2326
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:42,079
into my body what are these systemic

2327
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:45,279
pesticides doing to me as a person

2328
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:46,960
so i completely stopped i got away from

2329
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:48,960
every pesticide that i did not

2330
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:51,840
understand everything that i thought

2331
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,399
may or may not be banned and six months

2332
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,239
later

2333
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:56,559
my wife and i had our first kid miles

2334
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:58,399
what so to me

2335
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,000
yeah you do whatever it's a personal

2336
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,960
choice it's a business choice but in

2337
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,880
reality

2338
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,239
there are consequences that you might

2339
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,880
not be thinking about

2340
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:08,319
and that's just my personal story so it

2341
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,800
doesn't resonate with everybody

2342
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:11,359
but the reality is i think that is the

2343
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,199
reason

2344
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:15,198
why we were unable to have children for

2345
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:18,799
