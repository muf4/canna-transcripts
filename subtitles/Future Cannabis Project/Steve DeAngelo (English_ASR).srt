1
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:19,060
you know when when when Ronald Reagan

2
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,949
started his escalated war on drugs that

3
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:22,689
was back in the days when most of the

4
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:25,480
weed that came into the country was

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,368
coming from Colombia and a lot of it

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,919
most of it probably was was coming on

7
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:32,769
boats was coming on ships and so one of

8
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:34,840
the very first targets of that war which

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,629
started with the war on cannabis were

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,090
boats that were carrying cannabis that

11
00:00:37,628 --> 00:00:42,428
was when the zero tolerance policy was

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,620
first implemented and the Coast Guard

13
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:47,109
went around seizing people's boats and

14
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:48,579
ships and even rather sizable vessels

15
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:50,800
because they would find a joint or a

16
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:54,009
half a joint and that's that's where

17
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,408
that first zero tolerance term was clean

18
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:58,689
so I think it's really significant that

19
00:00:56,408 --> 00:01:01,600
as we are here gathered to think about

20
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:05,679
the state of cannabis and where we are

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,170
at today that susan was able to report

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,118
this news that we have liberated the

23
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,368
Queen Mary that she has Pluto buried the

24
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:19,780
Queen Mary I think it's a great sign of

25
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:21,430
what's coming in the future so how many

26
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,659
of you are working harder than you ever

27
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:27,130
have in your lives before okay and how

28
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:30,640
many of you are loving it more than

29
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:34,959
anything you've ever done yeah okay me

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,118
too right so I'm like so busy doing

31
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,009
stuff these days I never have enough

32
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,629
time to prepare as much as I want to for

33
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:43,090
anything that I do and I'm afraid that's

34
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:45,280
a little bit the case this morning so I

35
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,590
got a lot of important ideas that I'd

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,450
like to share with you I may wander off

37
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,950
and get a little lost from time to time

38
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,840
and need to come back to my notes and

39
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:56,379
get an anchor back again so bear with me

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:05,439
as we go through this the state of

41
00:01:56,379 --> 00:02:08,379
cannabis right well I am really pleased

42
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,538
and proud and happy to report to all of

43
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:12,460
you if you don't know it yet right that

44
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:15,519
the state of cannabis is strong and

45
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,620
getting stronger every day and our

46
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,610
future is bright and getting brighter

47
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,219
every day

48
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:25,930
we're not entirely out of the shadows

49
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:29,469
yet but the worst of the darkness is

50
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:34,689
behind us and our ultimate goals are

51
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:37,610
within reach there's good news almost

52
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:40,129
everywhere we look right there's only

53
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,790
ten states and the united states now

54
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:48,379
that have failed to pass some kind of

55
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:51,379
cannabis reform law only ten every year

56
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:53,569
the Congress passes the far Rohrbacher

57
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,669
amendment which protects those state

58
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:58,489
laws by blocking the DOJ from

59
00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:01,969
interfering with them by larger and

60
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:04,400
larger margins every year including many

61
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:07,039
many Republican votes right and the 9th

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,990
Circuit Court of Appeals has just

63
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,909
affirmed that the far Rohrbacher

64
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:15,110
amendment means exactly what it says

65
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:16,849
the DOJ cannot prosecute anybody who is

66
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,660
acting in compliance with their state

67
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:22,879
cannabis laws take a look at Congress

68
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:25,090
now in the Senate and in the house we've

69
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,859
got several really groundbreaking

70
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,420
cannabis measures that are pending and

71
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,650
and they're gaining more and more

72
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:33,589
support we're not sure when they're

73
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,240
going to start passing but more and more

74
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,890
of them are gaining support and it's

75
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,680
only inevitable that we'll see their

76
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:42,799
passage

77
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:46,819
presidential campaign for the very first

78
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,830
time in history we have both both the

79
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:51,590
general election candidates from both

80
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,600
parties Democratic and Republican who

81
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:58,250
have publicly expressed support for

82
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,959
medical cannabis I remember when we

83
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,550
couldn't even get a joke out of them and

84
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,569
then all we got was jokes for a while

85
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:07,580
right well not anymore not anymore and

86
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:09,379
this is going to continue right this

87
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,300
will continue for the rest of the Obama

88
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:14,599
administration will continue to see this

89
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:17,480
gradual dismantling of federal

90
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,589
prohibition and if Hillary Clinton

91
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:24,560
becomes president yeah may slow down

92
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:28,939
okay but federal reform won't stop and

93
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,040
even if Trump is is elected okay he and

94
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:31,910
probably more importantly the people

95
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,550
associated with

96
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,530
may be able to completely stop reform at

97
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,350
the federal level that could happen but

98
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:41,689
they will not they will not be able to

99
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,730
roll us back here in the states of the

100
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:48,649
state level we will continue taking a

101
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:53,560
territory and making a reform more good

102
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:56,359
news more good news a new legal

103
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,259
profitable cannabis industry has been

104
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,840
created we went from no such thing to

105
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:08,149
the most rapidly growing industry in

106
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:11,179
America in a decade in a decade right so

107
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:12,949
we've harnessed the engine of free

108
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,500
enterprise to the Train of social

109
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:19,339
justice and there is no stopping us now

110
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,009
there's no stopping us now increasingly

111
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:25,519
moving forward a funding from that

112
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:26,990
industry is going to supplant and

113
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,939
supplement the funding from

114
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,740
philanthropists god bless them who we've

115
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:32,569
had to rely on all of these years for

116
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,910
funding this movement okay time for the

117
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:41,930
industry to step up and start doing its

118
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:44,930
job so you know we don't need to

119
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,540
speculate anymore what happens when we

120
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,379
do reform the laws right there's like

121
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:53,870
this long long demonstrable track record

122
00:05:51,379 --> 00:06:00,459
of benefits that flow to reform stays

123
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:04,910
okay jobs investment up tourism up

124
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:11,889
construction up pharmaceutical drug

125
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:15,890
fatalities down 25% 17,000 lives

126
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:19,969
17,000 lives we've saved binge drinking

127
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:23,930
down domestic violence down violent

128
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:26,240
crime down okay the list of benefits is

129
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,250
so long and so impressive it's just

130
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,889
going to powerfully powerfully

131
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,709
reinforced the efforts of all of these

132
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:41,209
activists who increasingly are going to

133
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:43,399
be funded by industry and this

134
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:45,199
acceleration this acceleration of reform

135
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,819
right has brought a whole new wave a

136
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,339
whole

137
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:51,759
new wave of professionals into the

138
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:54,639
industry people who just didn't feel

139
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,550
safe before and they're bringing with

140
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,209
them a whole new range of experience and

141
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:04,900
skills and credibility that we've never

142
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:07,239
had in the industry before and some of

143
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:09,849
those professionals have started the

144
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,009
first dedicated investment funds in the

145
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:15,670
space and the investments that those

146
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:18,969
funds are making are in turn attracting

147
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:22,710
even more folks more professionals more

148
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:27,270
seasoned people coming into the industry

149
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:30,279
and they their presence is really

150
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:32,109
powerfully dampening the stigma that's

151
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,239
associated with cannabis they have lots

152
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,520
of friends and lots of influence and so

153
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,000
the stigma is being reduced reduced and

154
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:43,589
and reform is accelerating as a result

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,790
of their presence right and the the

156
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:50,369
financial success of the industry is

157
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:54,100
encouraging and motivating ever

158
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,649
increasing numbers of individuals of

159
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,900
businesses of organizations of elected

160
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:02,049
representatives who maybe they were

161
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:04,509
opposed to us a few years ago or at best

162
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,430
neutral and now they're like turning

163
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:11,009
into our best friends they're promoting

164
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:14,079
and defending the industry right why

165
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:16,719
America loves a winner and we're winning

166
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,439
now it's a big difference it's a big

167
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:24,460
difference so that doesn't mean there's

168
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:28,000
not bad news there's still plenty of bad

169
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:31,569
news in the world of cannabis we just

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,490
saw the Neanderthals at the DEA for the

171
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:36,159
umpteenth time

172
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:39,820
despite the mountain of evidence to the

173
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,329
contrary refused to reschedule or D

174
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:46,270
scheduled cannabis right and of course

175
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:48,970
big pharma right there by their sides

176
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:51,370
one of the most disgusting things that

177
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,040
I've seen recently in the world of

178
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:57,039
cannabis as this company called insists

179
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:59,599
insists is the large is the manufacturer

180
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,969
of fentanyl one of the most

181
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,100
deadly and addictive substances on the

182
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,600
planet you may have been hearing about

183
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,610
all these people who are dropping dead

184
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,860
across the country because of fentanyl

185
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:16,490
well these disorganisation right is the

186
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:20,990
largest funder of the No campaign on

187
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:25,818
cannabis legalization in Arizona is that

188
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:28,100
despicable so still bad news still way

189
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:31,129
too many of our sisters and our brothers

190
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:34,100
who are getting arrested my friend James

191
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:36,100
Slavik is here somewhere and and James

192
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,050
was just had this horrible thing

193
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,269
happened to him and there's far too many

194
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:45,049
people that are getting arrested and are

195
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:46,879
being put on trial and are being their

196
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:50,328
lives are being ruined still to this day

197
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:52,159
in California across the country around

198
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:56,359
the world and and they're

199
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:58,039
disproportionately people of color so

200
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,889
yeah there's still some still some

201
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:06,379
things we have to get done sometimes

202
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:08,089
sometimes the bad news is just like the

203
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:11,990
flipside of the good news right

204
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:13,939
so regulations we're seeing the passage

205
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:19,100
of regulations it seems like everywhere

206
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:22,429
I see counties cities states that's a

207
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,680
good thing it's a good thing we're never

208
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:28,039
going to get cannabis into the medicine

209
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:31,849
cabinet of every American family without

210
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:33,828
those kinds of regulations but for some

211
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:37,310
people for some legacy cannabis

212
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:39,769
entrepreneurs for many people they're

213
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:42,409
gonna have devastating effect like the

214
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:45,250
mercer regulations are going to on small

215
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:49,879
manufacturers and small growers in

216
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:52,250
california and it's wonderful to see new

217
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,649
entrants coming into the industry with

218
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,659
new skills and new abilities to reach

219
00:10:54,649 --> 00:11:01,039
out to the mainstream and new ways to

220
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:03,620
influence decision makers but they often

221
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:06,860
also come along with a much greater

222
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:11,720
ability to get financing to get capital

223
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:13,699
to scale up and sometimes they introduce

224
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,528
to business models to the cannabis

225
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:16,789
industry that forced people like me to

226
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:19,370
change the way that we've done things

227
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:24,049
for years and and and sometimes decades

228
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:26,659
right so we're gonna have to learn to

229
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:29,028
adapt all the folks who have been in

230
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:31,309
this industry for 10 or 20 years are

231
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:33,379
going to need to adapt to a greatly

232
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:35,568
heightened level of competitive

233
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:37,278
intensity and we're going to have to

234
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:39,259
learn how to work together with people

235
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,370
who come from very different backgrounds

236
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:42,560
than ours

237
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:47,688
very different cultures and maybe

238
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:52,099
different value sets and the financial

239
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:54,230
success of the industry is it's it's

240
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,459
wonderful right it's great to see people

241
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,909
coming in who really know how to make

242
00:11:55,458 --> 00:12:01,399
money but sometimes we see those folks

243
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:03,649
who are coming into the industry using

244
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,948
their established financial power and

245
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:10,068
their political influence to create

246
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:13,008
protected niches for themselves in the

247
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:14,838
marketplace so a one really close to

248
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:17,110
home example of that in the state of

249
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,730
California is the mandatory distribution

250
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,639
requirements in the newly passed medical

251
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:25,459
cannabis regulations they were enacted

252
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,970
at the behest of what I call the unholy

253
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:33,078
alliance big alcohol the Teamsters Union

254
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:35,269
and the law enforcement organizations

255
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:37,429
none of those organizations have ever

256
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:40,389
been friends of our movement or lifted a

257
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:43,099
finger to make cannabis legal right and

258
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:45,259
the provision that they're backing could

259
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,189
double or triple the price of cannabis

260
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:50,750
for medical patients in California

261
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:53,899
there's other examples of this kind of

262
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:56,259
nonsense around the country so Nevada

263
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:59,089
initiative has a provision in it that

264
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:00,980
exclusively gives all distribution

265
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:05,839
licenses for cannabis to alcohol

266
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:08,839
companies exclusively where Florida's

267
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,300
kind of sorta maybe almost medical

268
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,850
cannabis law that restricts licenses to

269
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:21,219
nurseries that have been existence for

270
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:24,460
30 years or more so manipulation of

271
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,889
legislation of regulation has

272
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:30,430
already become a central business tactic

273
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:31,750
and new and existing cannabis businesses

274
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:34,389
are going to need to be prepared to

275
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:38,950
engage with regulatory agencies to

276
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:42,069
engage with legislators to defend their

277
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:44,290
interests and make sure that this is a

278
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:49,120
market they can continue to participate

279
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:52,000
in and more flipside to good news right

280
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,950
it's great to see capital finally

281
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,870
flowing into the industry because for a

282
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:59,530
long time it was one of the major

283
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:02,560
obstacles we had to growth but that

284
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:04,179
capital is coming in largely at the

285
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,000
service of the strongest and most

286
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:09,309
successful companies and those companies

287
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,539
are using the capital to grow and to

288
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:14,979
consolidate their positions and as they

289
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:17,439
do that there will be more of them and

290
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,810
less smaller companies right we're at

291
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,550
the the beginning of the classic bell

292
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:23,349
curve that you see in all boom

293
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:26,199
industries it goes like this

294
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,550
the bell curve and and we're right at

295
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,770
the beginning of it now where it's

296
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:31,329
shooting up really really quickly right

297
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,460
we've got new entrepreneurs and new

298
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,710
investors they're jumping in every

299
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,620
single day and that's gonna keep

300
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:40,720
happening for a couple of years but

301
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,120
eventually at some point the market does

302
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,759
it what it does it does its job

303
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,350
and the weaker players are going to

304
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,000
start dropping out and the stronger

305
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:52,500
players are going to start consolidating

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,840
and that curve is going to level out and

307
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,940
then it's going to start dropping and it

308
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,330
may go down as deeply as it went up and

309
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:04,420
we'll eventually level out so what does

310
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:06,850
that mean for us what what does life in

311
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:09,549
the bell curve mean it's really

312
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,590
important that we consider this and one

313
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:14,709
of the things that it means is that the

314
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:18,540
first ones now may later be last

315
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:21,490
the person who today is your employee

316
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:26,379
may well in a few years be your employer

317
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:28,210
or your investor or vice versa none of

318
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:32,529
us really know how this horse race is

319
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:33,778
going to turn out so let's be kind and

320
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:37,198
gentle with

321
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:39,179
each other let's seek out the human

322
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:42,899
qualities that we really love and

323
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:45,929
appreciate in one another let's build

324
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:48,179
real relationships that are enduring

325
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:52,078
enough to carry us through whatever

326
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:55,049
turbulence these times bring us we are

327
00:15:52,078 --> 00:16:03,948
all brought together by this plan okay

328
00:15:55,049 --> 00:16:06,539
we are all one people so what is very

329
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:07,889
told you what it meant massive change

330
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:09,240
massive change okay so we're seeing all

331
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:11,818
this massive change all over the place

332
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,889
new entrants new laws new strategies new

333
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:15,419
capital and new tactics we're seeing

334
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,730
increasing numbers of general

335
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:20,610
practitioners who are recommending

336
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:23,089
cannabis not cannabis Doc's but GPS

337
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:26,100
right because there's this increasing

338
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:28,069
acceptance of cannabis in the mainstream

339
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,990
you've got so guys like Sanjay Gupta

340
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:33,088
saying that it's that it's okay and

341
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,610
we're seeing the creation of more

342
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:38,939
standard forms of cannabis therapeutics

343
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:41,789
more capsules more tinctures right and

344
00:16:38,938 --> 00:16:43,980
and and that in turn is encouraging even

345
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:47,159
more GPS to to write recommendations

346
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,808
which in turn is creating demand for

347
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:51,350
more of these products right so it's

348
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:54,149
very beneficial loop that's going on and

349
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,259
now we can look ahead to the - that just

350
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:57,328
has some really fascinating

351
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:59,430
conversations just like 20 20 minutes

352
00:16:57,328 --> 00:17:01,588
ago about this I mean we are now coming

353
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:04,198
to the day where instead of just working

354
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:06,209
with THC and CBD and one or two other

355
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,459
cannabinoids we're gonna start pulling

356
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:10,140
out all of the many cannabinoids that

357
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,230
there are in the plan okay we've looked

358
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,339
at maybe 15 out of 450 okay that

359
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,610
treasure chest

360
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:20,279
that treasure chest is opening up and

361
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:23,698
and we see other stuff right that that's

362
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:27,328
pushing us forward other innovation new

363
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:31,519
cannabis formats products like vape pens

364
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:34,558
and beverages and transdermal patches

365
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,389
more socially acceptable forms of

366
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:40,079
ingesting cannabis than sucking on a

367
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:43,288
bong or rolling up a joint and those new

368
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,658
formats are bringing in even more new

369
00:17:43,288 --> 00:17:46,519
adopters ever

370
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:48,470
we see more and more people who are

371
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,808
willing to consider cannabis because it

372
00:17:48,470 --> 00:18:00,139
doesn't look like the stereotype that

373
00:17:50,808 --> 00:18:02,928
they had in their head national brands

374
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:04,939
okay we now have National cannabis

375
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,409
brands that are like known across the

376
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:10,129
country

377
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:10,999
well institutional finance is not going

378
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:13,459
to be far behind

379
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:16,669
I can hear their footsteps in the

380
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:20,210
hallway already okay

381
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:24,019
and and and when they come there's going

382
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:26,749
to be a wave of really big acquisitions

383
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:29,028
and rich access exits for cannabis

384
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:32,538
companies that have been smart that have

385
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:34,148
played their cards right and I mean you

386
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:37,009
can already see it right look at

387
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:41,418
horticulture where Scott's miracle-gro

388
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:43,848
just bought general hydro okay next

389
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:45,470
quite possibly probably I think are

390
00:18:43,848 --> 00:18:48,339
going to be cannabis companies focused

391
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:51,710
on the science and medicine of cannabis

392
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:55,158
analytical laboratories extraction

393
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:58,278
technologies geneticists right because

394
00:18:55,159 --> 00:19:00,200
we will see rescheduling or D scheduling

395
00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:03,679
and when that happens it will kick off a

396
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,450
wave of pharmaceutical Rd and those

397
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,879
pharmaceutical companies are going to

398
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:12,019
want to acquire the research the data

399
00:19:07,878 --> 00:19:14,329
the techniques the team the brand of

400
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:15,950
these companies that have been focusing

401
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:21,339
on cannabis for a while so that they can

402
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:24,759
get first to market advantage and then I

403
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:27,288
know then after that maybe we see

404
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:29,149
cannabis beverage and food companies

405
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:31,878
that have developed a lot of traction

406
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:34,398
and brand equity in the market being

407
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:37,368
acquired by large corporations that have

408
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:38,868
already existing footprints in in food

409
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:41,058
production and beverage production

410
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:43,069
distribution and they're basically

411
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:46,989
perfectly positioned to just add

412
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:46,989
cannabis to their list of ingredients

413
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:57,120
so that's what's gonna happen there will

414
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,370
be more waves like that that come and

415
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:02,619
what we're seeing is the first signs of

416
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:05,589
what's going to be a monumental

417
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:10,918
collision between the world of cannabis

418
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:10,918
and the world of corporations that

419
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:19,148
collision is going to be wrenching it's

420
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:23,589
going to be jarring it's going to be

421
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:26,648
shocking like all collisions are but

422
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:30,069
really if we take a moment and we think

423
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:33,099
about it that collision has been

424
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:35,548
inevitable ever since we started working

425
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:39,158
on legalization all of those years ago

426
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:42,398
because nothing nothing in the United

427
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,139
States of America is mainstream until

428
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:46,359
it's in the mainstream of Commerce and

429
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:48,459
so taking this plant into the mainstream

430
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:51,609
of Commerce which is controlled by the

431
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:56,619
world of corporations has to be it has

432
00:20:51,609 --> 00:21:00,329
to be a part of our job and I say that

433
00:20:56,618 --> 00:21:03,519
to you as a legacy cannabis person

434
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:05,378
there's some of my very dearest friends

435
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,940
in this world people whose children I

436
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:08,769
was there to see their birth and watch

437
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:12,548
them grow up and have children of their

438
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:17,740
own are going to be really seriously

439
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:20,829
hurt in this collision some of the

440
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,628
people who some of the people who are

441
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:24,579
most responsible for bringing us to the

442
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:29,528
state that we are here today this good

443
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:32,220
day that we're at ok so I want to take a

444
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:36,638
moment to speak directly to those of you

445
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:39,819
who like me carried this plan so

446
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:44,368
faithfully for so long through so many

447
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:44,368
years of the darkness of prohibition

448
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:52,269
around 50 years ago probably by some

449
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,389
divine stroke of Providence this plant

450
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:59,829
fell into the hands of our people and we

451
00:21:55,388 --> 00:22:03,158
opened our arms and we embraced her

452
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:08,868
we gave her a home

453
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:16,249
we nurtured her we protected her we

454
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:17,720
watched her grow we defended her against

455
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:23,509
the people that would have ended her

456
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:27,769
existence and we fought ferociously for

457
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:31,339
a long time for her liberation and it

458
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:34,220
has not been easy it hasn't been easy

459
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:37,009
we have been made sacrifices there have

460
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,659
been all kinds of sacrifices by many

461
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:40,788
many people over a period of many years

462
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:43,909
the most painful kinds of sacrifices

463
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:47,829
that human beings really can make we've

464
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:50,629
had violent raids on homes properties

465
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:53,178
seized our cars and our bank accounts

466
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:56,259
taken away even our children yanked away

467
00:22:53,179 --> 00:23:00,830
from their mothers arms

468
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:05,710
we've been arrested and jailed and

469
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:12,678
subject to extraordinarily long business

470
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:16,940
terms sometimes people have even lost

471
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:20,899
their lives but we still gladly welcomed

472
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:26,570
cannabis into our homes and into our

473
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:29,898
lives and over time she came to feel

474
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:34,398
like like one of ours like like one of

475
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:36,768
our family members and so in those years

476
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:41,508
it's only been natural for us to develop

477
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:45,319
a sense of possessiveness a sense that

478
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:47,659
this plant should in some way belong to

479
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:54,618
those of us who have loved her so well

480
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:58,369
and sacrificed so much on her behalf but

481
00:23:54,618 --> 00:24:00,528
we need to remember it's hard sometimes

482
00:23:58,368 --> 00:24:02,538
you know these thoughts I feel them

483
00:24:00,528 --> 00:24:05,538
almost every day sometimes multiple

484
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:08,888
times a day right who are these people

485
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:13,250
this is our thing what are they doing

486
00:24:08,888 --> 00:24:16,009
and we have to remember what we really

487
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,409
in our hearts to be true right which is

488
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:23,179
that no creation of nature belongs to

489
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:27,230
any human being we know this and so this

490
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:34,210
plan no matter how much we love her does

491
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:39,440
not belong to us we are not her owners

492
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:43,850
we are her stewards we are her

493
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,038
caregivers we are her protectors but she

494
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:49,069
didn't come into our hands so that we

495
00:24:46,038 --> 00:25:03,259
could become rich she came into our

496
00:24:49,069 --> 00:25:05,480
hands to help us change the world so all

497
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:07,548
my brothers and sisters they're okay and

498
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,048
I'm talking to the dreadlock warriors

499
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,849
I'm talking to the rainbow

500
00:25:09,048 --> 00:25:12,740
revolutionaries I'm talking to the

501
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:16,089
radical fairies I'm talking to the wise

502
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,950
earth mothers you all know who you are

503
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:22,730
we're going to be called upon to make

504
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:25,038
one more final sacrifice we are being

505
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:28,730
called upon now okay and that's going to

506
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:32,329
be to let this little sprout that we

507
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:36,409
have tended and with such care to grow

508
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:39,408
up and claim her real destiny to be able

509
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:43,150
to reach out all around the world and

510
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:45,440
come into the hands in a legal way of

511
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,380
everybody on this beautiful planet

512
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,970
because we know that the promise of

513
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,190
cannabis belongs to every human being

514
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:59,120
because every single last one of us has

515
00:25:52,190 --> 00:26:02,600
an endocannabinoid system so we can't do

516
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:04,729
that alone hey our arms aren't long

517
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:08,750
enough and there's not enough of us to

518
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:10,909
do that we need help and and fortunately

519
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,490
that help is coming and it's coming in

520
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:15,200
the form of new comers who are coming

521
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:19,759
into our industry and so we need to

522
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:24,169
welcome them and we need to help them

523
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:31,909
if we don't we're never going to finish

524
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:35,509
this job but I also want to talk to the

525
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:37,129
newcomers those of you who have come to

526
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:42,370
the movement come to the industry after

527
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:42,369
a lot of the heavy lifting has been done

528
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:53,959
so some respect appreciate the decades

529
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:58,658
of struggle and sacrifice that it has

530
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:03,579
taken us to come to this day understand

531
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:07,759
that for many of us this isn't just a

532
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:12,138
living or a way to build wealth or a

533
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:17,839
product or even an innovation cannabis

534
00:27:12,138 --> 00:27:24,888
is our teacher and our guide and in some

535
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:28,220
cases our sacrament who don't write off

536
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:29,808
the legacy cannabis industry we know

537
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,700
this plant and the culture that we have

538
00:27:29,808 --> 00:27:34,849
built around it better than the very

539
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:37,639
best of Wall Street analysts we're the

540
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:42,189
best subject matter experts that you

541
00:27:37,638 --> 00:27:42,189
will ever find anywhere

542
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:52,019
okay so we got this collision happening

543
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,940
right and obviously it's like I said it

544
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:58,740
is gonna be shocking and it will be

545
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:01,500
painful okay and it is happening okay so

546
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,630
what's the key to turning all of this to

547
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,210
something that has value and meaning and

548
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:09,060
purpose and is consistent with our love

549
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:12,120
for this plant okay I think what we need

550
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:14,159
to make absolutely certain of is that

551
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,929
cannabis changes the world of

552
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:21,950
corporations more than corporations

553
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:26,509
change the world of cannabis this plant

554
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:30,480
has been doing just fine for millennia

555
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:32,549
giving sustenance and healing to human

556
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,220
beings and doing nothing to harm the

557
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:37,769
rest of nature but corporate culture has

558
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,620
taken us to the brink of planetary

559
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:41,879
extinction in just a few centuries it's

560
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:43,799
only been a few centuries we've had

561
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,890
these things called score per a shion's

562
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:48,329
okay and look where we are so we need to

563
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:52,380
make absolutely certain that we can

564
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:54,449
advise corporate corporate that we

565
00:28:52,380 --> 00:29:01,380
cannabis corporations more than

566
00:28:54,450 --> 00:29:04,710
corporations corporatized cannabis so

567
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:07,410
big goal big goal big dreams for dreamer

568
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,750
dude they told me that 40 years ago too

569
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:13,310
you know and I'll tell you why I'm

570
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:15,799
hopeful a couple of reasons I'm hopeful

571
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:18,359
about achieving that goal one of them is

572
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:20,339
the many conversations that I have with

573
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:22,169
people who have just come into this

574
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:25,079
industry from the straight corporate

575
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:27,300
world and over and over and over again

576
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:30,750
they're like Steve it's so different

577
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:32,369
here you know I don't have to put a mask

578
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,500
on in the morning I don't have to hide

579
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:36,839
Who I am and what I care about during

580
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,809
the day my life has a meaning and

581
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,849
purpose people are more tolerant of me

582
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:44,009
and and my quirks and and they're

583
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:47,939
they're more forgiving they're more

584
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:51,480
caring I enjoy my life more and when I

585
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:54,180
look at them I know it's true right I

586
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,130
can see it in their eyes I can see it in

587
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:59,190
the lift in their step I can see it in

588
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,970
the smile in their faces and so why why

589
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,500
is that

590
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:04,200
think that that one of the reasons is

591
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,539
the inherent properties of this plan

592
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:12,350
right its ability to to spark creativity

593
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:17,730
and to extend patience and to inspire

594
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:20,639
togetherness amongst people and that's

595
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:23,490
that's not going to stop happening and

596
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,410
another reason another reason I have

597
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,000
hope is because our industry is

598
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:29,460
different it's different in a lot of

599
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,349
ways the product that that that we work

600
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,170
with is one of those big differences but

601
00:30:31,349 --> 00:30:35,809
another is that this is an industry that

602
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:39,630
grew out of a social justice movement

603
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:42,119
it's a very strange dynamic think about

604
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:44,730
it how many industries have grown out of

605
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:49,019
a social justice movement so the people

606
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:51,569
who created this thing we weren't people

607
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:54,349
who cared about creating wealth so much

608
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:57,859
as we cared about changing the world

609
00:30:54,349 --> 00:31:01,169
when we started this thing 50 years ago

610
00:30:57,859 --> 00:31:04,229
we didn't know that cannabis feature

611
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:08,190
cancer or prevent Alzheimer's or help

612
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:10,410
epileptic kids okay all we knew was that

613
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,509
when we smoked this plant when we smoked

614
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,759
this flower it helped us become more

615
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:17,879
like the people that we really wanted to

616
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:20,819
be and so we've tried to carry that

617
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,290
sensibility into the organizations and

618
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:24,529
into the businesses that we've built

619
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:28,980
we've tried to infuse that sensibility

620
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:31,950
into the entire culture to to use what

621
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:35,039
we're building as a vehicle for social

622
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:38,880
change as a way to create this new way

623
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,799
of life that we're all looking forward

624
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,080
to I mean I think everybody is looking

625
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,019
forward to it right it's like do we

626
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:47,759
really need to create just another new

627
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:49,559
industry like every other global

628
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:53,160
industry out there do we need more of

629
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:54,980
them no okay we need a new kind of

630
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,850
industry that's going to unleash

631
00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:01,470
transformational change that's going to

632
00:31:56,849 --> 00:32:05,459
break the corporate mold and we can do

633
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:07,950
that right there's going to be a lot of

634
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,420
wealth and fabulous careers that are

635
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,009
going to happen in this industry and

636
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,170
many of the people who enjoy those

637
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:15,720
benefits are in this room today

638
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:18,870
but if all that we have to show for

639
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,250
ourselves at the end of the day 20 or 30

640
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:22,829
years from now when we look over our

641
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:26,190
shoulders are those riches will have

642
00:32:22,829 --> 00:32:30,359
blown the most valuable opportunity

643
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:34,769
that's in front of us okay and that's to

644
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:40,709
create this new kind of industry the

645
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:45,059
future is in our hands it's a blank

646
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:46,500
slate we're starting this really from

647
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:48,599
the beginning we're still just in the

648
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:51,269
beginning the revolution has just begun

649
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:56,639
okay and what this thing is going to

650
00:32:51,269 --> 00:33:00,869
become is in all of our hands so let's

651
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,240
make sure that what we create that the

652
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:05,579
world that we leave to our children is

653
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:10,349
the world that takes the lessons the

654
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:14,399
cannabis teaches us seriously okay and

655
00:33:10,349 --> 00:33:20,339
what is what does that mean okay that

656
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:22,560
means a world where leaders are no

657
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:26,250
longer so ostentatious and they're held

658
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:31,220
more to account a world where gender

659
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:34,589
roles are more fluid a world where

660
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:37,170
bottom line calculations always include

661
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:40,500
returns to communities and workers a

662
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:46,980
world where sustainability is a basic

663
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:49,980
threshold of all new ventures where

664
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:53,339
people are kinder and gentler to each

665
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:55,740
other where disputes or solved

666
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:58,289
peacefully more peacefully more often

667
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,329
and where parents spend more time

668
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:02,819
playing with their kids where couples

669
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:06,029
spend more intimate moments with each

670
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:08,639
other where violence of all kinds drops

671
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:10,829
and where we finally have a place an

672
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,599
honored place in our society for all of

673
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:15,719
the flavors of human beings that we are

674
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:18,089
blessed with okay that's the future of

675
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:20,159
cannabis okay that's the future of

676
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,690
cannabis that's what we can really

677
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,428
achieve some people say Steve you're

678
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:25,530
playing the long game yes I am playing

679
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:27,568
the long game okay that's the future

680
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,450
that I want and that's the

681
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:33,179
that is in our hands that's what we can

682
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:35,668
achieve if we really take the lessons

683
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:38,220
that this plant teaches us seriously if

684
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:40,679
we really demand of ourselves that we

685
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:42,388
become the people that we really want to

686
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,099
be this is an amazing chance and we

687
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:46,108
should take it okay I don't think that

688
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:48,750
we can afford to blow this opportunity

689
00:34:46,108 --> 00:34:50,699
this greatest opportunity that any of us

690
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:54,000
will have in our lives because look

691
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:55,128
around at the world today look at what

692
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,768
we're dealing with

693
00:34:55,128 --> 00:35:00,739
we're created technology that's on the

694
00:34:58,768 --> 00:35:05,129
verge of cooking this planet into an

695
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:06,808
uninhabitable cinder every time I turn

696
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,269
on the news and I see what's happening I

697
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:11,220
hear about more people blowing

698
00:35:09,268 --> 00:35:13,739
themselves up more people are killing

699
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:14,568
each other for the most ridiculous of

700
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:19,108
reasons

701
00:35:14,568 --> 00:35:21,929
so is there ever a time has there ever

702
00:35:19,108 --> 00:35:24,538
been time that this plant that the

703
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:27,179
wisdom that this plant teaches is more

704
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:29,369
in need by the world I don't think so

705
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:33,449
okay I don't think it's going too far to

706
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:35,700
suggest the future and the fate of our

707
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:38,639
world could depend on the future of

708
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:41,009
cannabis so let's all get this job done

709
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,420
let's win on November 7 and look forward

710
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:45,740
to partying with you that night

711
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,740
throughout the coming year
