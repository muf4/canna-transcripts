1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,369
I still think you're gonna see a huge

2
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,278
reduction initially in cultivars that

3
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:19,049
are in the system because primarily

4
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:20,850
nobody really holds the same number of

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,289
different types of varietals and

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,810
produces the number of different

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,090
varietals as a craft culture does so a

8
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:28,848
craft culture and it's rounded

9
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:32,130
development of cannabis production

10
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:34,890
you'll have big swaths of it moving into

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,510
commercial realm but the people hold

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,980
their own libraries of things they think

13
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:39,570
of trendy and things that they like

14
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:43,729
historically and things that work for

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:47,250
them specifically and so that population

16
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:49,500
the majority of those people probably 95

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,890
percent of them total don't have a

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,659
permit so it doesn't allow them to work

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,189
with that population a plant anymore

20
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:57,869
because those people can't enter the new

21
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,549
system unless they take their plants and

22
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:02,308
have somebody in the nursery license it

23
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:04,140
and start to work those directions in

24
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,489
and even then that's difficult because

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,810
there's tracking the money as it goes

26
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:12,270
through so how do you pay and ultimately

27
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,920
it'll be whatever's in the hands of the

28
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,109
people who have the permits right now

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,299
and we have a an intake period just like

30
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,590
Washington did we will take plants in

31
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,360
over two-week period that's our

32
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,549
inception point we log every single

33
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,670
plant we ran in the building we roll the

34
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,829
seed stock we log all the genetic and

35
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,990
that begins our whole path for the

36
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:33,149
future and from that we're supposed to

37
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:35,250
work it out as we go forward but no new

38
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,040
stuff to just enter the system unless

39
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,989
you're getting it from some other legal

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,390
entity where you can then say yes I

41
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:44,280
bought this plant from this place with

42
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,840
its tracking number that's why the

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,310
tracking numbers around the plants not

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,680
so much that the people who buy legal

45
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,810
plants when you're at a store by July 1

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,899
and you came to a legal cannabis store

47
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,969
you wouldn't be able to get a tray of

48
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,390
plants anymore you can get six total

49
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:02,339
just six and each one of those has a tag

50
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,530
on it that identifies that that's a

51
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,810
unique plant and so when you're when

52
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,219
you're talking about a tray of clones

53
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,229
which you couldn't buy unless you had a

54
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,359
permit

55
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,880
that'll be one single tag for the whole

56
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,890
hundreds so a trade plunge is called a

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,568
lot so say we have two trades we have 50

58
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:20,399
in each one but we call 100 back so we

59
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:24,299
can even have three trades in the 33

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,560
well close we call it a 99 lot but the

61
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,510
bottom because it's they're gonna count

62
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,819
so you can't even like screw this one up

63
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:31,679
every single plant has to be trapped in

64
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,599
this component so they're doing it as a

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,950
hundred count but if you start having

66
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,870
plants missing they want to know where

67
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:40,019
they went to in the tracking system and

68
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,090
so regular people that have no permits

69
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,969
just regular cannabis growers consumers

70
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,250
can come into the store and then right

71
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:49,560
now they can still buy with their 215

72
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,319
they can still buy legal what they can

73
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,650
get in their hands but after July 1 it

74
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,799
is 6 plants period per person per day I

75
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,000
don't they and I don't even know that

76
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,469
they have they're having issues now in

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,050
other states where they're having the

78
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:05,819
law enforcement teams come in and make

79
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,040
repeated purchases through the day and

80
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,019
they arrested all the budtender so one

81
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,489
of the most successful shops in Colorado

82
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,900
and a very great well if you like be

83
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,129
like what we use like say Brittany

84
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,560
patients group is an example something

85
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:18,840
that's big and established imagine if

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,420
they came in and you sold someone in

87
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,030
ounce a couple times in the same day

88
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:26,578
only an ounce each transaction but they

89
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,110
came back multiple times well not even

90
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:29,310
to the same person every time it was

91
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,440
just different tenders

92
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,239
well they arrested 14 of them and gave

93
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,709
them felony drug trafficking charges so

94
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,360
it's in Denver are one of the big scene

95
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,129
of a big major Colorado cities so I

96
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,400
tripped out because it was it was it was

97
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:43,349
a it's an interpretation of how they are

98
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,560
gonna serve on these type of situations

99
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:49,349
and so ultimately for dispensaries to be

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,930
careful you know they or storefronts now

101
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:54,120
you sell the six to the individual and

102
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,030
that's all they could take with them but

103
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,610
if I wanted as a as a farm to be able to

104
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,009
buy this or meaning as like a nursery to

105
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,350
buy I could go to a dispensary buy six

106
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,659
from a dispensary and then take it to my

107
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:08,340
storefront and enter it legally into my

108
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:11,250
system I think we could long as we can

109
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,049
track this movement of plant material so

110
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,020
plants could still make it through in

111
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:15,879
the fashion but

112
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,620
it's gonna be really tough and for most

113
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:19,689
people if they get caught with anything

114
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,980
your neighbor doesn't like in they say

115
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:22,120
hey you got the plants in the backyard

116
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,490
in the cops visit you and they make you

117
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,220
cut down anything but six well lo and

118
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,389
behold the the other 22 you had with the

119
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,470
ones you've been holding on to that

120
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:32,439
really allows you to have genetic

121
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:35,080
differentiation and so no matter what

122
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:37,420
it's gonna be hard to get the same

123
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:39,639
amount of varieties to this to the buyer

124
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,470
that they're used to because you're not

125
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,659
gonna have half the people I bet maybe

126
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,640
90% of ninety-five percent of the oil

127
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,460
blowers I talk to I'm gonna be permitted

128
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,379
either because everybody's blowing oil

129
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:52,029
and I got a spot but I'm like but you're

130
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:55,449
do you have a state permit for that and

131
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:57,729
no and and so it's it's kind of weird

132
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,620
because there's like a quasi belief that

133
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,000
you're permitted because you're doing

134
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,009
something illegally and no one's

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,800
arresting you but that doesn't mean

136
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:07,240
you're permitted and in a second it

137
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,520
doesn't make a difference what you

138
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,889
believe if you don't have a number it

139
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,529
can't be bought to a store we can't do

140
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,419
anything with it as a farmer if I don't

141
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:18,399
have a tag on the plant that matches I

142
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,050
can't give it to the lab I can't give it

143
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,849
to the distributor I can't give it to

144
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:24,310
the the processor I can't give it to

145
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,350
this it has to track in a linear fashion

146
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,480
and so you're gonna have it when

147
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,800
radically compressed group of genetics

148
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,030
and I know I mean I know some guys get

149
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,160
they got some plants and doing their

150
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:35,439
thing but there's no way that the big

151
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,350
operations even if they diversified an

152
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,120
acre at a time would equal the number of

153
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,860
little producers in the state of

154
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,930
California that used to produce cannabis

155
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,460
we're talking every neighborhood in

156
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,350
California had people grown out of

157
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:50,589
garages and a lot of doing damn good job

158
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,390
growing some really nice cannabis but in

159
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:54,669
different varieties because the

160
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:57,219
dispensaries took it from them and so

161
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,920
they provided just those four or five

162
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,160
pounds per run of whatever it was they

163
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,230
did but there was

164
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,780
tens of thousands of them you know and

165
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,270
so how can any any conglomerate compete

166
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:09,500
with that sheer quantity people so I

167
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:11,779
believe you're gonna get a radically

168
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,290
neck-down amount of strains and

169
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:17,359
availability initially until the they

170
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,250
can then start to multiply what they

171
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,080
want to do from there I'm going to urge

172
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:31,389
the markets

173
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:31,389
