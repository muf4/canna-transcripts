1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,519
so we're the founders of nose botanicals

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,349
and we founded our company on a set of

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,299
core values so the first thing we did is

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:12,629
we incorporated as a benefit corporation

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,880
so that we can never be forced by a

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,310
Board of Directors or some situation

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,460
like that to change any of our core

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:22,919
principles which is you know to focus on

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,439
the sustainability of the ingredients

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:32,009
and the packaging as soon as it's

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:35,280
possible to him child resistance it's a

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,670
highlight sustainability but ultimately

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,730
to actually use what we're doing with

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,100
our products with our company to create

15
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:47,128
real change in the agricultural space

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,410
because when you integrate a lot of the

17
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:51,030
botanical ingredients that we grow into

18
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,640
us into a conventional agriculture

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,948
system like on a hemp farm on a cannabis

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,149
farm you not only increase the health of

21
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:02,519
the plot you also build soil you attract

22
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,239
beneficial insects that fight off

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,770
credits or that fight off you know

24
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,099
insects that per day on your plants and

25
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:12,390
then you increase the value of your crop

26
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:13,798
because now you're not just pulling

27
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,859
cannabis or hemp out of it you're

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,880
pulling calendula extract extract these

29
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:23,640
can be a high-value essential oils and

30
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:27,329
at the end of the day if we can create a

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,930
very high value high price tag end-user

32
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:33,569
product that supports systems of

33
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:38,520
regenerative agriculture that's the

34
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:41,849
ultimate goal definitely I can't I can't

35
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:45,780
really say it any better I mean being

36
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:48,298
able to make doing good work profitable

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,599
has been one of the things that have

38
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,090
made me stick in this fight that we can

39
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,849
actually do good works and actually earn

40
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,630
a living doing it is really something

41
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:02,938
that that sparks my heart that we can

42
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:04,890
move it forward and I have to say glad I

43
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:07,649
found a partner that actually believes

44
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,330
in that ideal because

45
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:13,030
it's out here on the struggle we beans

46
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:16,890
arise more than a few tips just make it

47
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:19,300
to trying to make it ends me and so

48
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:22,989
slowly but surely kind of feel like that

49
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,730
cat hanging in there until this industry

50
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,250
settles down and can actually be an

51
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:30,129
adult industry where it functions like

52
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,490
regular businesses rather than this

53
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:35,829
little fledge in the industry that has

54
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:40,360
regulatory hurdles that cause problems

55
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:42,510
for us to stay in business but I have to

56
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,400
say a shout out for my friends that are

57
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:47,709
developing vertically integrated silos

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,539
their own cooperatives farms

59
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:54,070
manufacturers distribution centers we

60
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:57,519
need to start building our own

61
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:59,289
vertically integrated silos proper to

62
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,890
living amongst ourselves you know

63
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:05,439
something like a blue diamond almond or

64
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:07,869
Ocean Spray as far as like getting a lot

65
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,620
of small farmers to be competitive

66
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,580
against these large large large

67
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,150
conglomerates that are coming after our

68
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:19,330
lunch we built this industry we we

69
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,640
should not be allowing people that just

70
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,380
can capitalize baked the cake they're

71
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,949
eating it

72
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:28,359
yeah we're taking our cake back and

73
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:31,419
we're we're willing to work with anybody

74
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,769
who wants to work collaborate with us if

75
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,389
you want to be competitive then

76
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,110
hopefully we'll see in the rearview

77
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:37,029
mirror

78
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,250
you know collaborative works moving for

79
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,219
helping the planet helping our fellow

80
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,590
man building up you know equitable pay

81
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:46,930
you know for people that work in the

82
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:50,379
trimming industry and these uh we're

83
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,959
trying to make that possible and big

84
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:55,509
industry just wants to turn it into a

85
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,560
you know cash cow and that means you

86
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:58,989
know the people that work in those

87
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,689
communities are gonna be undercut rather

88
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,939
than

89
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:03,530
the good high-paying job it used to be

90
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:07,189
in these communities we want to keep it

91
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,449
that way that hey and over the last 12

92
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:10,069
months that's really been something we

93
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:14,329
cared about a lot so when we were on

94
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:16,009
stage accepting our award last year it

95
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,889
was like every person who came up to

96
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:21,409
take their award gave their acceptance

97
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:23,449
speech followed by their retirement

98
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,220
speech it was like thank you for this

99
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:28,189
wonderful award it's a great thing to go

100
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:31,520
out on piece it's like wait ever you're

101
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:35,120
all giving up and so by the time we got

102
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:39,199
up there it was like you know maybe if

103
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,819
we all work together we're all here so

104
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,529
we've actually spent the last 12 months

105
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:47,509
doing something very very non businessÃ­

106
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:49,189
and very counterintuitive we've been

107
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:52,969
actively giving a hand up to our

108
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:54,709
competitors whenever we find them if I

109
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,870
if I run into one of my competitors and

110
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:58,819
they need a manufacturing space they

111
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,449
need a connection to a distributor they

112
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:04,459
need a connection to a lab or a piece of

113
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:07,699
inventory source material

114
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:09,919
I always always there bro definitely

115
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:13,219
corporate corporate carpetbaggers

116
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,629
them but you could be my bro and be my

117
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,630
competitor and I will help you out

118
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:20,089
because you're here you're part of the

119
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:23,180
real industry and I'd rather work with

120
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:26,089
someone who I have to compete with in

121
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,100
the market if they're real because at

122
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:31,669
least we're establishing what the market

123
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:36,120
is that that true core what the markets

124
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:38,310
supposed to be oh gosh

125
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,819
I think it was Churchill that said we

126
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:45,149
can either hang together or fall apart

127
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:47,730
and that's not seriously what we need to

128
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:49,620
do we need to build and work together or

129
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:53,069
we're gonna fall apart they're gonna

130
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,590
take take us and I ain't down for that

131
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:57,719
and there's still enough market space

132
00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:00,418
left for all of us little guys to have

133
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,250
our brands out there we don't have to

134
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:07,409
compete with each other we do have to

135
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:10,620
compete with overly capitalized low

136
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,780
value products that are just kind of

137
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:18,360
being pumped out there to steal market

138
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:21,989
share ultimately I think we're seeing in

139
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,419
general in the world that that market

140
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,560
tactic is not gonna fly anymore people

141
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:30,269
want good and we will never

142
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,978
equivocate on that point we will always

143
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:33,978
make the best product that we can

144
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,980
