1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:10,888
so I have this Sheldon black downstem

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,660
piece that has all these little holes in

3
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:20,368
it so if you listen to the sounds see

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,350
how loud it is and the water kind of

5
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:34,759
sprays up into my mouth but then when

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:34,759
you put this thing on suddenly

7
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:52,920
yeah it's much more gentle so anyway we

8
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:55,259
have some raised cannabis some ice cream

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:01,920
cake that John and Larry gave me up and

10
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:08,280
humble a few weeks ago anyway so we got

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:13,250
some raised cannabis and I'm gonna bring

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:18,478
back do you remember the ember from

13
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:20,069
around 2012 I think it came out we're

14
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,859
actually talking about bringing this

15
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:26,158
back to the market but with some

16
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:29,640
upgraded functionalities so first thing

17
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:35,670
is it only has one temperature which is

18
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:42,719
really fucking hot let's wait for it to

19
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:45,978
heat up more in soon yeah I can feel so

20
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,978
anyway instead of using a lighter

21
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,699
normal people keep taking all my

22
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:57,939
lighters but anyway instead of a lighter

23
00:01:52,700 --> 00:02:01,960
with I'm sure Bix uses the finest butane

24
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:06,368
yeah so you can see that heating out so

25
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:06,368
all right so let's try this thing with

26
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:28,849
nice that works and then just gonna try

27
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:43,040
it with some let's do some hash we have

28
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:55,219
some Cali hash here together oh yeah

29
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:57,048
that thing only lasts 90 seconds okay so

30
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:59,799
it's probably way too high for this and

31
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:59,799
I think that's one of the

32
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,590
anyway

33
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:27,109
of course we got the glove in there the

34
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:30,889
cool thing is that you don't even really

35
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:33,770
have to clean this the stuff wipes or it

36
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:39,349
comes right off but anyway so this has a

37
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:43,100
ceramic tip currently only has one

38
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:47,060
temperature so what I'd like to hear is

39
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:48,650
some ideas for various temperature

40
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,759
settings that you'd like to see if

41
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:55,189
you're dabbing with it or your personal

42
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:59,709
preferences and then other features and

43
00:03:55,189 --> 00:04:03,889
functionality what I think as a an

44
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:06,070
ergonomic replacement for a lighter oh

45
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:09,409
and so it has this little protective top

46
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,750
so now it's yeah so even if it's hot you

47
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:16,279
can put I think this has aluminum in it

48
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:18,798
so it's not gonna burn anything and this

49
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,509
thing also turns off after 90 seconds so

50
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,839
if you get super high and pass it on the

51
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:27,620
couches it's not gonna be on for as you

52
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:31,779
knock it over with your feet anyway

53
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:38,060
that's the ember and then we have the

54
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:44,750
Sheldon black holes in the bottom of the

55
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:46,459
stem actually you know let's see how

56
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,430
fast you want to take another hit and

57
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:52,599
you're like oh my god

58
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,600
let's light you back up

59
00:04:53,769 --> 00:05:03,529
and here it goes you're the jeopardy

60
00:04:57,468 --> 00:05:08,500
music so anyway I hit the Kali hash and

61
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:08,500
I hit the flower

62
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:21,539
[Music]

63
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:29,889
yeah so I have two of these so I'm gonna

64
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:32,558
play around with them and but yeah

65
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:36,788
looking for feedback on what you would

66
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:41,409
like in a little ceramic tip besides

67
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:46,658
super long battery life nice ergonomic

68
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:50,740
design and variable temperature settings

69
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:54,658
so anyway I know gotta go pick up my

70
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,658
daughter at preschool so
