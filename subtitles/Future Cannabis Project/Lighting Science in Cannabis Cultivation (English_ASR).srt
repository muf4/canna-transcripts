1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,200
so when we talk about environmental

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:06,089
control and how it controls or impacts

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,009
the growth or the quality of the plant

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,269
we're talking about managing and

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:11,039
controlling the environmental parameters

6
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,120
that are important to how a plant grows

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:17,339
so with regard to light plants respond

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,980
to light in two ways one is through

9
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:22,100
growth which is biomass accumulation and

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,630
weight and yield and the others through

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,118
morphology photo morphological affects

12
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:28,320
meaning that the spectrum of light or

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,390
the type of light you're providing to

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,399
the plants influences the size and the

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,929
shape of the plant and so those two

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,420
things can be complementary to each

17
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:38,670
other with regard to yield overall as

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,859
well as quality but sometimes they're

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,500
not complimentary and the way I like to

20
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,689
analyze that or make that make an

21
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,530
analogy about that is to think about

22
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:48,238
economy

23
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,510
whenever I have conversations with

24
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:54,000
growers I always tend to lean toward a

25
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,378
conversation about economics and when

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,899
you think about what a plant is a plant

27
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:59,759
is a really a factory it's receiving

28
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,530
energy in the form of light it's

29
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,570
converting that light energy into

30
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,519
chemical energy through the process of

31
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,379
photosynthesis and then through a lot of

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,618
other downstream at a lot metabolic

33
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:13,228
processes it is creating the the

34
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,969
molecules that make up the plant some of

35
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:16,978
those are the structural molecules the

36
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:21,269
stems and the leaves others are the

37
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:24,688
chemical the other chemical molecules

38
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:26,069
that we grow cannabis plants for so when

39
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:30,029
you're talking about it from an economic

40
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:31,319
perspective as the plant is using carbon

41
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,969
that it's absorbing out of the air

42
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,978
through these processes of these

43
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:37,019
different metabolic processes of fixing

44
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:40,109
that carbon that carbon can either be

45
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,489
turned into a stem a root a leaf cell or

46
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:43,469
it can be turned into a cannabinoid

47
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,929
molecule or could be turned into a

48
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:48,090
terpene so those two things could be

49
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,570
competing with each other in terms of

50
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,899
the economics of carbon in the plant

51
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,769
tell me about the cannabis plant and its

52
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:58,259
relationship with light at different

53
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:01,019
stages of growth there are a number of

54
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,899
people who advocate manipulating the

55
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:06,149
spectral environment over their cannabis

56
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,818
crops to try to elicit various responses

57
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,038
and it's very challenging to measure and

58
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,619
quantify that because of the variability

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,359
of not only the genetics of the plant

60
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,450
but the environment that they're growing

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,909
in as well as the analytics it takes to

62
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:24,238
measure those types of responses so it

63
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:25,560
makes it very difficult to to verify and

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,840
validate that those types of

65
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,430
environmental influences on the plant

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,680
are causing the results that they are

67
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:36,180
intended to result in so one some of

68
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,060
those types of spectral manipulations

69
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,450
are to modify the spectral environment

70
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,870
for different phases of growth and it's

71
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:48,018
I believe part of it is as a legacy

72
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,519
issue where people have grown different

73
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,989
phases of the plant growth under

74
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,760
different types of lights which have

75
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,289
different types of spectrum so they

76
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,929
would advocate for a blue rich

77
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:59,519
environment in the veg phase which would

78
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,140
make um from a fluorescent light or a

79
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,209
metal halide light versus the less blue

80
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:07,289
rich spectrum for flowering such as

81
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,949
you'd get in a high-pressure sodium

82
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:13,560
light one thing that a lot of people

83
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:16,108
don't realize is that all of the

84
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,409
electric lighting technologies including

85
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:21,989
LED technology were never developed for

86
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:24,629
growing plants they were only developed

87
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,269
for human lighting applications it just

88
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:29,400
so happens that humans and plants see

89
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,799
the same wavelengths of light when I say

90
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,900
see I mean they both are sensitive to

91
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,290
the same wavelength range of life but

92
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,909
they see that light very differently so

93
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:42,989
humans use that wavelength range of

94
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:45,810
light for visual you know to see for

95
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,459
visual purposes plants use it for energy

96
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:52,199
that's their energy source for growing

97
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:54,598
and so plants absorb all wavelengths of

98
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,160
light in the range in that same range so

99
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:57,810
all wavelengths of light are useful to

100
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,650
the plant and drive in photosynthesis

101
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,750
okay I always hear like 400 to 700 so

102
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,199
yeah can you talk about is there any

103
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:11,489
research into the light outside that

104
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:14,549
respect like zero to 400 and 700 plus so

105
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,009
plants use the wavelength ranges between

106
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,519
400 nanometers and 700 nanometers and

107
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:22,978
that's essentially what humans can see -

108
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,750
but plants also absorb light outside of

109
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:27,060
those ranges and typically that like

110
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,519
those those wavelengths of light

111
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,319
are used for signaling in the plants so

112
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,639
on the lower end of the the

113
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,668
photosynthetically active radiation

114
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,240
range below 400 nanometers which is in

115
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:42,120
the near UV to UV range that can have

116
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,810
certain responses on plants typically

117
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,230
it's an environmental stress response

118
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:50,639
plants can respond to that in a way that

119
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,889
would protect themselves from that type

120
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,199
of so you should the plant saying this

121
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:58,590
is not normal something wrong is going

122
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,599
on I need to protect myself maybe like

123
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:02,519
have a thicker layer on the leaves yes

124
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,770
it's not necessarily that they would

125
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,299
perceive it as not normal but what they

126
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:08,668
would perceive it as is it's an

127
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,069
environmental influence that the plant

128
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:13,049
has a response to and so if they're

129
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:17,759
exposed to that environmental influence

130
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:19,910
meaning a UV photon then it has a

131
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,969
response to that you feed UV photon

132
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:27,540
plants are amazing living things because

133
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,940
they are they can't move so they have to

134
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,780
endure a very wide range of

135
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:35,639
environmental conditions and and as such

136
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:36,809
they've evolved many different ways to

137
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,509
deal with those different types of

138
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,220
environmental influences so if a plant

139
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,409
were growing at very high elevation and

140
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,090
exposed to a lot of UV they would

141
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,340
produce chemicals that would protect

142
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:48,929
them from UV damage to them just like we

143
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,449
put on sunscreen when you go to the

144
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,459
beach plants create their own sunscreen

145
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:55,110
when they're exposed to UV radiation and

146
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:58,379
sometimes that's in the form of

147
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,720
molecules that can be similar to if not

148
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,788
the same as the types of compounds were

149
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,260
growing cannabis plants for to improve

150
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:09,750
the quality weight so sometimes the end

151
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,209
result could be a good desired result

152
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,250
yes but when you think about the carbon

153
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:16,888
economy of the plant if the plant has to

154
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,538
put on a thicker layer of wax on the

155
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,819
leaves to protect itself from UV

156
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:22,589
radiation that's carbon that goes into

157
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:24,719
that protective layer that's not being

158
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:27,179
used to make cannabinoids or terpenes

159
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,020
for example okay how about the other end

160
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,090
so above

161
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:35,680
sure so so above 700 nanometers is

162
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:38,138
far-red radiation and that does also

163
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,939
have an influence on plants it tends to

164
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,639
be given a lot more importance in the

165
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:45,310
cannabis culture in cannabis cultivation

166
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,930
than it really deserves because far red

167
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,759
light is associated with phytochrome

168
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,709
responses in plants and that's

169
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,610
associated with flowering and so people

170
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:56,318
would like to correlate far red light

171
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,389
with flowering and cannabis plants when

172
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,840
the reality is it's the photo period of

173
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:06,069
light that's triggering that that

174
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:07,508
reproductive they're triggering that

175
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:08,919
reproductive response in the plant

176
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,139
through the photo period and not

177
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:13,589
necessarily spectrum it in the real

178
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:17,439
world meaning in an outdoor environment

179
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:19,209
is there more red light in the fall than

180
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,250
let's say like is there more blue light

181
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:22,810
in the spring and red light is because I

182
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,430
I know I understand that people have

183
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,769
these perceptions is it kind of coming

184
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,319
from what they're seeing visually yeah

185
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:33,718
it's it there is seasonal differences in

186
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:36,218
the spectrum but it really is very minor

187
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:37,598
typically where you see the changes in

188
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:39,509
the spectrum and the sunlight is that

189
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,860
sunrise and sunset or dusk and dawn

190
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:43,389
because of the angle of the Sun and its

191
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,139
penetration of light through the

192
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:48,879
atmosphere changes the spectrum but the

193
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:50,348
majority of photons the plants receive

194
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,209
or during the day and that spectrum

195
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:54,339
doesn't change much at all if you look

196
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:57,459
at the past 10 years of light science

197
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:58,810
research as it relates to plants what

198
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:01,568
were some of the sort of the most grant

199
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:04,329
like in your mind most groundbreaking

200
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:07,479
discoveries in terms of like aha this

201
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:10,240
has we've discovered what this does to

202
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:15,430
plants here's one that's pretty relevant

203
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:18,310
to this industry is years ago people

204
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,650
were using LEDs to grow plants and

205
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,598
people have been growing plants for at

206
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:24,939
least 25 years using LEDs that's when I

207
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:29,978
first started with my research at NASA

208
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:32,229
and we focused on using wavelengths of

209
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:33,968
light that matched the absorption

210
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:36,849
profile of chlorophyll a and B which

211
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:39,969
means you used it was blue and red so

212
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:42,490
mixing blue and red LEDs together was

213
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,879
producing a spectrum that was absorbed

214
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,120
by

215
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:49,000
chlorophyll molecules now the problem

216
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,860
with that is that those measurements or

217
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,529
at least that chemical or that

218
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,659
absorption profile for chlorophyll was

219
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:57,220
from isolated chlorophyll out of leaves

220
00:08:55,659 --> 00:09:01,629
and measured in a test tube in a

221
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,730
spectrophotometer and that produced a

222
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:05,529
graph that showed that chlorophyll a and

223
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,440
B absorb light and the blue and red

224
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:10,329
range now that led people to think that

225
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,490
plants only need red and blue light and

226
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,920
that's we note that today that's not

227
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:18,009
true but it's led to a lot of technology

228
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:19,750
development for LEDs specifically with

229
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:21,220
red and blue LEDs and it's a the

230
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,950
combination of the two is a purple

231
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,830
spectrum which is not superior to a

232
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:29,440
broad spectrum in any way but it still

233
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,450
works it will grow plants as long as the

234
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,100
light levels are maintained at the same

235
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,770
as the broad spectrum you would expect

236
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,350
the same types of yield and same types

237
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:40,509
of responses from the plant

238
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,580
however there's a human factor issue

239
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:45,939
associated with a purple spectrum it's

240
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,250
very difficult to detect problems with

241
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,280
your plants if your responsibility is to

242
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:53,490
make sure your your production facility

243
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:58,179
is running well and you need to look for

244
00:09:53,490 --> 00:10:00,490
powdery mildew or insects or nutrient

245
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:03,069
deficiencies it's very difficult to see

246
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,690
those under a purple spectrum so the

247
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,050
broad spectrum you literally when you

248
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:10,140
open those doors and walk in yeah so the

249
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:12,399
broad spectrum provides a superior

250
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:14,230
spectrum not only for the plants but

251
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,279
also for the people that are working in

252
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:20,440
that environment you have like the spot

253
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:22,360
level of light right and then you have

254
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,360
like the accumulation over a period of a

255
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,220
day yeah so can you talk about what each

256
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,310
of those are called and then like how

257
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,680
much how much sort of at one point in

258
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:35,199
time during the plant's various growth

259
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:37,959
stages you want and then what the

260
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
overall for like a day sure is that

261
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,680
you'd want yeah

262
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,839
so when we when we talk about light

263
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,579
measurement or light levels on on the

264
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,379
canopy we're talking about an

265
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,810
instantaneous measurement of light and

266
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:52,029
that's used with a quantum sensor and it

267
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:53,979
measures light between 400 and 700

268
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:55,299
nanometers it doesn't distinguish

269
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,190
between any of the different wavelengths

270
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:58,259
of light

271
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,600
tells you how much light that plants

272
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:03,000
absorb are hitting your canopy it's an

273
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,620
instantaneous measurement

274
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
there's also another very important

275
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,769
measurement for light and that's the

276
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,690
accumulated light dose that the plants

277
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,629
received and that's term called daily

278
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,940
light integral or DLI and that is

279
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:17,399
basically the instantaneous measurement

280
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,400
of light times time and so it gives you

281
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,529
a daily amount or a daily dose of light

282
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,569
that the plants receive and that's very

283
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:26,519
important because when you're talking

284
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,500
about a photo periodic plant like

285
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,600
cannabis that flowers under short days

286
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,669
and states vegetative under long days

287
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,860
it's very important to manage those

288
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:36,449
types of instantaneous light levels and

289
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,669
the duration of time that they're

290
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:41,460
receiving in order to maintain a healthy

291
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:43,799
plant under those different reproductive

292
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,960
stages of growth and development so

293
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,029
given that what are some of the things

294
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,910
you've seen when you walk into a grow

295
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:52,889
operation where they're either giving

296
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:55,230
way too much or too little and what the

297
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:57,360
effect is on the plant's growth and

298
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,840
health well what I will address though

299
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,190
is how you can use DLI to solve or

300
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,740
mitigate some of the problems people

301
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:07,800
have going from vegetation to flowering

302
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:11,759
phase so if you if you're focusing on

303
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:13,829
DLI as a measurement or as a parameter

304
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:17,189
of your grow facility you can have a

305
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:19,440
similar DLI in veg that you do in

306
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,810
flowering and what that does has a very

307
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,560
practical implication because it allows

308
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:27,359
you to mitigate the light stress that a

309
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,449
lot of growers observe when they go from

310
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,690
veg to flowering if they veg under very

311
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:36,660
low lights light levels then they are

312
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,010
they have a lower DLI when they when

313
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:39,509
they move those plants into the

314
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:41,819
flowering phase and they have a much

315
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:44,100
higher instantaneous light level under a

316
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,110
shorter photo period the overall doses

317
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,659
of light that the plants receive is much

318
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,700
higher therefore the plants have to

319
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:53,549
acclimate to that higher amount of light

320
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,259
they're receiving and the the immediate

321
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:58,799
response that the plants have is they

322
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:01,080
observe a stress response to light it

323
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,088
hurt that's too much light the plants

324
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,460
cannot handle that much light and the

325
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:07,530
new growth has to be when the new growth

326
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,150
is produced it is then acclimated to

327
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:11,740
those higher levels of

328
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:13,509
growers often have to dim the lights or

329
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,519
turn some of some of their lights off or

330
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,740
raise the lights to mitigate that light

331
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,990
stress during that transition period but

332
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,539
if you manage the alive it's feasible to

333
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,430
mitigate that light stress period by
