in the cannabis industry how you got

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,868

14
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,700
president of community development for

15
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,979
flow kana flow kana is a cannabis

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,109
distribution company up in the Emerald

17
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:49,259
triangle that works with a network of

18
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:52,100
small sustainable Sun grown farmers and

19
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:55,229
does a distribution across the state

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,750
packaging and promotion for the Sun

21
00:00:55,229 --> 00:01:00,448
grown in sustainable methods related to

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,570
cannabis cultivation I've been working

23
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:06,269
with the cannabis people for over 20

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,879
years my background is a social worker

25
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:11,129
and public health researcher and I

26
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,399
started doing work with the dispensaries

27
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:17,489
in San Francisco back in the early 2000s

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,200
and really starting to study how these

29
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:21,179
facilities were operating as health

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,368
service providers and what they were

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,618
doing in terms of being really good

32
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:28,019
community health partners which is so

33
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,719
interesting because the conversation now

34
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:33,118
in light of The Cove advice around

35
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,670
cannabis has really been patient access

36
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,319
and it's interesting to see the

37
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,478
discussion around cannabis kind of

38
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,188
returned to that more medical framework

39
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:42,868
which is what it was like when I first

40
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:45,209
started studying it you know it was

41
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:48,390
really all about how do we get access

42
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:51,179
for people who are sick to a product

43
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,728
that is currently illegal and so I

44
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,890
really studied how patients were

45
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:58,019
accessing cannabis but also their

46
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,750
behaviors around cannabis so

47
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:02,699
specifically looking at how the use of

48
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,750
cannabis impacted their use of other

49
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,729
substances most specifically opiates so

50
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,378
I really was interested in looking at

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,750
that framework because nobody was

52
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:15,459
studying it back in 2002 2003

53
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,500
there was very little known about who

54
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,629
patients were or why they were doing

55
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,370
what they did so I continued studying

56
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:25,419
that and looking at that from a public

57
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:27,610
health perspective through 2012 and

58
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:29,949
that's when I went to work for the drug

59
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,320
policy Alliance as their manager of

60
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:34,089
marijuana law and policy really starting

61
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,370
to get more involved on the policy end

62
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,530
as legalization started taking off as a

63
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,580
policy change around the country

64
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:46,030
starting with Colorado so then in 2016 I

65
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,870
worked on Prop 64 here in California to

66
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:53,110
legalize cannabis which was a very very

67
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,840
preliminary step to the shift of moving

68
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,550
cannabis out of the illicit market out

69
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,129
of the criminal justice system and

70
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,170
moving it more into the field of Public

71
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:05,409
Health alternative health and medicine

72
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:07,869
so legalization being that very very

73
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:10,120
initial step to start moving cannabis

74
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,150
away from criminal justice after we

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,430
passed prop 64 in California I decided

76
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,400
that what my role really should be next

77
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,290
is to be boots on the ground and trying

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,049
to ensure that the system that we were

79
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,849
going to create after legalization was a

80
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:29,379
system that was going to be supportive

81
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:30,489
of smaller entities and of methods that

82
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:32,769
were going to be environmentally

83
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,140
friendly I didn't see a reason to

84
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:37,330
unleash a whole new industry onto the

85
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:39,789
world that was going to rely on energy

86
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,830
intensive cultivation methods and that

87
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:43,359
was not going to look at this through

88
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,329
the lens of sustainability and climate

89
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,420
change so I came to work with Flo kana

90
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:51,430
and I moved from Oakland up to Mendocino

91
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:53,979
County in the Emerald triangle to really

92
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,530
focus on the promotion of sustainably

93
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:58,149
produced cannabis and to ensure that the

94
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,030
policies that followed after

95
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,549
legalization would help support those

96
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,069
smaller farmers so what I do now up in

97
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:08,890
Mendocino is a lot of non cannabis work

98
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,409
helping the greater community whether

99
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:13,899
that be farming communities nonprofits

100
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:16,899
healthcare communities better understand

101
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,209
how cannabis can be integrated into what

102
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,250
the work that they're doing to bring a

103
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,189
net benefit to the communities that they

104
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,490
serve that's great

105
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:29,910
a lot about

106
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:32,250
farming sustainably and sort of going

107
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,740
back to those smaller farmers can you

108
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,069
tell us how focus on the sustainability

109
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,750
and those small small farmers led you to

110
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:41,910
becoming engaged with Appalachia

111
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,949
and sort of what that means for these

112
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,069
small farmers in those communities you

113
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:49,050
also mentioned access for canvass

114
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,180
patients and so maybe if you can talk

115
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,240
about the dynamic between you know

116
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,840
maintaining those smaller markets

117
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,280
sustainability and then also on the

118
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,339
other side access is sort of what

119
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:01,408
happened industry as a whole

120
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:03,060
sure so you know one of the things that

121
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:05,819
we're looking to do in cannabis is to

122
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,490
differentiate right the consumer really

123
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,800
has no idea what quality means coming

124
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,569
out of an illicit marketplace in an

125
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,210
illicit marketplace you don't have a lot

126
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:17,430
of choice you basically have access to

127
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:19,500
what is available to you and at the same

128
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,050
time there isn't a lot of opportunity

129
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,478
for scientists and artisans and people

130
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,449
to have an open discussion about what

131
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,860
quality means so under prohibition you

132
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:33,990
know consumers started looking at

133
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:36,150
quality as orange hairs tight nugs you

134
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,610
know what does that really even mean in

135
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:40,228
the grander scheme of things the public

136
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,830
was also led to believe that a higher

137
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:46,288
THC percentage was indicative of quality

138
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:48,658
and that's really no surprise under

139
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:50,759
prohibition if I'm gonna take the risk

140
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:52,408
of going and buying a product on the

141
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,658
illicit market and engaging in a

142
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:56,668
criminal activity and I get that product

143
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:58,468
home and it doesn't give me the euphoric

144
00:05:56,668 --> 00:06:00,990
effect that I was looking for because

145
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:03,240
it's not high in THC its higher and some

146
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,310
other cannabinoid I'm gonna feel ripped

147
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,810
off I'm gonna feel like I didn't get

148
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,879
what I paid for that the risk wasn't

149
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,939
worth it and because of that through

150
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,829
prohibition cannabis started to be bred

151
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:16,019
for what people wanted to buy on the

152
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:18,180
street which was a higher THC cannabis

153
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,519
so one of the benefits of legalization

154
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,250
is that we get a chance to step back and

155
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:26,939
really start thinking about what makes a

156
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,500
quality cannabis product and I think for

157
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:30,839
the farmers up in the Emerald triangle

158
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,658
where I work who for a long time have

159
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:36,060
worked to develop genetics that were in

160
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:37,949
line with the terroir and where they

161
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,718
were growing because if you're growing

162
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:40,600
outdoors and you're growing in a

163
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:43,029
clandestine

164
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,350
method if you lose a whole year's crop

165
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:46,629
because you didn't pick the right

166
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,370
cultivar to go with the environment in

167
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:51,250
which you're trying to cultivate that's

168
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,620
it I mean there really was no plan B so

169
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,529
we saw a whole generation multiple

170
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,829
generations of artisanal farmers up in

171
00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:01,689
the Emerald triangle breeding to go with

172
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:04,359
the environment in which they were

173
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:06,009
producing cannabis and so now that

174
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,980
things are legal and we're looking to

175
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:11,079
establish an artisan marketplace it is

176
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,480
very important that we look to how other

177
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:16,149
products have been designated as

178
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,710
artisanal through four centuries and

179
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:21,239
that really brings us back to the

180
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:25,149
Appalachians program and looking at how

181
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,720
burgundy and Champaign and port were

182
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:30,819
protected by looking at the terroir and

183
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,190
the environment in which these products

184
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:35,889
were produced and making the designation

185
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:38,680
that certain products can only be deemed

186
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:41,680
with certain labels if they're part of

187
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,860
that terroir so it really fits it very

188
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,689
very well to cannabis given the

189
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,150
artisanal qualities that have been

190
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:51,189
developed through Prohibition you know

191
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:54,609
prohibition did give us something you

192
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:57,189
know it gave us this wide array of very

193
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,800
very specifically produced cultivars

194
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:01,540
that we may not have had if cannabis had

195
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,030
gone the way of conventional agriculture

196
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,850
from the very beginning so getting to

197
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:09,879
your question about access I think it's

198
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,950
less about access to an amount of

199
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,860
cannabis and more about access to a

200
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,779
certain type of cannabis so one of the

201
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,020
things that we see with this artisanal

202
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,769
cultivation are novel cannabinoids

203
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:23,139
cannabinoids that aren't being

204
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:25,599
mass-produced that are extremely

205
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:28,919
beneficial for certain therapeutic

206
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:32,320
reasons so an example I'll give is THC v

207
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:34,840
THC v is a novel cannabinoid that is not

208
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,390
found in many cultivars on the market it

209
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,340
is found in very high amounts in a

210
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:41,679
cultivar that is produced by emerald

211
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,950
spirit botanicals in Mendocino County

212
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:48,309
called pink boost goddess so that is a

213
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,530
very unique cultivar it is produced in a

214
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:52,869
small batch but it has a very high

215
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,459
therapeutic potential so you know

216
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,169
allowing these small arts

217
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,360
you know farmers to take advantage of

218
00:08:56,169 --> 00:09:00,969
their terroir and to produce these

219
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,570
cultivars that may not have broad

220
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,670
commercial appeal but a very specific

221
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:09,490
therapeutic potential I think is really

222
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:10,899
going to help patients you'd better meet

223
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,080
their needs and they could with this

224
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:16,779
kind of broad stroke blue dream 21

225
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,190
percent THC approach that we're seeing

226
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:22,689
more in the mass market place absolutely

227
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,360
no consistency between the term blue

228
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:28,690
dream between different areas different

229
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,350
jurisdictions exactly exactly so we're

230
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:34,450
looking at less like just Merlot which

231
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,690
can taste very different depending on

232
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:39,430
where it comes from and burgundy which

233
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,620
could only be called that if it's

234
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:44,919
produced in the birdie region of France

235
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:48,730
from these very specific vines in a very

236
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:50,019
specific type of site yeah and while

237
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,529
it's important for something like the

238
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:55,389
wine industry the buzz that you might

239
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:58,120
get from a burgundy versus a general

240
00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:00,100
Merlot may be similar but you have

241
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,659
different case and it sounds like for

242
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,610
the camp ministry you're talking about

243
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:06,399
really fundamentally different effects

244
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,899
and so potentially even a more important

245
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,819
concept in the cannabis industry because

246
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,590
you're talking about being able to

247
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,980
differentiate and consumer knowledge

248
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:16,629
around differentiated effects absolutely

249
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,350
and to that point you know when it comes

250
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:22,509
to how the product is produced I think

251
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,850
that we're talking more about that the

252
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:26,500
land and the terroir but when we're

253
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,610
talking about effect I think we're

254
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,120
talking about the difference between

255
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,580
like mezcal and Coors Light right and so

256
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,070
they're both alcohol but folks report

257
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:39,310
very different effects from hard liquor

258
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,960
her liquors with in hard liquors and so

259
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:43,389
that's something that I'm excited about

260
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,700
because I think that under Prohibition

261
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:47,740
the cannabis pain consuming community

262
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,740
had no way to take advantage of these

263
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:56,590
very specific differences between

264
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:59,350
cultivators absolutely use the word term

265
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,960
terroir a few times could you just let

266
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,659
us know in the audience can you let us

267
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,129
know what the definition of a terroir is

268
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:07,850
just I know it's a very sort of

269
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:10,649
complicated term that has

270
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,149
possibilities in there and then the sort

271
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:15,208
of the connection between the term

272
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:17,958
terroir and then sort of oh the overall

273
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:21,838
apple juice the term of Appalachians

274
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:23,938
sure so terroir basically refers to the

275
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,860
environment in which the product is

276
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:27,990
produced so we're talking about the soil

277
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,879
we're talking about the air we're

278
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,159
talking about the Sun the moon the water

279
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,170
basically the natural elements that come

280
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,629
into contact with that plant and the

281
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:39,088
belief is that the combination of those

282
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:41,730
elements in the place where that plant

283
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:44,339
is being produced can result in a very

284
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,470
different outcome for that plant than if

285
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,600
it was produced somewhere else and so

286
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,420
for example for talking about a cultivar

287
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,569
let's say like lemon tree if you grow

288
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,399
lemon tree on one side of the hill you

289
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:58,229
may get a very different effect that

290
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,089
outcome of the plant than if you grow it

291
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:04,079
on the other side of the hill just under

292
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:08,759
the Sun hits the soil the acidity of the

293
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:12,739
soil the wetness of the soil and so part

294
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:15,778
of the process of establishing is

295
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,209
determining where these terroir regions

296
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:20,490
are located and something that's really

297
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:22,469
interesting is that terroir doesn't

298
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,169
necessarily follow with political

299
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:28,500
boundaries of counties so you could have

300
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:31,769
an area of terroir that spans two or

301
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,299
three counties but still is considered

302
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:34,620
terroir and I think that's something

303
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,990
that's going to be really interesting as

304
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,028
we start this process of developing

305
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:41,938
Appalachians is to look and see how

306
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:45,659
terroir doesn't does not confer conform

307
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:47,938
to political county boundary lines and

308
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:50,039
so you know the land is really what

309
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:52,678
drives the terroir designation and

310
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:55,318
figuring out which Appalachians

311
00:12:52,678 --> 00:12:58,678
encompass not just terroir but the

312
00:12:55,318 --> 00:13:01,620
practices that come out of that terroir

313
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:04,110
for that community so if you have soil

314
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:07,019
that's extremely acidic then you may

315
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,659
have a community practice that involves

316
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:12,509
amending that soil through natural means

317
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:15,240
in order to establish a more hospitable

318
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:17,250
cultivation environment but everyone in

319
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,220
that terroir is engaging in that same

320
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,879
practice so it maintains the uniformity

321
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:26,809
of the plant

322
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:29,699
absolutely you mentioned sort of the

323
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:32,909
benefits to local communities into

324
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:36,058
farmers that are have spent you know the

325
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:38,009
last decades cultivating certain forms

326
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:40,499
of cultivars that maybe weren't as

327
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:41,999
attractive to the overall illicit market

328
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:43,740
because of this lack of knowledge for

329
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:46,139
the consumer could you tell us a little

330
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,149
bit about the potential effect that

331
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,970
Appalachians protection for certain

332
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:52,558
terms would have for those farmers for

333
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:56,129
those communities for the sustainability

334
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:59,039
of farming as a as an industry and as a

335
00:13:56,129 --> 00:14:00,528
means of someone's livelihood especially

336
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,730
coming from a company like flow Cana

337
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:04,350
that many of us here down in the Bay

338
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,509
Area of you has kind of a conduit to

339
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,889
those small farmers you know

340
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:10,409
representative a sort of a

341
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,879
conglomeration of those farmers can you

342
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:15,539
tell us what it means for the industry

343
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:17,579
itself well I think it means a lot from

344
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:20,278
both ends and I think that that's a

345
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:22,678
really important part to remember you

346
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,688
know from the production end it means a

347
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:27,269
lot because it allows the farmers to

348
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:29,278
better categorize and describe what

349
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:30,990
they're doing and know that that

350
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,749
description is going to be uniformly

351
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,240
accepted so you know folks are talking

352
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:39,209
about dry farming for example which is

353
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,879
using no additional water at all but

354
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:44,188
basically tapping into the watershed

355
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:46,889
that's already underneath the ground in

356
00:14:44,188 --> 00:14:49,818
it results in the most amazing tasting

357
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:53,459
cannabis similarly to dry farmed wine

358
00:14:49,818 --> 00:14:55,558
you really have you know retain a lot of

359
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:58,349
those terpenoids and flavonoids you're

360
00:14:55,558 --> 00:15:00,688
not adding water so folks that are able

361
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,449
to dry farm want to be able to talk

362
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:05,818
about that process and have it be

363
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:08,008
universally accepted and acknowledged of

364
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:10,409
what that means for the quality of their

365
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:13,409
product and that follows down the supply

366
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:16,139
chain so folks like flow Cana can market

367
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:17,990
that and use that in branding and then

368
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:20,249
the consumer at the other end

369
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,079
understands what that means because it's

370
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:24,778
a protected term that you could only use

371
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:27,178
if you're doing a very specific type of

372
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:28,678
farming and so they're able to go and

373
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:30,899
feel confident when they go into a

374
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:33,240
dispensary that if something says it's

375
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,190
dry farmed they're gonna get those

376
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,870
terpenes and flavonoids and though

377
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,270
impacts in the plant that they're

378
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:42,389
expecting given what we're telling them

379
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:45,240
dry farming does so it creates this kind

380
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:47,610
of reliability and validity all the way

381
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,580
through the supply chain so that allows

382
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,320
the artisanal farmers to more explicitly

383
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,440
and accurately talk about what they do

384
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,020
it allows us to more accurately an

385
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,510
explicitly market and brand what those

386
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:02,730
farmers have to offer and it allows the

387
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:05,159
consumer to more accurately and

388
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,259
explicitly get the product that they

389
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:09,870
want and to be able to make that choice

390
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:11,669
at the counter to say I'm gonna choose

391
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,129
the product that has had the least

392
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:16,529
impact on the environment from the

393
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:18,570
farmer that's taking the most care and

394
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:21,569
stewardship of their land and that's

395
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:23,850
producing this cultivar that I know is

396
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,510
not going to taste like this or look

397
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,159
like this

398
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:28,200
unless it was produced in that region

399
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,929
and that's the system that we're trying

400
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,360
to set up and look just like wine not

401
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:36,059
everybody's gonna be like I want the dry

402
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,190
farmed artisanal terroir cannabis

403
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:40,919
there's absolutely going to be room in

404
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:45,150
the marketplace for a more mass-produced

405
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:47,069
general product and that's ok and we

406
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:49,350
need it all right in order to have a

407
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:53,180
balanced market that has something for

408
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:56,040
everyone but establishing that artisanal

409
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:58,109
marketplace is what is gonna be very

410
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,649
important for the farmers that are

411
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,240
farming in 2,500 square feet of land or

412
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:05,069
5,000 square feet of land or who are

413
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,440
only doing sun-grown which means they're

414
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:09,179
getting one crop a year versus someone

415
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,100
that's growing in a large all season

416
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:14,160
greenhouse it is getting six crops a

417
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:16,619
year we have to develop a system for the

418
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,690
marketplace to hold up that small batch

419
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:23,189
crop as special unique and in demand

420
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:27,809
absolutely and so really we're talking

421
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:30,860
about to more easily differentiate the

422
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:33,000
market in some of those large producers

423
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:34,529
these greenhouses no matter whether

424
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,150
they're in Southern California in the

425
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:37,470
middle of a desert in Northern

426
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,690
California in the middle of Oakland

427
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,250
those products are generally coming out

428
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,890
fairly similar because they're able to

429
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,869
control all the environmental inputs and

430
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,120
you're you're basically saying that

431
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:48,719
those farmers that are toiling in the

432
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,329
soil

433
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,710
son that have these very specific inputs

434
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:54,960
that are very different from those large

435
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:58,079
greenhouses are those large warehouses

436
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,640
they're in or crows they should be be

437
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,538
able to have an easy way to

438
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,280
differentiate their product absolutely

439
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:08,250
and to talk about who they are as

440
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,139
farmers you know a lot of prohibition

441
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,909
the farmers were ignored right it was

442
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,860
like the cannabis just suddenly appeared

443
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:15,720
at the dispensary or appeared in the

444
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,579
dealer's hands or the sellers hands on

445
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,650
the street and I think that the

446
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:22,168
appellation program is going to be a

447
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,419
wonderful way too far for farmers to

448
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:26,159
finally get the recognition of the very

449
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:28,020
specific methods that they've been using

450
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,270
to limit their impact on the environment

451
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:32,908
and to produce a very unique high

452
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:34,650
quality product it's a very important

453
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:37,500
story it's something that lends itself

454
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,750
outside of cannabis farming into food

455
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,730
farming and we really hope that this

456
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,099
will help consumers start asking these

457
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,169
questions about their food and not just

458
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:48,259
their cannabis you know we don't see

459
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:51,630
this as being a silo of cannabis and

460
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:53,640
sustainability but rather a gateway to a

461
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:58,220
further discussion about sustainability

462
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,220
and artisanal II produced food products

463
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:03,329
the positives of the appellations

464
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,759
projects are there any aspects of this

465
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:09,269
that are sort of controversial we saw

466
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:12,089
the CDFA regs drops on February 20th I

467
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:13,829
believe have there been any points in

468
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:16,288
there or are they missing anything that

469
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:18,899
you think should be included in this

470
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,519
baseline well I think one of the big

471
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,580
discussions is going to be what is

472
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:26,579
terroir and I think within that

473
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:28,500
discussion one of the big points that

474
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:31,740
we're gonna have to have more discussion

475
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,980
on is the use of unamended natural soil

476
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,048
native soil you know there are folks who

477
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,870
have been growing in the ground but have

478
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:41,849
been amending those soils for decades

479
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:44,788
because of inhospitable growing

480
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:46,469
environments so now the question is does

481
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:49,230
that amendment preclude them from

482
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,779
claiming appellation designation does it

483
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,429
have to be the soils been untouched or

484
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:55,470
can we say there's a certain percentage

485
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:57,149
of native soil or if you've been

486
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,710
amending the soil but you've been using

487
00:19:57,148 --> 00:20:00,359
amendments that come from your

488
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,740
environment over a certain amount of

489
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:03,779
time does that now cow

490
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,130
what about people that grow in smart

491
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:06,779
pots are they going to have to go into

492
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,910
the soil in order to be considered an

493
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:11,759
appellation even if they're producing

494
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:13,350
under full Sun so I think that's one

495
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,089
discussion that's going to have to

496
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:17,129
happen and then the other is going to

497
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:19,169
have to be the difference between a

498
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,420
geographic indicator in an Appalachian

499
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,340
because you can definitely have

500
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,140
Geographic indicators that we do for

501
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:27,299
wine and if you're growing in an

502
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,160
all-season greenhouse in Oakland you can

503
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,629
still have a geographic indicator that

504
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,880
tells people that this product was

505
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,710
produced in Oakland not the same as an

506
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,330
appellation so I think there's gonna

507
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,720
have to be some discussion including

508
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:41,250
legal discussion about how we really

509
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,400
operationalize appellation versus

510
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,259
geographic indicator yeah and that's a

511
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,380
really good point because right in terms

512
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:51,869
of the consumer I live here in Oakland

513
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,850
in terms of the consumer being produced

514
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:56,819
in Oakland within opens borders and

515
00:20:53,849 --> 00:21:00,569
employing Oakland residents can be very

516
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:05,789
important to that consumer and you know

517
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:06,960
know exactly is there so last question

518
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:09,690
thank you so much for all those

519
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,819
information and last question is there

520
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,830
anything any sort of discussion any

521
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:16,500
person that you're really particularly

522
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:18,589
interested in hearing from at this April

523
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,759
2nd event that we're gonna hold online

524
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:23,399
any any sort of thing that you're

525
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:24,119
particularly excited about well all of

526
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,130
it

527
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,439
I have to say I'm so excited about the

528
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,910
lineup of speakers I've said a few times

529
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,670
I feel like it's getting the band back

530
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:34,080
together because you've really found a

531
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:36,420
lot of folks who've been doing this a

532
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,819
long time and I think that one of the

533
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:41,370
big pieces of value that all of us will

534
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:44,250
bring to the discussion is a recognition

535
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:45,989
and an observation of the evolution you

536
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,299
know none of us came into this yesterday

537
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,679
and I think on average the speakers have

538
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,869
probably been doing this for at least a

539
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,820
decade or more so I think that we've

540
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:56,039
really seen the evolution through

541
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:57,629
prohibition and legalization and can

542
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:01,019
really speak to that in the larger

543
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:04,679
context of the past 20 years rather than

544
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:07,079
just kind of since 2016 yeah no that's

545
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:09,090
we try to get that historical context

546
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:12,029
because especially in issues like this

547
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:14,189
they affect legacy markets small farmers

548
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:16,808
business you know that that

549
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,519
perspective and that perspective that

550
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:21,490
has some developments and evolution over

551
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:25,779
time so thank you so much for your time

552
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:27,759
this morning and we really look to see

553
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:30,069
you on April 2nd we can't wait to have

554
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,720
you and it's gonna be sort of a grand

555
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:33,369
experiment along with the rest of our

556
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,808
work from home last moment but we're

557
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:38,789
really excited to happen so thank you

558
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:38,789
again I look forward to it thanks
