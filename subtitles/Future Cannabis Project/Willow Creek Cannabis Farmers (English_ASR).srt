2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:16,640
to me Willow Creek is a pristine

3
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:20,939
environment and it has the perfect

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,480
climate for growing cannabis

5
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:27,060
Willow Creek is a community that has

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,460
been cultivating cannabis for decades

7
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:31,109
and generations Willow Creek is River

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:40,070
fun in the Mountain Sun

9
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:40,070

11
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,159
thank you

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,100
Willow Creek is different than other

13
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:58,320
growing climates in Humboldt because we

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,480
are at the foothills of the Kalamath

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,480
mountain range which holds one of the

16
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,539
most biodiverse forests in North America

17
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:10,019
so our Waters our air and our

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,719
environment is directly a result of our

19
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,099
position between the coast and the

20
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,658
Klamath mountain range and The Trinity

21
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,179
Alps

22
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,000
Humboldt in general to me is the Napa

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,618
Valley of cannabis this is where it all

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,118
started and I really feel like that

25
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:27,239
Willow Creek region the farmers here

26
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,219
really are putting all their love and

27
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:34,319
passion into what they're doing

28
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:36,658
we focus more on quality over quantity

29
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,839
to make sure we are producing and

30
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,820
providing the best quality product to

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,880
the end consumer

32
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:47,758
this is craft cannabis grown small scale

33
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,938
with the farmer in touch with every

34
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,280
plant every bud we're growing in clean

35
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:56,099
air with clean water

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,739
we grow our herb with the seasons and

37
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:03,000
with our property we don't try and push

38
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:07,319
too much on the boundaries of

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,118
lights and other environmental issues

40
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,060
that's really what it's all about for us

41
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,878
is is trying to uh

42
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,360
to bring that best product and make it

43
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,780
in the most environmentally friendly way

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:26,280
I think the community is really

45
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:29,280
empowered and energized and looking at

46
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,979
fun ways to help create a better place

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,680
for us all to be and have our kids in

48
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,959
and to experience life in

49
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,459
we actually minimize the ingredients

50
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,759
that we put in our cannabis to make sure

51
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,259
that we leave it as organic as possible

52
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,500
we use

53
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:49,560
natural organic fertilizers and only as

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,800
much as the plant needs we're not using

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,659
salts we're not over fertilizing

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,060
we should be trying to make the most

57
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,878
mindful choices possible so when we're

58
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,699
producing cannabis under sunlight it

59
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:05,459
takes a hundred years for this Farm to

60
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:07,859
produce the carbon impact of one ten

61
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,539
thousand square foot indoor cycle

62
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,720
between heating cooling and electric

63
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:15,000
costs the social responsibility I think

64
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,340
is you know it's in the hands of

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,620
consumers to really digest this

66
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,739
information and be able to make an

67
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:26,459
impactful choice for a climate

68
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:30,000
sun-grown cannabis is a completely

69
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,219
different product than industrial

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,439
Factory farmed cannabis

71
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:36,080
what we would hope is that people can

72
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:40,259
start to understand that they're a clear

73
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,360
climate Solutions and while it may seem

74
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:44,579
daunting every person has that

75
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,200
opportunity to make a difference with

76
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,060
how they purchase

77
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,878
if you put in some of your personal

78
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,459
values it's almost always a win-win when

79
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:57,560
you buy craft cannabis

80
00:03:53,459 --> 00:04:01,019
buying craft cannabis is supporting

81
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:04,920
communities it's supporting families

82
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:07,680
it's supporting the environment

83
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:10,738
so by choosing cannabis from the Willow

84
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,560
Creek region you get to experience a

85
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,319
little bit of the natural beauty and the

86
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,899
love of the community that went into

87
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:22,079
growing that flower for you

88
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,879
we eventually found this community here

89
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,540
in Humboldt and

90
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:29,879
it was an instant like oh These Are My

91
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,939
People this is my place

92
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:35,100
and you know a lot of that does have to

93
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:39,120
do with the Cannabis because it is just

94
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:43,080
a way of life here it's completely woven

95
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,379
through daily life and culture

96
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:50,099
just trying to embody

97
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:55,199
a more sustainable ecologically sound

98
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:57,120
way of farming and life

99
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,478
the Willow Creek Community is a really

100
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,000
resilient group of people who are deeply

101
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,039
committed to sharing Prosperity with

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,019
each other it's what I've experienced we

103
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,020
recently had a fire come close to the

104
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:12,359
property and the amount of community

105
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:14,418
support and outpour and a time of Crisis

106
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,300
and need really

107
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:20,279
you know shook me to a place of humility

108
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,079
and gratitude

109
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,239
yeah Willow Creek is a really strong

110
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,758
community

111
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:30,620
we are so supportive of each other

112
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,479
I feel like the community now is a fresh

113
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:37,100
younger

114
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,099
revitalized Awakening of Willow Creek

115
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,978
we're the farmers that put all of our

116
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,199
heart into it and so

117
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:46,620
support craft cannabis

118
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,038
it's our lifestyle it's what we do we

119
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,038
love it

120
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,000
foreign

121
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:09,560
from Humboldt it was made with love

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,560
I couldn't imagine doing anything else
