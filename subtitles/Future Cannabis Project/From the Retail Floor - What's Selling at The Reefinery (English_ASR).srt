2
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:16,170
majority of our vape selection we start

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:19,170
with things that do pods Suzy we have

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,170
the PAX era pods we have a wide

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,118
selection of select brand vapes here as

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:29,220
you can see they're extremely popular

7
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:31,618
for us as we keep going through we have

8
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:34,280
things such as our disposables and more

9
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,929
cartridges different various battery

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,020
attachments and then we do have more

11
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:42,899
concentrates things like live resin

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,270
sauces shatters what-have-you

13
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,280
we've also included a few of our infused

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,960
pre-rolls in there too to keep things

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,320
separated from the ones that are just

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,410
flour only as we keep going forward this

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,140
way we'll have our flour cases here so

18
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,698
this will be things anywhere from pre

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,509
rolls that are solely flour as we

20
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,859
discussed earlier to prepackaged eith

21
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:06,899
there actually are some brands that do

22
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:10,260
half-ounce prepackaged

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,478
things of that nature as we continue on

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,450
we do have our edibles here so we

25
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,250
started along here with our baked goods

26
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,960
we have some rice krispies some crackers

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,359
some cookies

28
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,459
we've also thrown in some juices in

29
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,349
there as well really great for the

30
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:29,009
summertime as it starts to get hot now

31
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:32,548
as we continue forward we move into our

32
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,188
chocolate always a fan favorite can't

33
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,259
get enough of that the tears and the

34
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,599
Kiva's and we've carried forever have

35
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,849
always been quite reliable but it seems

36
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,828
that nug is really making waves right

37
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,919
now really coming through with some high

38
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:49,438
quality chocolates then we move forward

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,549
onto gummy candies here

40
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:56,879
things like Green Hornet's Kona Kamino

41
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:59,280
district edibles at a pier etc some of

42
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,718
which are brand-new and really killing

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,780
it some people have been around for

44
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,390
years and still just seeming to break

45
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,649
through forever being popular in the

46
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,989
industry then we move forward to our CBD

47
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,318
line so we have a bunch of different

48
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,140
things

49
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:19,888
we have the select CBD products the pro

50
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:22,289
canna CBD products Popham berkeley these

51
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:25,459
are really gonna be staples for us as

52
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:27,900
the CBD becomes more and more popular

53
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:29,188
with the you know it could be the older

54
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,989
generation but even the younger

55
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:33,090
generation everybody seems to really be

56
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,739
wanting to that CBD effect where they're

57
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,049
not getting high throughout the day but

58
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,780
they really can have a level of you know

59
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:42,329
serenity and peace pain-free whatever it

60
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,919
is that they're using the CBD for you

61
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,750
know we also have things that are I

62
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,900
wouldn't say novelty but things like

63
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,609
bath bombs or CBD water things that are

64
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,620
just extra fun and a little bit

65
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:56,069
different we even have some CBD lip balm

66
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:06,090
CBD tea bags just different things out

67
00:02:56,068 --> 00:03:19,078
there that not everybody carries oh let

68
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:21,090
the Tok brand so there are some brands

69
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,459
that it's a lot easier to decide than

70
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,079
others um such like we like the plus

71
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,469
that one was this really simple one

72
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,599
because it it actually eliminated a need

73
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:32,579
to put them in the display case saving

74
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,098
us some room putting it on top so that

75
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,650
was more of a like saving space

76
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:40,289
situation same with the Sun say choose

77
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,329
the Ken doesn't they brought those over

78
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:43,828
where it says you know what do you want

79
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,930
to feel and it kind of gives more of an

80
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,310
explanation on their products the reason

81
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,438
for that one is because we have so many

82
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,419
questions about the products from ken

83
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:53,280
doesn't what is the calm do what is the

84
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,419
connect do what is the cruise do so that

85
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,829
gives them a second while they're

86
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:57,900
wandering around to really figure that

87
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,939
out without having to ask maybe they are

88
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,799
shy to ask them they don't want to to

89
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:03,090
seem stupid or whatever it is even

90
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,769
though there are no stupid questions

91
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,359
here you know you just never know so

92
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,889
that was kind of an easy one to fail

93
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,840
like yeah we should put that out there

94
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,259
and really help the customers figure

95
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,259
that one out

96
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,600
honey vape over there same as actually

97
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,129
those two same thing as the before with

98
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,530
the plus they're just saving space for

99
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:22,538
us our cases are kind of limited and we

100
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,489
have so much product so it was nice to

101
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:27,069
be able to put a couple of which on top

102
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,800
saving us some space inside so a lot of

103
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:31,870
brands fighting for not much space so

104
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,509
can you talk about the decision making

105
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,850
process so that really goes with what's

106
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:39,220
like I mean if you're already super

107
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,379
popular in your already you know helping

108
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,060
us out as far as you know we're selling

109
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:47,079
a lot of you then we're gonna give it a

110
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:51,269
little bit more space for sure someone

111
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:54,038
like nug their chocolates are definitely

112
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:55,569
really popular so we have all four of

113
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:57,610
them out on display even though we could

114
00:04:55,569 --> 00:05:00,009
probably just put one or something like

115
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,930
that I'm saying with the Select brand as

116
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:03,970
you saw earlier they take up quite a bit

117
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,129
of space in our baby case but they are

118
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,400
by far our most popular selling vape

119
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:10,779
brand right now we are yeah so our

120
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:12,459
customers can't seem to get enough of it

121
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:15,250
so I definitely think that that's

122
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:18,609
something that really helps you know get

123
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:21,639
us get you in there yeah what's new

124
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,710
what's trending what's declining so

125
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,060
trending 100% this I get you said that I

126
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:27,638
could the first thing that came to mind

127
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:31,389
was raw garden so those are right over

128
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:33,009
here we have not only the the sauces and

129
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:36,340
live resins but we also have the vape

130
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:38,288
live cartridges and I would say the

131
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:39,609
cartridges are more so trending right

132
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:41,469
now than anything because it's their

133
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:45,158
newer product even though they only have

134
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:47,710
two products out right now people come

135
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:49,658
everywhere looking for specific strains

136
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:50,799
like if they release a new strain and

137
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:52,389
then they put it on their Instagram

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,710
people will come here and be like do you

139
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:55,210
have that one I saw it on their

140
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:56,978
Instagram or you know I heard that

141
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:58,870
they're gonna be releasing full gram

142
00:05:56,978 --> 00:06:01,449
cartridges which is coming I think this

143
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,918
week um the second we heard about that

144
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:04,720
we could go ahead a made sure we got our

145
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:07,029
order in because people aren't come

146
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,030
specifically looking for that stuff the

147
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:12,129
social media thing is really doing it um

148
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:15,250
also as far as trending I would say plug

149
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:17,199
play that brand is really like making

150
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,430
waves and killing it right now something

151
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,468
that I didn't think that they would be

152
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,478
as popular when we first started

153
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:23,699
carrying them

154
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:26,938
so they're right over here plug play

155
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:29,699
they make its cartridges essentially but

156
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,860
they're using their own unique device so

157
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,499
kind of like the way that the PAX era or

158
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,930
the stays a bay had their own device

159
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:39,330
with their own little pod cartridges

160
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,158
the thing about plug play versus the

161
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:44,248
other brands is that their whole focus

162
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:47,579
is to be really strong like a DAB so you

163
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:49,110
get big hits big clouds and that sort of

164
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:51,209
thing but they taste great and people

165
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,629
are loving them so there have a very

166
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:56,758
limited menu just the pods and just the

167
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:59,099
battery and they don't have to too many

168
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,460
strains they have what's called the DNA

169
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:04,889
strains the daytime nighttime anytime or

170
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:06,329
they have yeah or they have the exotics

171
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:09,120
which are gonna be the fruity flavored

172
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:11,128
ones what's going on in the concentrated

173
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,379
space so in the concentrate space was

174
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:14,669
really popular well that's funny because

175
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:17,009
you and we were talking about what's

176
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,899
declining and so what's really declining

177
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:21,658
is you're not really seeing many people

178
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:23,189
asking for things like crumble or even

179
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:25,228
really shot or quite as much anymore

180
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:27,360
people are really looking for anything

181
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:30,209
that's gonna be super clean whether it

182
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,778
be live resin the you know distillate

183
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:35,668
syringes sauces but yeah those are more

184
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:37,319
popular for sure especially I would say

185
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:39,778
the sauces because they come with the

186
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,509
most flavor and you know you really get

187
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:44,338
a full spectrum high you get really you

188
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:49,649
know really good so people do appreciate

189
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:53,269
that yeah absolutely yeah absolutely I

190
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:55,918
would say that nowadays are gonna be

191
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:57,959
every once in a while you will get that

192
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:01,528
especially here because our demographic

193
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,999
isn't super young but yeah I would say

194
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:05,718
that we see that more than any other

195
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:08,699
shop but yeah it's not that likely

196
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:10,168
definitely though people are gonna feel

197
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,899
like they're becoming more connoisseurs

198
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:15,269
now with these high-end products coming

199
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:17,218
out because they don't want any of those

200
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:18,598
chemicals or things that they used to

201
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:21,748
people some people used to not care

202
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:23,550
about but as far as like terpenes go and

203
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:25,229
things like that the regular consumer is

204
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,728
far more knowledgeable than they used to

205
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:29,158
be and that's more so what they're

206
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:30,568
looking about is like the exotic strains

207
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,038
or something that tastes really good

208
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,800
versus that's something that's gonna get

209
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:37,318
them the most high so even

210
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,478
no you have an older demographic they

211
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:42,088
are coming in here saying I saw this on

212
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,219
Instagram beauty oh yeah absolutely

213
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:46,679
whether it be Instagram sometimes we've

214
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,600
maps or you know cuz there really isn't

215
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:50,519
a very much Facebook or anything like

216
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,290
that going on anymore Instagram seems to

217
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,318
be the head of social media currently

218
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:57,118
and yeah even with our demographic we're

219
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:58,678
still getting customers in here at that

220
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:01,350
point but you know I would say the

221
00:08:58,678 --> 00:09:03,688
majority of it is 35 and above so a lot

222
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,178
of the working class parents adults just

223
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:09,509
people not age really you know and those

224
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:13,078
people are super tech savvy so talk

225
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:15,499
about you talk about we mess like is it

226
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:18,058
a love-hate relationship is it

227
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:20,548
definitely things that you we love about

228
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:23,129
we'd maps because with Whedon Matt you

229
00:09:20,548 --> 00:09:25,198
know you very rarely get a first-time

230
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,548
customer who says that they found you

231
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:28,019
from something other than wheat mops

232
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:29,399
it's almost always gonna be that oh I

233
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,019
was in the area and I looked on weed

234
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,278
maps and you guys were there you know I

235
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,289
saw you guys when we messing you had a

236
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:35,698
coupon or you know you had the product

237
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:37,349
that I was looking for when I searched

238
00:09:35,698 --> 00:09:40,740
it into weed but you know weed maps is

239
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:43,048
always great for that type of thing but

240
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,068
you know there are some things that that

241
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:45,958
happened and I wouldn't say this

242
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:47,159
necessarily weed maps fault because you

243
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,798
know sometimes you'll want to get a

244
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:52,379
product verified on weed maps but that

245
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:54,208
would be on the other companies and you

246
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:55,709
put it in hoping to you know get a

247
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,479
pending request to get it verified

248
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,789
almost like a celebrity would on

249
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,490
Instagram and then they go ahead and

250
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:03,868
confirm yes we do supply that product in

251
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,209
that store and they will confirm and

252
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:09,298
verify it so the waiting game I would

253
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:10,948
say is a lot even so with the coupons

254
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:12,958
you know you put in the coupon and then

255
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:15,778
you gotta wait for weed maps to approve

256
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,729
it and so that can take anywhere from 24

257
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:19,860
to 72 hours so it's a lot of just a

258
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:23,200
waiting game situation but besides that

259
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,778
weed Maps is so helpful

260
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,399
yeah you don't you know there's a couple

261
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:29,049
things here and they're like they have

262
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,149
illegal shops on it that's always not

263
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:33,458
fun for us you know cuz we try so hard

264
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:38,528
to do everything we can to be by the

265
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:41,649
books we're you know you know I

266
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:44,110
personally have not I'm not sure if

267
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:45,759
upper management has but it's definitely

268
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,589
something that you know we're not

269
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,990
appreciative of Prijedor

270
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:52,870
you know we we like to keep it with only

271
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,269
legal shops on the site for sure

272
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,310
and how many like when you go and search

273
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:59,220
on weed Maps how many illegal shops do

274
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:01,689
you see and you're kind of well you know

275
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,449
go and spend a lot of time searching for

276
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,910
that to be totally fair but you know

277
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:09,698
there was one that we didn't notice pop

278
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:11,409
up the other day this store and we went

279
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:13,419
on weed maps and lo and behold there

280
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:17,698
they were so it was old you know it just

281
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:17,698
it always happens it is what it is

282
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,440
that's why that's why I totally is love

283
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,208
and hate cuz like I said you don't

284
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,430
really get first-time customers who said

285
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:29,948
that they found you any other way I have

286
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:32,198
a question about the more discriminating

287
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:34,719
user with concentrates does that

288
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:38,078
attitude translate over to flower are

289
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,750
people more discriminating about their

290
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,250
Wow oh yeah absolutely so it's and it's

291
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,289
gonna fall into the same category the

292
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,730
people who are you gonna be just as much

293
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,899
of quanis ors about their concentrate

294
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,389
they're gonna be the same way with their

295
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:50,889
flower and you see more of a split I

296
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:52,629
think with the flower than you do with

297
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:54,129
the concentrate and I think it's just

298
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,990
solely because concentrates right now

299
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:58,750
especially people like raw garden are

300
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,759
able to deliver high quality at a decent

301
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,320
price whereas with flower it's still

302
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,720
really scattered you know what I mean

303
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,430
we're still able to get you know we have

304
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,500
twenty dollar eight but they might not

305
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:10,929
be quite as great qualities are $40

306
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,230
eighths so there's still a little bit of

307
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:16,750
a barrier with that but yeah I would say

308
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,610
that definitely we have people super

309
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,139
knowledgeable when they you know they

310
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,000
come in usually knowing what they're

311
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:24,250
looking for they usually are asking to

312
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,230
see THC percentages and things like that

313
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,940
which is something that you know years

314
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,850
before it was unheard of people never

315
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,959
even understood let alone knew what they

316
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,639
were talking about when it came to

317
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,649
things like that so it is really an

318
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,899
to see how much the consumers knowledge

319
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:40,059
has evolved so then next obvious

320
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:42,370
question is is that as you're paying

321
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,109
attention in this it has to influence

322
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:50,470
your decision about what you're gonna

323
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:55,300
stop maybe like in the last year have

324
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:57,279
you well it's kind of hard because it

325
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:59,019
we're always trying to find the best

326
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,419
quality at the best price because

327
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:04,360
there's always the taxes to filter in as

328
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:06,099
well so customers will come in hoping to

329
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,470
get you know a $35 eighth and

330
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,540
occasionally they still are unaware of

331
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,759
the fact that you know $35 ace is gonna

332
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:14,409
bounce them up to whatever it is $48

333
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,689
something like that so you know it's

334
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:18,789
about finding that balance majority of

335
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,680
the time because I mean we have art like

336
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:23,049
I said our most expensive eights are $40

337
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:26,019
but we don't have quite so so many of

338
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:27,429
them because of the fact that with tax

339
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:31,179
they're already gonna come out to about

340
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:32,259
like 50 something dollars $56 so yeah at

341
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:34,239
the end of the day it's always about

342
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:38,379
finding the best possible stuff at the

343
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,360
best possible yeah we concentrate how

344
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:42,549
many people come in for brand specific

345
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,680
product they're seeking a specific brand

346
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:48,549
with with concentrates I think more so

347
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:51,789
than flower 100% because people are used

348
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:53,799
to the concentrate world being being

349
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,539
branded already from the beginning it

350
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,429
was already kind of a branded situation

351
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:59,139
where as the flower market was always

352
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:00,489
based off the Sun Street you know back

353
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,809
in the day it was just grabbing out of a

354
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,759
giant jar and putting it into a

355
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:05,409
container for you whereas now it's

356
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,399
you're going by brand and that's

357
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:11,019
something that they're not oh yeah

358
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,139
absolutely it's so much opportunity yeah

359
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:16,078
so get get back to flowers so what what

360
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:19,659
is your thinking

361
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:22,508
indoor-outdoor top shelf mids like what

362
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:24,759
what is your app you're kind of an

363
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:27,730
affluent neighborhood so what do they

364
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,470
consider top shelf so I mean at this at

365
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,239
this shop I like I said our most

366
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,600
expensive are the $40 and those are our

367
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:37,929
legacy a legacy strain eighths those

368
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,548
ones I yeah and those ones I love those

369
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:43,678
those are really great those ones are

370
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:43,678
definitely gonna be the top right now

371
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:51,239
this is not what you would say it's like

372
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:59,258
it's like it's creeping northward place

373
00:14:55,749 --> 00:15:00,790
yeah absolutely so I mean with that in

374
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:02,649
mind and I don't want to say they're the

375
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:04,838
top like they're the best stuff we have

376
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:07,149
it's just the most expensive definitely

377
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,949
at our highest price point the dank

378
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:12,970
republic our house brand those ones

379
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:15,308
range from $30 to $40 Nate so we have

380
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,230
all sorts of you know varieties whether

381
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:20,438
it be you know highest ones testing at

382
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:23,168
like 29% th theta down to I think we

383
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:25,238
have like a 17 or something like that

384
00:15:23,168 --> 00:15:26,588
but that's kind of our range there and

385
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:28,619
we try to keep it that way because like

386
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:30,669
I said everybody is becoming kind of a

387
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:32,499
connoisseur now so they're gonna come in

388
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:34,328
what's your highest testing th the air

389
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:35,889
can I see that what's the THC percentage

390
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:38,008
on that what's going on with it one day

391
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:39,818
was it packaged and you know very

392
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:42,009
meticulous about what they're looking

393
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:44,409
for for sure those ones you have I mean

394
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:46,778
they're all indoor with those ones we

395
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:49,058
also carry a bunch of the outdoor strain

396
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:51,909
or outdoor grown brands like flow Cana

397
00:15:49,058 --> 00:15:53,499
those ones are quite popular and those

398
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:56,019
ones are nice because they take from

399
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:57,909
different farms so people do like that

400
00:15:56,019 --> 00:16:01,209
because they are getting a variety even

401
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:02,618
if it's you know similar strains like

402
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,388
once we had a Sour Diesel wheels at a

403
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:06,160
super Sour Diesel but becomes they came

404
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:08,139
from different farms they were super

405
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,879
different strains that was really

406
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:12,278
exciting for a lot of our customers for

407
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,109
sure what else do we carry we have the

408
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:16,600
Emerald family farms those are another

409
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:19,089
nice outdoor one from up north people

410
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,629
really do enjoy those and they work with

411
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:24,100
their sister company loyal so those ones

412
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:26,110
another one that people really enjoy of

413
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,178
the outdoor come the outdoor ground and

414
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,750
those ones usually go from anywhere for

415
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:31,959
like 20

416
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,669
$1 $25 on the 8th so super

417
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,889
reasonably-priced is the pressure of

418
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:38,049
price pressure downward like oh it's

419
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:41,080
always down like the pressure dam like

420
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:42,370
people want yeah it seems like right now

421
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,590
that's really what people are looking

422
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,990
for and like I said I really think it's

423
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:48,430
because of the tax situation because you

424
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,560
know we have a lot of the time people

425
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:52,389
are trying to you know bulk up and get

426
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,000
as much as they can but you know and

427
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:57,009
then they hear that it's gonna be like

428
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,809
$300 or something like oh no let's kind

429
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:00,819
of take it back or let's find something

430
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,139
else that we can do instead or you know

431
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,059
but that's why we always like to offer

432
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:06,039
things like our deals here like with our

433
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:08,980
house for in the dank Republic brand we

434
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:10,659
do have a deal where we offer it's on a

435
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,539
board actually I believe eight eight

436
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,009
eight eighths to the price of six so

437
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:18,039
things like that we always try to offer

438
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:21,220
so they still can get quite a bit for a

439
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:24,909
better deal talk about now let's go from

440
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:27,430
the consumer side to the the back end

441
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,860
dealing with distributors and the people

442
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,720
who will sell you it seems like supply

443
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:37,449
is tightening up meaning there's less

444
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:39,519
flour passing testing which means less

445
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,860
concentrate less flour less everything

446
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:45,250
which means prices would logically go up

447
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:48,250
so are you seeing an uptick in the

448
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,769
prices that whether it's a flour brand

449
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,569
or a concentrate brand or edible brand

450
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:55,990
you know I'm actually really not too

451
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:59,619
much to be honest with you I'm you know

452
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:01,660
it's a really wide range of price points

453
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:03,239
whereas whether it be the prepackaged

454
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,769
bud which is normally what you're seeing

455
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,870
but to be honest with you I'm not seeing

456
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:13,150
an increase that much unless it's

457
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:14,619
somebody who is really like really was

458
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,210
it really popular in the market but

459
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:19,569
usually somebody who's like really

460
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,950
popular they stuff like I don't have a

461
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:21,970
good word for it is hype but you know

462
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,980
what I mean they're just getting a lot

463
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,970
of whether it be social media or

464
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,589
whatever it is they're just getting a

465
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,180
huge following so they feel that they

466
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:29,980
can put their price point up super high

467
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,980
that's you know they're worth it even if

468
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,390
it might not necessarily be yeah but I

469
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,680
really am not seeing too much of that

470
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,269
people are really trying to be

471
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:42,229
competitive right now

472
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:47,329
kill us Oh God I couldn't even tell you

473
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:49,190
I want to say 50 so that means they are

474
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:52,069
in competition with without another word

475
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:54,109
yeah so they're really I mean really

476
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:59,749
competitive prices I feel like more so

477
00:18:54,108 --> 00:19:00,978
than not it mm-hmm yeah I mean

478
00:18:59,749 --> 00:19:03,139
everyone's fighting for shelf space

479
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:07,399
unless they happen to get an exclusive

480
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:11,178
on something yeah yeah in Flour what

481
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:14,958
kind of like is cookies all the raid

482
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:16,879
like what so much it was very popular up

483
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:20,089
north for quite a while I don't know if

484
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:22,248
it still is now but right right now in

485
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:24,138
this area I feel like everybody's super

486
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:26,778
satiated with Gorilla Glue we're seeing

487
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:28,638
so much glue everywhere back and forth

488
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:33,858
and I feel like everyone in LA is kind

489
00:19:28,638 --> 00:19:35,328
of thick of it what's funny is that yeah

490
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:37,218
you really do

491
00:19:35,328 --> 00:19:38,898
yeah yeah I was gonna say the the cookie

492
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:40,729
space I think has come and gone already

493
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:42,138
and I think that's where we're getting

494
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:43,219
to with Gorilla Glue now is the bear

495
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,598
where then did we grill legal and

496
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:47,749
everyone's sick of it we're starting to

497
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:49,668
pass us by here so where's the high well

498
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:51,348
as funny as that everybody always at

499
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:53,239
least in this area predominantly

500
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:56,178
everybody really was looking for the og

501
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:57,619
really heavy indicas and normally what

502
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:59,690
we're seeing to find is a lot more

503
00:19:57,618 --> 00:20:01,939
hybrids not quite so so many of the

504
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,159
heavy indica strains so that's always I

505
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,209
always think that's kind of interesting

506
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,669
yeah because that's what people really

507
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:09,349
want though it's interesting to see that

508
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:14,100
there's not too much of it right now

509
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:16,538
what other like major trash

510
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:18,759
so I definitely think that just in

511
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:20,589
general the micro dosing in world as far

512
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,569
as edibles is really trending right now

513
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:23,769
because people are wanting to medicate

514
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:25,960
all day

515
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:28,179
without feeling slumped or maybe without

516
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,100
people other other people in their lives

517
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:34,889
knowing that they're high you know that

518
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:34,888
helps a lot so if I could show you

519
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:44,620
so micro dosing we have the petra's

520
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,409
those are two point five milligrams yeah

521
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:48,939
and those we just got we just got a

522
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:50,470
couple new flavors of those as well but

523
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,080
yeah the two point five milligrams

524
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,460
that's really nice we also have the dose

525
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:56,230
easements they're kind of like an orange

526
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,269
tic tac those again are only about two

527
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,798
milligrams per piece but in general

528
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:01,778
those type of things are really becoming

529
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:03,460
popular like I said because people can

530
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:06,128
use it throughout the day whether

531
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,870
they're you know at home at work maybe

532
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:09,339
just take the edge off of some stress

533
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:11,888
relief something like that without

534
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:14,259
feeling overwhelmingly high or anything

535
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:16,449
like that yeah those are very popular

536
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:18,700
but I mean edibles in general are

537
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,009
ranging from ten to five milligrams and

538
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,019
for not I don't want to say everybody

539
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:27,909
but for a lot of people five milligrams

540
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:31,569
is still pretty pretty micro dose now do

541
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:32,769
you deliver hopefully soon I'm not sure

542
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:35,109
about dates on that but we definitely

543
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:36,120
have talked about it now are you free to

544
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:37,740
talk a little bit of

545
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:40,709
like how many people you do a day or

546
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,210
what the range is or then to hundreds

547
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:45,079
but I'm not exactly sure on a specific

548
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:48,090
number that's still my right thing yeah

549
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:50,609
talk to me a little bit about my

550
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:52,589
favorite product pre-rolls

551
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:55,769
and what you're seeing stoppin and

552
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:57,209
pre-rolls becoming more and more popular

553
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:59,789
I think it's because of the convenience

554
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,470
factor about it everybody wants

555
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:04,379
something that's ready to go ready to

556
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,460
smoke right now also the fact that they

557
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,770
can just you know kind of keep it in

558
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:10,920
your pocket it's ready so we have things

559
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:13,379
like our house pre-roll packs these

560
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,759
little blacks foxes those ones I really

561
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,780
like as far as like what I was saying

562
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,920
earlier about just being able to throw

563
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:18,660
it in your pocket throw it in your purse

564
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,400
nothing will break you don't have to

565
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,800
worry about it and they're ready to go

566
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,280
for whatever it is to the beach to a

567
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:28,589
concert just life in general I really

568
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:30,000
enjoy those what's cool is that we also

569
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:31,859
have things like the canned essent

570
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,869
flight pack so if you already are

571
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,490
familiar with ken Desa and you've only

572
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:36,779
tried maybe one or two you haven't tried

573
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,670
the other ones that's a great way to go

574
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:41,099
because that includes one of every kind

575
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,600
of their joint so that's nice and that's

576
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:44,519
the whole thing too is I always talk

577
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,740
about how I really think that the

578
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,619
cannabis industry and the kind of craft

579
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,849
beer industry are super similar and you

580
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,839
know we're all doing things like that

581
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:53,309
you know where you could get a beer

582
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,769
flight same thing you can get a joint

583
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:57,899
flight so I really enjoy that kind of

584
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:59,849
about them also is there such a male

585
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,620
viewable product yeah they have infused

586
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:03,539
products infused with different ones you

587
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,549
can use a top flour and then also

588
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:07,259
they're all different sizes yes so if

589
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:08,419
you have like a really high to so you

590
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:10,129
can have a look

591
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,620
yeah and it's funny that you say that

592
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,570
because with our half gram $5 joints I

593
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:16,099
always refer to that as a personal size

594
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:18,019
joint because I feel like it's perfect

595
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:19,429
for just one person smoking by

596
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:21,170
themselves they're good to go and then

597
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,180
they can continue where other whereas

598
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,710
the $10 full gram joints you could

599
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,450
definitely share that with a friend and

600
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,759
something if you want to like

601
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:31,039
gender-wise or anything you there any

602
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:34,759
like you know things that you see like

603
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:38,690
our demographic oh they're definitely

604
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:40,819
are some things for short like so when

605
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,910
you're kind of in the like I want to say

606
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:45,139
like 30 to 50 mom category that's where

607
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,450
you're getting a lot of things like

608
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:53,000
convenience pre-rolls disposable vape

609
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:55,940
pens stuff like that also as far as that

610
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,410
same age range but with men I get a lot

611
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,470
more of just like the cartridges like

612
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,700
the one gram cartridges things like that

613
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,740
more into things that have to do with

614
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,630
like technology so lots of like the

615
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,839
batteries and the paws and things like

616
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:10,730
that if you're a mom is discretion also

617
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:12,319
oh yeah I would say so and I think

618
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,289
that's why the disposable pens are so

619
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:17,750
much more popular for that typical area

620
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:19,909
because they're small and skinny they

621
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,200
don't really look like anything they

622
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,000
don't smell and then as soon as you're

623
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,319
done you can throw away the evidence you

624
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
know what I mean so I think that's why

625
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,139
that becomes super popular same with the

626
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,390
pre-rolls as soon as you're done you can

627
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:32,660
just throw it you know it's oh it's gone

628
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:34,850
it's there's no evidence and then you

629
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,620
know as far as the older crowds go

630
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:39,469
whether it be male or female I think

631
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:41,989
it's really just about the buds or the

632
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,990
babes vapes have become very popular for

633
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:47,059
the older generation I think because a

634
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,250
lot of the flower that we're smoking

635
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:50,779
nowadays there's a lot stronger than

636
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:53,509
certain things that they were smoking

637
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:55,819
before and because of that the baked I

638
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:57,470
think are a nice kind of ease into it

639
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:59,359
and you can really control your high

640
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,670
better wear it with like one or two

641
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,439
puffs okay I feel like I can take a

642
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,390
little bit more or I need to cut back

643
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,640
whereas with your smoking just flowers

644
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:10,420
you might have gone too far without

645
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,420
noticing it
